Burp Suite: Configuration
Mutual Authentication Settings:
•Testers may encounter test scenarios 
wherein they must perform testing on 
Web API Endpoints which generally 
handle TLS/SSL authentication 
differently
•Burp can be configured to handle the 
authentication requirements in order 
to access these API endpoints if they 
require Mutual Authentication
•This can be configured by adding any 
provided Client TLS certificates that 
burp will automatically include in 
requests to API endpoints
