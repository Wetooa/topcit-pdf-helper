Active Testing : Testing for Weak Cryptography
Testing for Weak Transport 
Layer Security
•Validate the service 
configuration. 
•Review the digital 
certificate’s cryptographic 
strength and validity. 
•Ensure that the TLS 
security is not bypassable  
and is properly 
implemented across the 
application.
Testing for Padding Oracle
•Identify encrypted 
messages that rely on 
padding. 
•Attempt to break the 
padding of the encrypted 
messages and analyze the 
returned error messages 
for further analysis.
Testing for Sensitive 
Information Sent via 
Unencrypted Channels
•Identify sensitive 
information transmitted 
through the various 
channels. 
•Assess the privacy and 
security of the channels 
used.
Testing for Weak Encryption
•Provide a guideline for the 
identification weak 
encryption or hashing uses 
and implementations.
