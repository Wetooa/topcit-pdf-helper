Burp Suite: Configuration
Connection Settings:
•When testing a Web Application which 
requires Platform Authentication, Burp 
can be configured to automatically 
perform Basic, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 
Authentication for requests.
•Additionally, testers are allowed the 
option to set an upstream proxy server. 
This can be useful when they require 
traffic to be sent through to another 
proxy such as in the case when 
handling Kerberos authentication.
