Active Testing : Input Validation Testing
Testing for Incubated 
Vulnerability
•Identify injections that are 
stored and require a recall 
step to the stored injection. 
•Understand how a recall 
step could occur. 
•Set listeners or activate the 
recall step if possible.
Testing for HTTP Splitting 
Smuggling
•Assess if the application is 
vulnerable to splitting, 
identifying what possible 
attacks are achievable. 
•Assess if the chain of 
communication is 
vulnerable to smuggling, 
identifying what possible 
attacks are achievable.
Testing for HTTP Incoming 
Requests
•Monitor all incoming and 
outgoing HTTP requests to 
the Web Server to inspect 
any suspicious requests. 
•Monitor HTTP traffic 
without changes of end 
user Browser proxy or 
client -side application.
Testing for Host Header 
Injection
•Assess if the Host header is 
being parsed dynamically in 
the application. Bypass 
security controls that rely 
on the header.
Testing for Server
 -
Side 
Template Injection
•Detect template injection 
vulnerability points.
•Identify the templating 
engine. 
•Build the exploit.
Testing for Server
 -
Side 
Request Forgery
•Identify SSRF injection 
points. 
•Test if the injection points 
are exploitable. 
•Asses the severity of the 
vulnerability.
