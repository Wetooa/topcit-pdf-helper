Active Testing: Business Logic Testing
Test Business Logic 
Data Validation
•Identify data injection 
points. 
•Validate that all checks are 
occurring on the back end 
and can’t be bypassed.
•Attempt to break the 
format of the expected 
data and analyze how the 
application is handling it.
Test Ability to Forge Requests
•Review the project 
documentation looking for 
guessable, predictable, or 
hidden functionality of 
fields. 
•Insert logically valid data in 
order to bypass normal 
business logic workflow.
Test Integrity Checks
•Review the project 
documentation for 
components of the system 
that move, store, or handle 
data. 
•Determine what type of 
data is logically acceptable 
by the component and 
what types the system 
should guard against. 
Determine who should be 
allowed to modify or read 
that data in each 
component. 
•Attempt to insert, update, 
or delete data values  used 
by each component that 
should not be allowed per 
the business logic 
workflow.
Test for Process Timing
• Review the project 
documentation for system 
functionality that may be 
impacted by time. 
•Develop and execute 
misuse cases.
Test Number of Times A 
Function Can Be Used Without 
Limits
•Identify functions that must 
set limits to the times they 
can be called. 
•Assess if there is a logical 
limit set on the functions and 
if it is properly validated.
