TARGET IDENTIFICATION AND 
ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
TECHNIQUE
 CAPABILITIES
Network Discovery •Uses passive (examination) and active (testing) 
techniques to discover network devices
•Identifies communication paths and helps 
determine network architecture
Network Port and Service 
Identification•Uses a port scanner to identify network ports, 
services, and active devices.
Vulnerability Scanning •Identifies hosts, attributes, and known 
vulnerabilities (with high false positives).
Wireless Scanning •Enables devices to communicate wirelessly 
without physical connections
•Passive/Active Wireless Scanning
•Wireless Device Location Tracking
•Bluetooth Scanning
