Things to remember in Exploitation
Not all exploits work on all systems
•Not every exploit will work on every system.
•Testers need to be familiar with the different types of exploits for specific targets.
Some exploits are more effective than others
•Testers should use the most appropriate one for the situation.
•For example, if you’re exploiting a web application, it’s more appropriate to use XSS 
exploit instead of Buffer Overflow.
Some exploits require more setup than others
•Some exploits may require additional setup to work properly (e.g., changing firewall 
rules).
•Testers should be aware of these requirements before attempting any exploit.
Not all identified vulnerabilities can be exploited against the target
•Testers need to be familiar with the different types of vulnerabilities and what they can 
do.
•For example, some vulnerabilities may only allow an attacker to read common files, while 
others may allow an attacker to execute code on a system.
