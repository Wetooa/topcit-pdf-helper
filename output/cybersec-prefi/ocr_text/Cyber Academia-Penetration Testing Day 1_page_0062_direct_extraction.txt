Burp Suite: Configuration
Scope:
•Once a tester has identified the targets of the web 
application, it is of key importance to set these in 
the scope to ensure that only the relevant traffic 
needed for testing is captured by burp while 
unnecessary traffic is ignored.
oDue to the complexity of Web Applications, it is 
beneficial to restrict the scope for several 
reasons:
oTo assist the tester in carrying out the 
inspection of traffic sent between clients and 
the server only otherwise Burp may capture all 
traffic to other web applications or calls to 
URLs that should not be tested.
oTo ensure that automated scans only target 
and send payloads to the intended targets.
oTo help with focusing Burp’s automated spider 
mapping features to prevent recursive site 
discovery of a web application.
•Scope can be set to restrict captured traffic to 
multiple hosts based on Protocol, Port or File to 
ensure no important traffic is missed during testing.
