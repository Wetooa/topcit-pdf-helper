Active Testing: Business Logic Testing
Testing for the Circumvention 
of Workflows
•Review the project 
documentation for methods 
to skip or go through steps in 
the application process in a 
different order from the 
intended business logic flow. 
•Develop a misuse case and 
try to circumvent every logic 
flow identified.
Test Defenses Against 
Application Misuse
•Generate notes from all tests 
conducted against the 
system. 
•Review which tests had a 
different functionality based 
on aggressive input.
•Understand the defenses in 
place and verify if they are 
enough to protect the system 
against bypassing 
techniques.
Test Upload of 
Unexpected File Types
•Review the project 
documentation for file types 
that are rejected by the 
system. 
•Verify that the unwelcomed 
file types are rejected and 
handled safely. 
• Verify that file batch uploads 
are secure and do not allow 
any bypass against the set 
security measures.
 Test Upload of 
Malicious Files
•Identify  the file upload  
functionality . Review  the project  
documentation  to identify  what  
file types  are considered  
acceptable,  and what  types  
would  be considered  dangerous  
or malicious . Obtain  or create  a 
set of malicious  files for testing . 
Try to upload  the malicious  files 
to the application  and 
determine  whether  it is 
accepted  and processed .
