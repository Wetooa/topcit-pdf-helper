 DESCRIPTION
Reporting •Penetration testing reports should be clear, 
concise, and informative, detailing the 
methodology, identified vulnerabilities, and 
remediation steps. Reports should include an 
executive summary for sharing across different 
organizational levels.
Retest •After remediation efforts are implemented, it's 
crucial to retest the system or application to 
ensure that the vulnerabilities have been 
successfully fixed. A retester can confirm that the 
security posture has improved and that the fixes 
are effective.
