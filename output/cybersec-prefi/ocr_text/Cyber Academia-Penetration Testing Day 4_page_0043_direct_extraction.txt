CVSS Base Metrics 
 –
 
Availability
Availability : This metric measures the impact to the availability of the 
impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited 
vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply 
to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) 
used by the impacted component, this metric refers to the loss of 
availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked 
service (e.g., web, database, email)
