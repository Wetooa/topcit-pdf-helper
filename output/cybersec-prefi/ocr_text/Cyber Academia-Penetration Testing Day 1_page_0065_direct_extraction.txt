Burp Suite: Configuration
Burp Suite Extensions:
•PortSwigger  provides access to their API to enable 
anyone to further extend its capabilities by building 
their own extensions which can be added to your 
Burp deployment.
•These extensions can be found within BurpSuite  and 
installed directly from the User Interface but can 
alternatively be downloaded from PortSwigger’s  
official site and imported manually into your Burp 
installation.
•There exists a wide range of extensions that serve 
to assist testers in automating and simplifying their 
tests to save on time and effort in identifying 
vulnerabilities or points of interest on an application 
throughout their test.
•It should be noted that these are built and rated by 
the community. As such, further validation and 
testing may be required for some of these 
extensions.
