REPORTING: Pentest Technical Report

Description
To install Fe sy client the user documentation recommends to execute the following command:
b B Al a p Lol Sl Colll WG - bl B

The installation script is dynamically generated by the g === to include details for the version
requested by the user.

During testing, we discovered that the version taken from the URL path is parsed using © . r and
included within the template bash script with no sanitization.

#!/bin/bash
# This script downloads the [lversionl! build of t »e and installs it on the target machine

As a result, an attacker can craft a URL that will include arbitrary commands within the installation script.
Please note that other injection points exist within the same script.

A similar problem occurs in the endpoint used to join a cluster. The GetSitelnstructions() function does
not sanitize the serverProfile parameter which is reflected in the following script:

s T FEI | b * LB el BS ) B o S
--token=95 ic \

--advertise-addr- \

--role-fi i

--cloud-provider \

--operation-id-
