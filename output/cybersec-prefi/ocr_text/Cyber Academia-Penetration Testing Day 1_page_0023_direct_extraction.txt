Cryptographic Failures
•Failures related tomissing, weak, orimproperly implemented cryptography
•Includes poor encryption practices anexposed ormismanaged cryptographic keysWhat it is:
Common Causes:
•Weak oroutdated encryption algorithms
•Insufficient randomness (poor entropy)
•Predictable orbroken random generators
Examples:
•Storing passwords without hashing
•Using weak encryption orcustom crypto
•Poor TLS/SSL configuration
