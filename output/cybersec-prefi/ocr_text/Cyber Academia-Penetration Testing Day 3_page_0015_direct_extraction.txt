Active Testing: Information Gathering
Conduct Search Engine 
Discovery Reconnaissance for 
Information Leakage
•Identify what sensitive design and 
configuration information of the

organization is exposed directly 
(on the organization’s website) or 
indirectly (via third -party 
services).
Fingerprint Web Server
•Determine the version and type 
of a running web server to enable 
further discovery of any known 
vulnerabilities.
Review Webserver Metafiles 
for Information Leakage
•Identify hidden or obfuscated 
paths and functionality through 
the analysis of metadata files.
• 
•Extract and map other 
information that could lead to 
better understanding of the 
systems at hand.
Enumerate Applications on 
Webserver
•Enumerate the applications 
within scope that exist on a web 
server.
Review Webpage Content for 
Information Leakage
•Review webpage comments and 
metadata to find any information 
leakage.

review the JS code to better 
understand the application and to
