OWASP Testing Methodology
The OWASP Web Application Security Testing method is based 
on the black box approach. The tester knows nothing or has very 
little information about the application to be tested.
The testing model consists of:
Tester  – Who performs the testing activities 
Tools and Methodology – The core of this 
Testing Guide Project
Application  – The black box to test
