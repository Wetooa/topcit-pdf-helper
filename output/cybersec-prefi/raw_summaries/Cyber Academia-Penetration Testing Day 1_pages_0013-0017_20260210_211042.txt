## Learning Guide: Penetration Testing Basics

### 1. Rules of Engagement: Legal & Ethical Foundations

Before any penetration testing (pentesting) begins, strict rules must be followed to ensure it's legal, ethical, and effective.

*   **Explicit Authorization:** Testing must always be formally and clearly approved.
*   **Defined Scope:** The exact boundaries and objectives of the test must be agreed upon beforehand.
*   **Data Confidentiality:** All sensitive information encountered must be handled with the highest level of confidentiality.
*   **Legal Compliance:** All activities must adhere to relevant contracts, laws, and regulations.
*   **Written Permission is Mandatory:** No testing can occur without explicit, documented permission.
    *   **Crucial Note:** Without written permission, any unauthorized testing is considered hacking, not legitimate security assessment.

### 2. Legal & Ethical Considerations: Data Protection & Responsibility

Protecting data and acting responsibly are paramount during pentesting.

*   **Personal Data Protection:**
    *   Minimize access to personal data.
    *   Only access data explicitly authorized for the test.
    *   Reports must use anonymized or redacted (edited to hide sensitive info) data.
    *   **Never** store, alter, or misuse client data.
*   **Contractual Adherence:** All testing activities must strictly follow agreed-upon contractual agreements.
*   **Key Principle:** "Access does not mean permission to misuse."

### 3. Penetration Testing Standards

Penetration testing standards provide a framework for conducting security assessments.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Offer guidelines and methodologies for ethical testing.
    *   Ensure tests are consistent, safe, and can be repeated.
    *   Help define the scope, process, and reporting methods.
    *   Align security testing with established industry best practices.

### 4. The Pentesting Process

Penetration testing follows a structured, multi-step approach:

1.  **Planning & Scoping:**
    *   Define the test's scope (what will be tested).
    *   Establish rules of engagement (how it will be tested).
    *   Set clear objectives (what outcomes are expected).
2.  **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering):**
    *   Collect information about the target.
    *   Examples: IP addresses, open ports, software versions, system architecture.
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Identify known weaknesses and vulnerabilities in systems using automated tools.
    *   This step finds potential entry points or flaws.
4.  **Exploitation:**
    *   Attempt to actively exploit (take advantage of) identified vulnerabilities.
    *   This can be done manually or using specialized tools to gain unauthorized access or control.
5.  **Post-Exploitation:**
    *   After successful exploitation, assess the impact of the breach.
    *   Determine what level of access was gained and what further actions could be performed (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration).
6.  **Reporting:**
    *   Document all findings, including exploited vulnerabilities and their impact.
    *   Provide clear, actionable recommendations for remediation (fixing the issues).

PENTESTING PROCESS:
1.Planning & Scoping : Define scope, rules, 
and objectives.
2.Reconnaissance : Gather information (IPs, 
ports, versions)
3.Vulnerability Scanning : Identify known 
weaknesses, vulnerabilities
4.Exploitation : Exploit identified 
vulnerabilities manually or with tools.
5.Post -exploitation : Assess the impact and 
potential access gained.
6.Reporting : Document findings and 
remediation recommendations.
