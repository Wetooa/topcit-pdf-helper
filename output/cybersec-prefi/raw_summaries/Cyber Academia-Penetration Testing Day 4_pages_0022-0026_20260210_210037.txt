## Learning Guide: Penetration Test Report Structure

This guide breaks down the essential sections of a Penetration Test (Pentest) Report, explaining what information each part contains.

---

### 1. Pentest Overview

This section provides an introduction to the report's structure and contents. It typically includes:

*   **Background:** The purpose and scope of the pentest.
*   **Tester and Application Details:** Information about the testing engagement and the target application.
*   **Pentest Findings Overview:** A summary of the vulnerabilities found.
*   **Pentest Technical Report:** Detailed information on each vulnerability.

---

### 2. Background: Executive Summary

This part explains why the pentest was conducted and what it aimed to achieve.

*   **Purpose:** To determine the target's (e.g., "siw s") exposure to a targeted attack.
*   **Methodology:** Activities simulated a malicious attacker engaged in a targeted attack.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Identify if a remote attacker could penetrate defenses.
    *   Determine the impact of a security breach on:
        *   Confidentiality of private data.
        *   Internal infrastructure and availability of information systems.
*   **Focus:** Identifying and exploiting weaknesses allowing unauthorized access to data.
*   **Access Level:** Attacks were conducted with the same access as a general Internet user.
*   **Compliance:** Assessment followed industry recommendations (e.g., "™% == ¢") under controlled conditions.

---

### 3. Application Details

This section provides specific metadata about the target(s) and the pentest engagement.

#### A. Target Metadata

*   **Name:** The official name of the application or system tested.
*   **Type:** General classification (e.g., Protocol Specification and Implementation).
*   **Platforms:** The technologies or environments the target runs on (e.g., "I o").

#### B. Engagement Data

*   **Type:** The nature of the assessment (e.g., Specification and Implementation Review).
*   **Method:** Specific testing approach (e.g., "sl A0 B e -").
*   **Dates:** The start and end dates of the penetration test (e.g., June 1, 2020, to August 14, 2020).
*   **Consultants:** Number of security consultants involved.
*   **Level of Effort:** Total work invested (e.g., 16 person-days).

#### C. Targets

*   **Specific URLs/Implementations:** A list of the exact systems, applications, or codebases that were tested.
    *   Examples: `https://fia='p-0214`, `https://github.com/s w ams s 14560`

#### D. Finding Breakdown

*   A summary of issues found, categorized by severity:
    *   Critical issues
    *   High issues
    *   Medium issues
    *   Low issues
    *   Informational issues
    *   Total issues

---

### 4. Pentest Findings Overview

This section provides a high-level summary of the vulnerabilities discovered during the pentest. It typically lists:

*   **Vulnerability Class:** The general category of the weakness (e.g., Injection Flaws, Cryptography Missing).
*   **Severity:** The impact level of the vulnerability (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational).
*   **Status:** The current state of the vulnerability (e.g., Open, Closed).
    *   **Open:** The vulnerability still exists or needs to be addressed.
    *   **Closed:** The vulnerability has been fixed or remediated.

**Examples:**
*   **Install Scripts Command Injection:** Medium Severity, Closed (Injection Flaws)
*   **Insecure Default Connection During Package Upload and Upgrade:** Low Severity, Open (Cryptography Missing Authentication)
*   **Application Bundles Insecure Decompress:** High Severity, Closed (Injection Flaws)

---

### 5. Pentest Technical Report

This section provides the detailed documentation for each individual vulnerability found by the tester in the target application. For each vulnerability, you will find:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** A concise title for the specific weakness.
*   **Vulnerability Description:** A detailed explanation of the vulnerability, how it works, and why it's a security risk.
*   **Exploitability and Impact:** Information on how easily the vulnerability could be exploited and the potential consequences if exploited.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:** A clear, step-by-step guide on how the tester identified and confirmed the vulnerability. This allows others to replicate the finding.
*   **Recommendation:** Specific advice and actions for how to fix or mitigate the vulnerability.

REPORTING: Background

Executive Summary

I ew "siw s was contracted by BeSETaE W to conduct a penetration test in order to
determine its exposure to a targeted attack. All activities were conducted in a manner that simulated a
malicious actor engaged in a targeted attack against ey = ‘= "ws with the goals of:

o ldentifying if a remote attacker could penetrate s g ww - defenses
o Determining the impact of a security breach on:
o Confidentiality of the company’s private data

o Internal infrastructure and availability of msg# =y - = y information systems

Efforts were placed on the identification and exploitation of security weaknesses that could allow a
remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to organizational data. The attacks were conducted with
the level of access that a general Internet user would have. The assessment was conducted in
accordance with the recommendations outlined in ™% == ¢ with all tests and actions being

conducted under controlled conditions.
