### **Learning Guide: Network & Web Security Reconnaissance Tools**

This guide outlines key outputs and functions of common tools used for network and web security reconnaissance.

---

### **1. Shodan: Internet-Connected Device Search Engine**

**Purpose:** Shodan scans the internet to find devices and services based on various criteria (e.g., open ports, banners, geographical location). It helps identify an organization's publicly exposed assets.

**Key Information from Shodan Output:**

*   **SSL Certificate Details:** Information about the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates used by web services.
    *   **Issued By:** Entity that issued the certificate (Common Name, Organization, Primary Intermediate Server CA).
    *   **Issued To:** The entity for which the certificate was issued (Common Name, Organization).
    *   **Supported SSL Versions:** Cryptographic protocols supported by the service.
        *   `SSLv2`, `SSLv3`: Older, less secure versions of SSL.
        *   `TLSv1`: A more secure, modern successor to SSL (though older than TLSv1.2/1.3).
*   **Open Ports and Services:** Identifies services running on accessible ports.
    *   `HTTPS (8443)`: Secure HTTP on port 8443.
    *   `HTTP (8080)`: HTTP on port 8080.
    *   `4443`: Unspecified port, often used for various services.
    *   `HTTP (81)`: HTTP on port 81.
*   **Geographical Distribution:** Shows the approximate location of identified hosts (e.g., Poland, China, United States, Russian Federation, Pakistan).

---

### **2. Nmap: Network Scanner**

**Purpose:** Nmap (Network Mapper) is a utility used for network discovery and security auditing. It identifies active hosts and services on a network by analyzing packet responses.

**Key Information from Nmap Scan Report:**

*   **Host Status:** Indicates if the target system is online and responsive.
    *   `Host is up`: The target system is active.
    *   `Latency`: Measures the response time (e.g., `0.15s`).
*   **Port States:** Describes the status of scanned ports.
    *   `open`: An application is actively listening and accepting connections on this port.
    *   `filtered`: A firewall or network device is blocking the port, preventing Nmap from determining its status.
    *   `Not shown: 89 filtered ports`: Indicates many ports were blocked/unreachable.
*   **Identified Services:** For `open` ports, Nmap identifies the running service.
    *   `PORT STATE SERVICE`: Provides a clear mapping of port number, state, and service name.
    *   **Common Services Identified:** `ftp`, `ssh`, `telnet`, `smtp`, `http`, `netbios-ssn`, `https`, `microsoft-ds`, `ms-wbt-server`, `http-proxy`.
*   **Scan Details:** Includes Nmap version (`Nmap 7.90`) and the timestamp of the scan.

### **3. Burp Suite: Web Application Security Testing Platform**

**Purpose:** Burp Suite is an integrated platform for comprehensive security testing of web applications. It provides various tools to intercept, analyze, and manipulate HTTP/S traffic.

**Key Components (Tabs):**

*   **Dashboard:** Project overview and general information.
*   **Target:** Defines the scope of testing and maps the target application's structure.
*   **Proxy:** Intercepts and allows modification of all HTTP/S traffic between the browser and the target server.
*   **Intruder:** Automates customized attacks (e.g., brute-force, fuzzing).
*   **Repeater:** Manually modifies and re-sends individual HTTP requests, viewing responses.
*   **Sequencer:** Analyzes the randomness of session tokens.
*   **Decoder:** Performs various data transformations (e.g., URL, HTML, Base64 encoding/decoding).
*   **Comparer:** Performs a visual difference check between two data items.
*   **Extender:** Manages Burp Suite extensions for added features.
*   **Project:** Stores project-specific settings and data.

**Proxy/Target Functionality & Output:**

*   **Traffic History:** Displays a chronological list of all HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Traffic Filtering:** Options to hide specific types of content to focus analysis (e.g., hiding CSS, images, 4xx error responses).
*   **HTTP Request Details:** Shows the raw structure of an intercepted HTTP request.
    *   **Method:** The action requested (e.g., `GET`).
    *   **Path:** The specific resource on the server (e.g., `/robots.txt`).
    *   **Protocol:** `HTTP/1.1`.
    *   **Host Header:** Specifies the target server's domain (e.g., `example.net`).
    *   **Headers:** Additional information about the request (e.g., `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, `Accept`).
*   **Request/Response View:** Allows viewing full headers and body content of both the request and response in plain text or hexadecimal format.
