# Learning Guide: Penetration Testing & OWASP Top 10

## 1. Penetration Testing Standards

**Purpose:**
*   Guide ethical security testing methodologies.
*   Ensure testing is consistent, safe, and repeatable.
*   Help define testing scope, process, and reporting.
*   Align security testing with industry best practices.

## 2. The Penetration Testing Process

A standard penetration test follows these steps:

1.  **Planning & Scoping:** Define the test's objectives, rules of engagement, and specific systems (scope) to be tested.
2.  **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target (e.g., IP addresses, open ports, software versions).
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to identify known weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the target systems.
4.  **Exploitation:** Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access or demonstrate impact, either manually or using tools.
5.  **Post-exploitation:** Assess the impact of the exploitation, determine the level of access gained, and identify potential further actions.
6.  **Reporting:** Document all findings, including vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and provide recommendations for remediation.

## 3. OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 (2025 version referenced) is a widely recognized list of the **most critical web application security risks.**

### OWASP Top 10 List:

*   **A01: Broken Access Control**
*   **A02: Security Misconfiguration**
*   **A03: Software Supply Chain Failures**
*   **A04: Cryptographic Failure**
*   **A05: Injection**
*   **A06: Insecure Design**
*   **A07: Authentication Failures**
*   **A08: Software or Data Integrity Failures**
*   **A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures**
*   **A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions**

### Detail: A01: Broken Access Control (2025)

*   **What it is:** Occurs when users can access data or perform actions they are not authorized to.
    *   **Cause:** Missing or weak **authorization checks** (the process of verifying if a user has permission for a specific action or resource).
*   **Why it's #1:**
    *   Still the most common and impactful web application risk.
    *   Often leads to data exposure, **privilege escalation** (gaining higher access rights than intended), or full account takeover.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Accessing another user's private data by simply changing an ID number in a URL.
    *   Performing administrator-level actions while logged in as a regular user.

PENTESTING PROCESS:
1.Planning & Scoping : Define scope, rules, 
and objectives.
2.Reconnaissance : Gather information (IPs, 
ports, versions)
3.Vulnerability Scanning : Identify known 
weaknesses, vulnerabilities
4.Exploitation : Exploit identified 
vulnerabilities manually or with tools.
5.Post -exploitation : Assess the impact and 
potential access gained.
6.Reporting : Document findings and 
remediation recommendations.

Broken Access Control
•Happens when users canaccess data oractions they shouldn't
•Caused bymissing orweak authorization checks
What it is:
Why it's #1
•Still themost common andmost impactful web apprisk
•Often leads todate exposure, privilege, escalation, orfullaccount takeover
Examples:
•Accessing another user's data bychanging anID
•Performing admin actions asanormal user
