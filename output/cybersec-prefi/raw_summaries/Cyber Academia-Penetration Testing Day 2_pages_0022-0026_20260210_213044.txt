## OSINT Fundamentals: A Learning Guide

This guide condenses essential information on Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and common tools, providing a clear, concise overview for study.

---

### 1. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

*   **Definition:** The process of gathering and analyzing information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence.
*   **Purpose:** To find, select, acquire, and analyze data that is openly accessible.

---

### 2. Key Information to Gather (OSINT Output Focus)

When performing OSINT on a target, focus on identifying:

*   **Running Services:** What applications or functionalities are active on the target's servers.
*   **Technology Stack:** The underlying technologies, frameworks, and software used (e.g., web server, database, programming languages).
*   **Core Functionalities/Use Cases:** The primary purposes and capabilities of the target system or application.
*   **Protection Mechanisms:** Any security measures or defenses in place (e.g., firewalls, WAFs, specific authentication methods).

---

### 3. Essential OSINT Tools & Techniques

#### 3.1. Shodan.io

*   **What it is:** A search engine for internet-connected devices. Unlike Google, which searches websites, Shodan searches for servers, webcams, printers, routers, and more that are directly connected to the internet.
*   **What it reveals:**
    *   **Exposed Services & Ports:** Identifies open ports and the services running on them (e.g., HTTPS 8443, HTTP 8080).
    *   **Geographical Location:** Shows the country and sometimes city where devices are located.
    *   **SSL Certificate Details:** Provides information about SSL/TLS certificates, including:
        *   **Issued By:** The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.
        *   **Common Name:** The domain name(s) the certificate is issued for (e.g., `bi.pl`, `wle.pl`).
        *   **Organization:** The organization associated with the certificate.
        *   **Supported SSL/TLS Versions:** Lists the cryptographic protocols supported (e.g., SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1). *Note: SSLv2/v3 are outdated and insecure, while TLSv1.2/1.3 are current best practices.*

#### 3.2. Nmap (Network Mapper)

*   **What it is:** A free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It's primarily used for port scanning.
*   **What an Nmap scan report shows:**
    *   **Host Status:** Whether the target host is `up` (online) or `down` (offline).
    *   **Latency:** The response time from the host.
    *   **Open Ports:** Lists ports that are actively listening for connections.
    *   **Port State:** Indicates if a port is `open`, `closed`, or `filtered`.
        *   `open`: An application is actively accepting TCP connections or UDP datagrams on this port.
        *   `filtered`: A firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port, preventing Nmap from determining if it's open.
    *   **Service Name:** Identifies the common service running on an open port (e.g., `http` on port 80, `https` on port 443, `ssh` on port 22).
    *   **Nmap Version & Scan Time:** Provides details about the scan execution.
