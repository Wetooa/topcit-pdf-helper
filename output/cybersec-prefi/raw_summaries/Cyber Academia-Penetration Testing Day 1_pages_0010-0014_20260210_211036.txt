## Penetration Testing: Types & Ethical Guidelines

This guide covers different types of penetration tests and the crucial legal and ethical considerations involved.

---

### 1. Web Application Penetration Testing

*   **What it is:** Audits for security vulnerabilities stemming from the insecure design, development, or coding of web applications.
*   **Focus:** Identifying weaknesses specific to how web apps are built and function.

---

### 2. Client-Side Penetration Testing

*   **What it is:** Audits for security weaknesses within client-side applications. These are programs that run directly on a user's device.
*   **Common Client-Side Applications & Targets:**
    *   Putty (SSH client)
    *   Email Clients (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird)
    *   Web Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
    *   Third-party plugins and libraries used by these applications.

---

### 3. Social Engineering Penetration Testing

*   **What it is:** Tests how effectively attackers can trick *people* (rather than exploiting system vulnerabilities) into revealing sensitive information or granting unauthorized access.
*   **Common Social Engineering Attack Types:**
    *   **Digital:**
        *   **Phishing:** Deceptive emails or messages to obtain sensitive information (e.g., login credentials).
        *   **Smishing:** Phishing via SMS (text messages).
        *   **Vishing:** Phishing via voice calls (phone calls).
    *   **Physical:**
        *   **Tailgating:** Following an authorized person into a restricted area without permission.
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Secretly listening to private conversations to gather information.
        *   **Dumpster Diving:** Searching through discarded trash for sensitive documents or information.
    *   **Psychological:**
        *   **Impersonation:** Pretending to be someone else (e.g., an IT technician, a senior manager) to gain trust or access.
        *   **Pretexting:** Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to manipulate a target into divulging information or performing an action.
        *   **Name Dropping:** Using familiar or influential names to establish credibility or falsely imply authority.

---

### 4. Legal & Ethical Rules of Engagement

These rules are critical for any penetration testing activity to be legitimate and legal.

*   **Authorization:** Testing must be **EXPLICITLY authorized** by the client.
*   **Written Permission:** **No testing** should occur without **written permission**. Without it, the activity is considered hacking, not testing.
*   **Scope Definition:** The scope of the testing must be clearly defined and agreed upon before any work begins.
*   **Confidentiality:** All sensitive data encountered during testing must be handled with strict confidentiality.
*   **Governance:** All activities are governed by contractual agreements and applicable laws.

---

### 5. Legal & Ethical Data Protection & Responsibility

Key principles for handling data during penetration testing to ensure legality and ethical conduct.

*   **Data Protection & Minimization:** Personal data must be protected and kept to an absolute minimum required for testing.
*   **Authorized Data Access:** Only data explicitly authorized for access during testing should be touched.
*   **Anonymized Reporting:** Reports generated from testing must use anonymized or redacted data to protect privacy.
*   **No Misuse of Data:** Client data must never be stored, altered, or misused in any way by the testers.
*   **Contractual Compliance:** All testing activities must strictly follow contractual agreements.
*   **Core Principle:** "Access does not mean permission to misuse." Always remember that gaining access to a system or data during a test does not grant permission to do anything beyond the agreed-upon scope or misuse that access.

Testing must be EXPLICITLY authorized
Scope must be clearly defined before testing
Sensitive data must be handled confidentially
Activate governed by contracts & laws
No testing without WRITTEN PERMISSION
Without permission, it's hacking not testing
