# Post-Exploitation Learning Guide

## 1. What is Post-Exploitation?
*   This phase occurs **after** an attacker has successfully gained initial access to a system or network.
*   It involves all subsequent actions taken by the attacker once inside.

## 2. Key Objectives & Activities

During the post-exploitation phase, attackers primarily aim to:

*   **Maintain Persistence:** Secure ongoing access to the system, even after reboots or credential changes.
*   **Escalate Privileges:** Gain higher access rights (e.g., move from a standard user to an administrator).
*   **Perform Reconnaissance:** Gather more information about the compromised system and the wider network (e.g., user accounts, shared drives, network structure).
*   **Move Laterally:** Spread from the initially compromised system to other systems within the network.
*   **Ex-filtrate Data:** Steal sensitive information by transferring it out of the compromised network.
*   **Cover Their Tracks:** Eliminate evidence of their presence and activities to avoid detection.
*   **Use as a Platform:** Utilize the compromised system as a base for launching further attacks on other targets or systems.

Post -exploitation refers to the phase of a cyber attack that 
occurs after an attacker has successfully gained access to a 
system or network.

Exploitation
During this phase, the attacker attempts to maintain persistent access, 
escalate their privileges, and gather sensitive information or perform 
malicious activities .
