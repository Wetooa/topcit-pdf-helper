## Cybersecurity Learning Guide: Key Vulnerabilities & Technical Assessment

---

### Part 1: Common Application Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 - 2025 Draft)

#### A09:2025 – Security Logging and Alerting Failures

**What it is:**
*   Occurs when security-related events are not properly logged, monitored, or alerted.
*   Attacks happen, but no one notices them in time.

**Common Issues:**
*   Logs are unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent.
*   Lack of real-time monitoring and alerts.
*   Sensitive data is written directly into logs.

**Why it matters:**
*   Attacks go undetected for long periods.
*   Delayed response increases damage and data loss.
*   Makes incident response and forensic analysis difficult or impossible.

---

#### A10:2025 – Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

**What it is:**
*   Happens when applications do not properly handle errors or unexpected situations.

**Common Issues:**
*   Error messages expose sensitive data (e.g., database errors, internal paths).
*   Applications crash or behave unpredictably.
*   Systems "fail open" (grant access) instead of "failing securely" (denying access) when errors occur.
*   Missing or improper error handling logic.

**Examples:**
*   Stack traces (detailed error messages showing internal code) displayed to users.
*   An app crashes when required input is missing.
*   Access is granted due to an error during an authentication check.

### Part 2: Technical Assessment Techniques

These techniques help identify weaknesses and potential attack vectors in systems.

#### 1. Target Identification & Analysis Techniques

**Purpose:** To discover what systems, ports, services, and vulnerabilities exist.
**Think:** "What exists and what's exposed?"
**How:** Typically uses automated tools, but can be done manually.

| Technique                        | Capabilities                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Discovery**            | • Identifies network devices using passive (examination) and active (testing) methods.                     |
|                                  | • Maps communication paths and network architecture.                                                       |
| **Network Port & Service Ident.** | • Uses a port scanner to identify open network ports, running services, and active devices.                |
| **Vulnerability Scanning**       | • Identifies hosts, system attributes, and *known* vulnerabilities.                                        |
|                                  | • Often produces a high number of false positives (flags issues that aren't actual vulnerabilities).     |
| **Wireless Scanning**            | • Allows communication without physical connections.                                                       |
|                                  | • Includes passive/active scanning for wireless networks.                                                  |
|                                  | • Can track wireless device locations.                                                                     |
|                                  | • Includes Bluetooth scanning.                                                                             |

#### 2. Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques

**Purpose:** To confirm whether identified vulnerabilities can actually be exploited and abused.
**Think:** "Can this actually be abused?"
**How:** Can be performed manually or with automated tools, depending on the technique and team skills.

| Technique                      | Capabilities                                                                           |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Password Cracking**          | • Identifies weak passwords and poor password policies.                                |
| **Penetration Testing (Pentest)** | • Simulates attacker methods and tools to test security.                               |
|                                | • Verifies and demonstrates the exploitability of vulnerabilities to gain access.      |
| **Social Engineering**         | • Tests human vulnerabilities, procedures, and user awareness (e.g., phishing tests).  |
