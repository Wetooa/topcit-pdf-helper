Learning Guide: Burp Suite Configuration

---

### 1. Introduction: Burp Suite as a Proxy

*   **Core Function:** Burp Suite acts as a **proxy** between your web browser and a target web server/API.
*   **Capability:** This allows you to **view, intercept, and modify** all web requests and responses for testing purposes.
*   **Settings Access:** All configuration options are found within the **Settings Menu**.

### 2. Setting Your Scope

*   **Definition:** **Scope** defines which web traffic Burp Suite should capture and process.
*   **Importance:** It's crucial to set scope to ensure you only capture **relevant traffic** for your target application, ignoring unnecessary data.
*   **Why Restrict Scope?**
    *   **Focused Inspection:** Helps you concentrate on traffic specifically related to your target application, avoiding irrelevant requests (e.g., to other domains, external resources).
    *   **Automated Tool Control:** Ensures automated scans and tools only target and send payloads to your intended hosts, preventing unintended actions.
    *   **Efficiency:** Prevents Burp's spider and other features from getting lost in recursive site discovery or processing irrelevant data.
*   **How to Set Scope:** You can restrict captured traffic based on:
    *   Protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)
    *   Port (e.g., 80, 443)
    *   File
    *   You can include multiple hosts within your defined scope.

### 3. Connection Settings

*   **Platform Authentication:** Burp Suite can be configured to automatically handle common platform authentication types:
    *   Basic Authentication
    *   NTLMv1
    *   NTLMv2
*   **Upstream Proxy Server:** You have the option to configure an **upstream proxy** server. This is useful when your traffic needs to pass through another proxy (e.g., for handling Kerberos authentication).

### 4. Mutual Authentication Settings

*   **Scenario:** Used when testing Web API Endpoints that require **Mutual Authentication** (where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates).
*   **Configuration:** You can configure Burp to handle these requirements by adding the necessary **Client TLS Certificates**.
*   **Functionality:** Burp will automatically include these client certificates in requests sent to the API endpoints.

### 5. Burp Suite Extensions (BApps)

*   **Purpose:** Extensions allow you to **extend Burp Suite's capabilities** beyond its core features, often automating tasks or adding specialized tools.
*   **Source:** Developed by the community using the **PortSwigger API**.
*   **Installation Methods:**
    *   **Directly:** From within Burp Suite's User Interface (via the BApp Store).
    *   **Manually:** Downloaded from PortSwigger's official website and then imported into your Burp installation.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Automate and simplify complex testing procedures.
    *   Save time and effort during vulnerability identification.
*   **Important Note:** Extensions are community-built and rated. It is advisable to perform **further validation and testing** for some extensions before relying on them completely.

Burp Suite: Configuration
Settings Menu:
•One of Burp Suite’s main features is its capability as a proxy between a web browser 
and the target web server/API endpoint which allows testers to view, intercept and 
modify all requests and responses for testing.
•All relevant settings can be accessed within the settings menu.

Scope:
•Once a tester has identified the targets of the web 
application, it is of key importance to set these in 
the scope to ensure that only the relevant traffic 
needed for testing is captured by burp while 
unnecessary traffic is ignored.
oDue to the complexity of Web Applications, it is 
beneficial to restrict the scope for several 
reasons:
oTo assist the tester in carrying out the 
inspection of traffic sent between clients and 
the server only otherwise Burp may capture all 
traffic to other web applications or calls to 
URLs that should not be tested.
oTo ensure that automated scans only target 
and send payloads to the intended targets.
oTo help with focusing Burp’s automated spider 
mapping features to prevent recursive site 
discovery of a web application.
•Scope can be set to restrict captured traffic to 
multiple hosts based on Protocol, Port or File to 
ensure no important traffic is missed during testing.

Burp Suite: Configuration
Connection Settings:
•When testing a Web Application which 
requires Platform Authentication, Burp 
can be configured to automatically 
perform Basic, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 
Authentication for requests.
•Additionally, testers are allowed the 
option to set an upstream proxy server. 
This can be useful when they require 
traffic to be sent through to another 
proxy such as in the case when 
handling Kerberos authentication.

Mutual Authentication Settings:
•Testers may encounter test scenarios 
wherein they must perform testing on 
Web API Endpoints which generally 
handle TLS/SSL authentication 
differently
•Burp can be configured to handle the 
authentication requirements in order 
to access these API endpoints if they 
require Mutual Authentication
•This can be configured by adding any 
provided Client TLS certificates that 
burp will automatically include in 
requests to API endpoints

Burp Suite Extensions:
•PortSwigger  provides access to their API to enable 
anyone to further extend its capabilities by building 
their own extensions which can be added to your 
Burp deployment.
•These extensions can be found within BurpSuite  and 
installed directly from the User Interface but can 
alternatively be downloaded from PortSwigger’s  
official site and imported manually into your Burp 
installation.
•There exists a wide range of extensions that serve 
to assist testers in automating and simplifying their 
tests to save on time and effort in identifying 
vulnerabilities or points of interest on an application 
throughout their test.
•It should be noted that these are built and rated by 
the community. As such, further validation and 
testing may be required for some of these 
extensions.
