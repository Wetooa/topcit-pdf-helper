# Learning Guide: Network & Security Tools

This guide covers essential information about SQLMap, Nmap, and GoWitness, extracted from pages 49-53.

---

## 1. SQLMap

**Purpose:**
*   An automated SQL injection tool.
*   Reveals detailed server information.
*   Lists available databases on a target system.

---

## 2. Nmap (Network Mapper)

**Definition:**
*   A popular, open-source tool used for network exploration and security auditing.

**Key Features:**
*   **Port Scanning:** Identifies open ports and the services running on them.
*   **Host Discovery:** Finds active hosts on a network.
*   **Service Detection:** Determines the software and version numbers of services.
*   **OS Detection:** Identifies the operating system running on a host.
*   **Scriptable Interaction:** Can be used with scripts to automate tasks and extend its capabilities.

**Installation:**
*   Pre-installed by default in Kali Linux.
*   Also available for download from [nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html).

**Basic Usage:**
*   **Command Syntax:** `nmap <IP address>`
*   **Example:** `nmap 192.168.1.1`

**Interpreting Basic Scan Output:**
A typical Nmap output for `nmap <IP address>` will show:
*   **Host Status:** Indicates if the target host is "up" and its latency.
*   **Port State Service:** A list of ports, their status (e.g., "open"), and the identified service running on that port (e.g., HTTP, SSH, DNS).
*   **MAC Address:** Displays the MAC address of the host, often with the vendor name (e.g., VMware).
*   **Scan Summary:** Provides details on how many IP addresses were scanned and the total time taken for the scan.

## 3. GoWitness

*   (No descriptive information provided in the original text, only the tool name.)

NMAP
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a popular open -source tool used for network exploration and 
security auditing.
KEY FEATURES:
•Port scanning : Nmap can scan a network to identify open ports and the services running 
on them.
•Host discovery : Nmap can identify active hosts on a network by sending packets and 
analyzing the responses.
•Service detection : Nmap can identify the software and version numbers of services 
running on a network.
•OS detection : Nmap can identify the operating system running on a host.
•Scriptable interaction : Nmap can be used with scripts to automate tasks and extend its 
capabilities.
INSTALLATION:
Nmap is installed in the default Kali Linux but is also available in 
https://nmap.org/download.html
