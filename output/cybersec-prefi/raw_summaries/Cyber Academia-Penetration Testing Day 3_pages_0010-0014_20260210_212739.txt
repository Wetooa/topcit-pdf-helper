# Learning Guide: Application Security Testing

## 1. Vulnerability Scanning Output

Vulnerability scanning produces results that detail detected weaknesses in a system or application.
*(Note: The provided text refers to "Common vulnerabilities detected by scanning" and "Vulnerability Scanner sample results" but does not list specific examples within these pages. A scanner's output typically includes vulnerability names, severity levels, and potential remediation steps.)*

## 2. OWASP Testing Methodology

The OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) Web Application Security Testing method focuses on a **black box approach**.

*   **Black Box Approach:** The tester has little to no prior information about the application being tested.

### Testing Model Components:

*   **Tester:** The individual performing the security testing activities.
*   **Tools and Methodology:** The core techniques and instruments used during testing.
*   **Application:** The target system or software under examination (the "black box").

### Testing Categories:

Testing activities are categorized into two main types:

1.  **Passive Testing**
    *   **Goal:** Understand the application's logic and explore its functionality from a user's perspective.
    *   **Process:** The tester acts like a regular user, observing behavior.
    *   **Tools:** Can be used for gathering information (e.g., proxy tools to capture requests).
    *   **Outcome:** The tester gains a general understanding of the application's access points and features.

2.  **Active Testing**
    *   **Goal:** Actively probe the application for vulnerabilities using specific testing methodologies.
    *   **Process:** The tester applies a structured set of tests to identify weaknesses.
    *   **Categories:** Active testing is typically divided into 12 distinct areas:

        *   **Information Gathering:** Collecting data about the target application and its infrastructure.
        *   **Configuration and Deployment Management Testing:** Checking for insecure configurations or deployment issues.
        *   **Identity Management Testing:** Verifying how user identities are managed.
        *   **Authentication Testing:** Assessing the security of login mechanisms.
        *   **Authorization Testing:** Ensuring users can only access resources they are permitted to.
        *   **Session Management Testing:** Examining how user sessions are handled securely.
        *   **Input Validation Testing:** Checking how the application handles user-supplied data to prevent attacks.
        *   **Error Handling Testing:** Evaluating how the application manages and displays errors to prevent information leakage.
        *   **Cryptography Testing (Testing for Weak Cryptography):** Assessing the strength and correct implementation of cryptographic controls.
        *   **Business Logic Testing:** Probing for flaws in the application's unique business processes.
        *   **Client-side Testing:** Examining vulnerabilities related to client-side scripts and user interactions (e.g., XSS).
        *   **API Testing:** Testing the security of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

OWASP Testing Methodology
The OWASP Web Application Security Testing method is based 
on the black box approach. The tester knows nothing or has very 
little information about the application to be tested.
The testing model consists of:
Tester  – Who performs the testing activities 
Tools and Methodology – The core of this 
Testing Guide Project
Application  – The black box to test
TESTING MODEL

OWASP Testing Methodology
Testing can be categorized as passive or active:
PASSIVE
A tester  tries  to understand  the application’s  logic  and 
explores  the application  as a user. 
Tools  can be used  for information  gathering . 
At the end of this phase,  the tester  should  generally  
understand  all the access  points  and functionality  of 
the system
ACTIVE
During  active  testing,  a tester  begins  to use the methodologies  described  in the 
follow  sections .
The set of active  tests  have  been  split into 12 categories :
❑Information Gathering
❑Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
❑Identity Management Testing
❑Authentication Testing
❑Authorization Testing
❑Session Management Testing
❑Input Validation Testing
❑Error Handling
❑Cryptography
❑Business Logic Testing
❑Client -side Testing
❑API Testing
