## Learning Guide: Top Web Application Security Risks

This guide covers common web application security vulnerabilities, detailing what they are, common issues, and why they matter.

---

### A06:2025 – Insecure Design

*   **What it is:** Security weaknesses caused by poor design or architecture. Occurs when security is not considered early in the development process.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Missing threat modeling
    *   Weak or absent business logic controls
    *   Poor privilege management
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   Design flaws are difficult and costly to fix later in the development cycle.
    *   Even secure code can be vulnerable if the overall system design is insecure.
    *   Often leads to system-wide vulnerabilities, not just isolated bugs.

---

### A07:2025 – Authentication Failures

*   **What it is:** Weaknesses in how applications verify user identity, potentially allowing attackers to log in as other users.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Weak or reused passwords
    *   Missing or poorly implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    *   Session fixation or broken session handling mechanisms
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   Directly leads to account takeover.
    *   Often the initial step toward data breaches or privilege escalation.
    *   Easily exploited by automated attacks like credential stuffing.

---

### A08:2025 – Software or Data Integrity Failures

*   **What it is:** Occurs when applications trust software updates, code, or data without verifying their integrity. The system assumes data or software is safe when it is not.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Untrusted software updates or plugins
    *   Insecure Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
    *   Deserializing untrusted data without integrity or signature checks
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   Attackers can silently modify code or data.
    *   Can lead to malware injection, backdoors, or data tampering.
    *   Often affects multiple systems simultaneously.

---

### A09:2025 – Security Logging and Alerting Failures

*   **What it is:** Failures in logging, monitoring, or alerting on security-relevant events. Attacks can happen without anyone noticing in time.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Logs are unclear, incomplete, or inconsistent.
    *   Lack of real-time monitoring and alerts.
    *   Sensitive data is written directly into logs.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   Attacks can go undetected for extended periods.
    *   Delayed response increases the scope of damage and data loss.
    *   Makes incident response and forensic investigations difficult or impossible.

---

### A10:2025 – Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

*   **What it is:** Happens when applications do not properly handle errors or unexpected situations.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Error messages that expose sensitive system data.
    *   Applications crashing or behaving unpredictably during errors.
    *   Systems failing "open" (granting access/functionality) instead of "securely" (denying access/functionality) when an error occurs.
    *   Missing or improper error handling logic.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Displaying stack traces directly to users.
    *   Application crashing when required input is missing.
    *   Granting access to resources when an internal error occurs.

Insecure Design
•Security weaknesses caused bypoor design orarchitecture
•Happens when security isnotconsidered early inthedevelopment processWhat it is:
Common Issues:
•Missing threat modeling

•Poor privilege management
Why it matters:
•Design flaws arehard tofixlater
•Even secure code canfailiftheoverall design isinsecure
•Often leads tosystem -wide vulnerabilities, notjustisolated bugs

Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions
•Happens when applications don’t handle errors orunexpected situations properlyWhat it is:
Common Issues:
•Error messages that expose sensitive data
•Applications that crash orbehave unpredictably
•Systems that failopen instead offailing securely
•Missing orimproper error handling logic
Examples:
•Stack traces shown tousers
•App crashes when input ismissing
•Access granted when error occurs
