## Learning Guide: Vulnerability Scanning Basics

### 1. What is a Vulnerability Scanner?

A vulnerability scanner is a tool used to identify weaknesses and security flaws in systems and applications.

### 2. How Does a Vulnerability Scanner Work?

Vulnerability scanners use several methods to find security issues:

*   **Application Spidering and Crawling:** Explores web applications to map out all pages, links, and content, much like a search engine.
*   **Discovery of Default and Common Content:** Checks for default configurations, common files, and known content that might indicate vulnerabilities.
*   **Probing for Common Vulnerabilities:** Actively tests for well-known security weaknesses (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords, misconfigurations).

#### Types of Vulnerability Scans:

*   **Passive Scan:**
    *   **Method:** Non-intrusive checks.
    *   **Goal:** Observes targets to determine if they are vulnerable without directly interacting in a harmful way.
*   **Active Scan:**
    *   **Method:** A simulated attack on the target.
    *   **Goal:** Assesses vulnerabilities from an outsider's perspective to see how they would appear during a real attack.

### 3. Web Application Security Testing

*   **Focus:** Specifically evaluates the security of a **web application**.
*   **Process:** Involves an active analysis to find any weaknesses, technical flaws, or vulnerabilities unique to web applications.

### 4. Vulnerability Scanning: Output & Results

The output of a vulnerability scan typically includes:

*   A list of detected vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated software, security flaws).
*   Sample results and evidence for each identified vulnerability.

How does a Vulnerability Scanner work?
A passive scan performs non -intrusive checks, simply looking 
at targets to determine if they are vulnerable.
An active scan is a simulated attack on the target to assess 
vulnerabilities as they would appear to an outsider.

Web Application Security Testing
A web application security test focuses only on evaluating the 
security of a web application. 
The process involves an active analysis of the application for 
any weaknesses, technical flaws, or vulnerabilities.
