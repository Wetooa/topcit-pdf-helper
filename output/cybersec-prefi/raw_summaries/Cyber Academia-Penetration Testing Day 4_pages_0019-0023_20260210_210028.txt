## Learning Guide: Penetration Testing - Reporting Phase

### I. Rules of Engagement
These define the boundaries and expectations for a penetration test.
*   **Dos and Don’ts:** Specific guidelines for testers.
*   **Protecting Yourself:** Measures for the tester's safety and legal protection.
*   **Protecting The Client:** Ensuring the client's systems and data are handled responsibly.

### II. Pentesting Phases: Phase 6 - Reporting
*   **Reporting** is the final stage of a penetration test.

### III. Pentest Report Structure
A typical pentest report includes:
*   **Pentest Overview:** High-level summary for management and non-technical stakeholders.
*   **Pentest Technical Report:** Detailed findings, vulnerabilities, and technical remediation steps.
*   **Appendices:** Supporting documentation, including test cases, severity ratings, and testing evidence.

### IV. Pentest Overview Details
This section provides a summary and context for the entire engagement.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Background / Executive Summary:** Explains the purpose and scope of the test.
    *   **Tester and Application Details:** Information about the testing team and the systems/applications tested.
    *   **Pentest Findings Overview:** A brief summary of the main discoveries.

### V. Executive Summary (Background)
This part of the report provides a high-level overview of the penetration test.
*   **Purpose:** To explain why the test was conducted and what it aimed to achieve.
*   **Key Information:**
    *   **Contracting Party:** Who hired the penetration tester.
    *   **Objective:** To determine the client's exposure to a targeted attack.
    *   **Methodology:** Activities simulated a malicious actor conducting a targeted attack.
    *   **Primary Goals:**
        *   Identify if a remote attacker could penetrate the client's defenses.
        *   Determine the impact of a security breach on:
            *   Confidentiality of private company data.
            *   Internal infrastructure and availability of information systems.
    *   **Focus:** Identification and exploitation of weaknesses allowing unauthorized access to organizational data.
    *   **Access Level:** Attacks were conducted with the same level of access as a general internet user (external perspective).
    *   **Compliance:** The assessment adhered to recommended guidelines (e.g., OWASP, NIST) and was conducted under controlled conditions.

REPORTING: Background

Executive Summary

I ew "siw s was contracted by BeSETaE W to conduct a penetration test in order to
determine its exposure to a targeted attack. All activities were conducted in a manner that simulated a
malicious actor engaged in a targeted attack against ey = ‘= "ws with the goals of:

o ldentifying if a remote attacker could penetrate s g ww - defenses
o Determining the impact of a security breach on:
o Confidentiality of the company’s private data

o Internal infrastructure and availability of msg# =y - = y information systems

Efforts were placed on the identification and exploitation of security weaknesses that could allow a
remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to organizational data. The attacks were conducted with
the level of access that a general Internet user would have. The assessment was conducted in
accordance with the recommendations outlined in ™% == ¢ with all tests and actions being

conducted under controlled conditions.
