## Learning Guide: Pre-Engagement & Scope Definition for Penetration Testing

This guide summarizes key steps and information gathering essential before starting a penetration test.

### I. Pre-Engagement: Information Gathering

Before a penetration test begins, specific information must be collected to define the scope and execution plan.

#### A. Sample Scoping Questions: Network Pentest

When scoping a network penetration test, identify the following details about the target IP addresses:
*   **Total IP addresses** to be tested.
*   **Internal IP addresses** (if applicable).
*   **External IP addresses** (if applicable).

#### B. Sample Scoping Questions: Web Pentest

When scoping a web application penetration test, gather information about the applications:
*   **Number of web applications** to be assessed.
*   **Approximate number of static pages**.
*   **Approximate number of dynamic pages**.
*   **Number of user roles** within the application.

#### C. Pentest Information Sheet Essentials

A comprehensive Pentest Information Sheet should include:
*   **Target(s) to be tested:** Specific systems, applications, or networks.
*   **Test Schedule:** Start and end dates for the engagement.
*   **Test Credentials:** Any necessary login details or access keys.
*   **Specific Access Instructions:** Important notes or reminders for accessing the application/environment.
*   **Security Test Cases:** (If applicable) Any specific scenarios or tests requested.

Additionally, this sheet often includes:
*   **Target Metadata:** Details about the targets, such as their type, protocol specifications, implementation specifics, and underlying platforms.
*   **Engagement Data:** Administrative details like review type, specific engagement dates, names of consultants involved, and the estimated level of effort (e.g., person-days).

### II. Scope Definition

Defining the scope is a critical step in any penetration testing engagement.

#### A. Importance of a Clearly Defined Pen-testing Scope

*   A clear scope is **fundamental** for a successful and effective penetration test.
*   It ensures all parties understand **what is included and excluded** from the assessment.
*   Helps manage **expectations** and prevent misunderstandings.
*   Minimizes **risks** by clearly outlining authorized activities.

#### B. Key Considerations When Defining Scope

When defining the scope, consider:
*   **What assets** are in scope (e.g., specific IPs, applications, networks, systems).
*   **What assets** are explicitly out of scope.
*   **Types of tests** allowed (e.g., network, web, mobile, social engineering).
*   **Testing methodologies** to be used.
*   **Timeframes and schedules**.
*   **Authorized attack vectors** and prohibited actions.
*   **Reporting requirements**.
*   **Rules of Engagement** (see below).

#### C. Rules of Engagement

The Rules of Engagement (RoE) are a crucial part of scope definition, detailing the guidelines and boundaries for the penetration test. These specify how the test will be conducted, what is permissible, and what is not.
