## Learning Guide: Information Gathering & OSINT

### 1. Information Gathering

*   **Definition:** A phase in penetration testing (pentest) focused on collecting information about the target. This includes both publicly available data and internal information.
*   **Purpose & Importance:**
    *   Identifies potential **attack vectors**.
    *   Helps assess the target's **security posture**.
    *   Gathers valuable **intelligence** about the target.

### 2. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

*   **Definition:** A method of intelligence collection that involves:
    *   Finding, selecting, and acquiring information solely from **publicly available sources**.
    *   Analyzing this information to produce **actionable intelligence**.
