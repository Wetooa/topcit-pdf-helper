**Learning Guide: OWASP Top 10 (2025 Edition - A01 to A04)**

This guide summarizes the top application security risks, focusing on the first four items of the OWASP Top 10 (2025).

---

### **Overview: OWASP Top 10**
The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

---

### **A01: Broken Access Control (2025)**

*   **What it is:** Users can access data or perform actions they aren't authorized to. This happens due to missing or weak authorization checks.
*   **Why it's #1:** It remains the most common and impactful web application risk.
*   **Impact:** Often leads to data exposure, privilege escalation, or full account takeovers.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Accessing another user's private data by simply changing an ID in a URL.
    *   Performing administrative functions as a regular user.

---

### **A02: Security Misconfiguration (2025)**

*   **What it is:** Systems are configured incorrectly, or insecure default settings are left in place. This includes exposed services or a lack of security hardening.
*   **Why it moved up to #2:**
    *   More prevalent in modern applications due to increased complexity (cloud, containers, CI/CD pipelines).
    *   Small configuration errors can expose entire systems or sensitive data.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Leaving administrative consoles publicly accessible.
    *   Publicly exposed cloud storage buckets.
    *   Using default credentials that are easily guessable or publicly known.

---

### **A03: Software Supply Chain Failures (2025)**

*   **What it is:** Risks introduced through third-party components like libraries, dependencies, build tools, or CI/CD pipelines. This means trusting code that has been compromised.
*   **Why it's #3:**
    *   Modern applications heavily rely on external dependencies.
    *   A single compromised component can affect thousands of applications.
    *   While incidents are fewer, their impact is typically very high.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Using a compromised open-source library that contains malicious code.
    *   Malicious updates injected into build pipelines during software development.

---

### **A04: Cryptographic Failures (2025)**

*   **What it is:** Issues arising from missing, weak, or improperly implemented cryptography. This also includes poor encryption practices and exposed or mismanaged cryptographic keys.
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms.
    *   Insufficient randomness (poor entropy) in cryptographic operations.
    *   Predictable or broken random number generators.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Storing passwords without proper hashing.
    *   Using weak custom encryption instead of industry-standard algorithms.
    *   Poorly configured TLS/SSL (e.g., outdated protocols, weak cipher suites).

Broken Access Control
•Happens when users canaccess data oractions they shouldn't
•Caused bymissing orweak authorization checks
What it is:
Why it's #1
•Still themost common andmost impactful web apprisk
•Often leads todate exposure, privilege, escalation, orfullaccount takeover
Examples:
•Accessing another user's data bychanging anID
•Performing admin actions asanormal user

Security Misconfiguration
•Happens when systems areconfigured incorrectly orleftinsecure bydefault
•Often caused bydefault settings, exposed services, ormissing hardeningWhat it is:
Why it moved up to #2:
•Misconfigurations aremore common inmodern apps
•Cloud containers, andCI/CD increase configuration complexity
•Small mistakes canexpose entire systems orsensitive data
Examples:
•Open admin consoles
•Public cloud storage
•Default credentials

Software Supply Chain Failures
•Risks introduced through third -party libraries, dependencies, build tools, orCI/CD pipelines
•Youtrust thecode, butthecode wascompromisedWhat it is:
Why it's #3
•Apps rely onexternal dependencies
•One compromised component canaffect thousands ofapplications
•Fewer incidents, butvery high impact when ithappens
Examples:
•Compromised open -source libraries
•Malicious updates inbuild pipelines

Cryptographic Failures
•Failures related tomissing, weak, orimproperly implemented cryptography
•Includes poor encryption practices anexposed ormismanaged cryptographic keysWhat it is:
Common Causes:
•Weak oroutdated encryption algorithms
•Insufficient randomness (poor entropy)
•Predictable orbroken random generators
Examples:
•Storing passwords without hashing
•Using weak encryption orcustom crypto
•Poor TLS/SSL configuration
