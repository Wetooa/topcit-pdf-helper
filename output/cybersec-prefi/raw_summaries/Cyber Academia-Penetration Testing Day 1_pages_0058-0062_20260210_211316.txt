## Burp Suite Learning Guide

This guide condenses essential information about Burp Suite installation and configuration, designed for quick learning and studying.

---

### 1. Burp Suite: Installation

Burp Suite comes in two main versions:

*   **Burp Suite Professional:**
    *   Full suite of tools: Web Vulnerability scanning, Burp extensions, Intruder, etc.
    *   Includes all features of the Community version.
*   **Burp Suite Community:**
    *   Basic toolkit for manual testing.
    *   Includes modules like Repeater, Decoder, Sequencer, and Comparer.

**Installation Steps (Same for both versions):**

1.  **Download:** Get the executable installer from the official PortSwigger website: `https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload`
2.  **Run Installer:** Execute the downloaded file and follow the on-screen installation wizard instructions.

### 2. Burp Suite: Configuration

Burp Suite can be configured in various ways to suit different testing scenarios. There is no single "one-size-fits-all" setup; configurations must adapt to the specific requirements of each engagement.

#### 2.1 Standard Burp Setups

Burp can be configured for these common testing scenarios:

*   **Web Application Testing:** Setup with or without platform authentication.
*   **Web Services/API Testing:** Setup with or without mutual authentication/client certificates.
*   **Thick Client Application Testing:** Configured for proxying and intercepting HTTP traffic.

#### 2.2 Burp Projects (Professional Version Only)

*   Upon starting Burp Professional, create a new project.
*   This allows you to continuously save your work and return to it later.

#### 2.3 Settings Menu

*   **Core Function:** Burp Suite primarily acts as a **proxy** between your web browser and the target web server/API endpoint. This allows testers to view, intercept, and modify all requests and responses.
*   All relevant configuration options and settings are accessible within the **Settings Menu**.

#### 2.4 Scope

*   **Purpose:** After identifying your target web application, it's crucial to define its **scope** within Burp. This ensures only relevant traffic is captured, and unnecessary traffic is ignored.
*   **Benefits of Restricting Scope:**
    *   **Focused Traffic Inspection:** Helps testers inspect only the traffic between the client and the intended server, avoiding unrelated web applications or URLs.
    *   **Targeted Automated Scans:** Ensures that automated scans and payloads are only sent to the intended targets.
    *   **Efficient Spidering:** Guides Burp's automated spider mapping features to prevent recursive site discovery outside the target application.
*   **How to Set Scope:** You can restrict captured traffic to multiple hosts based on **Protocol**, **Port**, or **File** to ensure no important traffic within the target is missed.

Burp Suite: Installation

Types of Burp Suite Installations:
•Burp Suite offers Several versions of Burp Suite 
which include:
oBurp Suite Professional : contains the full 
suite of tools and features that PortSwigger  
has to offer which include Web Vulnerability 
scanning, Burp extensions, Intruder , etc. on 
top of the base features that Burp 
Community provides.
oBurp Suite Community : Basic toolkit 
containing the modules needed to perform 
manual testing such as Repeater, Decoder, 
Sequencer and Comparer modules
•Installation of either version is the same process. 
Steps involved in installing:
oDownload executable from the official 
PortSwigger  web site: 
https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydo
wnload
oRun the installer and follow through the 
installation wizard instructions.

Burp Suite: Configuration
Standard Burp Setups:
•Burp can be setup in various ways to enable the most efficient manual testing for 
different types of tests
•Due to the various environments, APIs, Technologies, Protocols, Network topologies, 
Frameworks, etc, A “one size fits all” configuration may not always be suitable for each 
engagement. It is the tester’s responsibility to understand the requirements of each web 
application test in order to  properly setup Burp to best carry out a penetration test
•Generally, Burp can be configured to handle the following testing scenarios:
oWeb Application test: can be setup with or without Platform Authentication.
oWeb Services/API Testing: can be setup with or without Mutual Authentication/Client 
Certificates.
oThick Client Application Testing : can be configured with proxying and intercepting 
HTTP Traffic. 
•The Succeeding slides will cover various features that are important to look into  or 
configure for your engagements.

Burp Projects:
•Upon starting Burp Professional, create a new project which enables 
you to continuously save your work that you can go back to at any 
time.

Burp Suite: Configuration
Settings Menu:
•One of Burp Suite’s main features is its capability as a proxy between a web browser 
and the target web server/API endpoint which allows testers to view, intercept and 
modify all requests and responses for testing.
•All relevant settings can be accessed within the settings menu.

Scope:
•Once a tester has identified the targets of the web 
application, it is of key importance to set these in 
the scope to ensure that only the relevant traffic 
needed for testing is captured by burp while 
unnecessary traffic is ignored.
oDue to the complexity of Web Applications, it is 
beneficial to restrict the scope for several 
reasons:
oTo assist the tester in carrying out the 
inspection of traffic sent between clients and 
the server only otherwise Burp may capture all 
traffic to other web applications or calls to 
URLs that should not be tested.
oTo ensure that automated scans only target 
and send payloads to the intended targets.
oTo help with focusing Burp’s automated spider 
mapping features to prevent recursive site 
discovery of a web application.
•Scope can be set to restrict captured traffic to 
multiple hosts based on Protocol, Port or File to 
ensure no important traffic is missed during testing.
