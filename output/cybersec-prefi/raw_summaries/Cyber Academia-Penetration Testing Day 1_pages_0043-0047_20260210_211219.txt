# Learning Guide: Penetration Testing Tools

This guide provides a concise overview of `TestSSL` and `SQLMap`, focusing on their purpose, usage, and installation.

---

## 1. TestSSL

`TestSSL` is a tool used for checking the security of TLS/SSL configurations.

### 1.1 Sample Command and Flags

To perform a basic security check on a domain using `TestSSL`:

```bash
testssl -p -s -S -U <domain>
```

**Flags Explained:**
*   `-p`: Checks for supported TLS/SSL protocols (e.g., TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3).
*   `-s`: Checks the strength and security of cipher suites used by the server.
*   `-S`: Checks server defaults and configurations for security best practices.
*   `-U`: Checks for common TLS-related vulnerabilities.

## 2. SQLMap

`SQLMap` is an open-source penetration testing tool designed to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 2.1 What is SQLMap?

*   An automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws in databases.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Detects and exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Enumerates databases, tables, and columns.
    *   Can access the underlying operating system.
    *   Detects and cracks password hashes.
*   Highly customizable with various configuration options.
*   **Important:** Effective use of `SQLMap` requires a good understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities and SQL databases.

### 2.2 Installation

#### Kali Linux
*   `SQLMap` usually comes **pre-installed** on Kali Linux. No separate installation is typically needed.

#### Windows
1.  **Download:** Get the latest version from the official GitHub repository: `https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap`.
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3.  **Navigate:** Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you extracted `SQLMap`.
4.  **Verify:** Run `python sqlmap.py --version` to confirm it's working. The version number should be displayed.

#### macOS
1.  **Install Homebrew:** Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
2.  **Install Python:** Using Homebrew, install Python:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
3.  **Install SQLMap:** Use pip to install `SQLMap`:
    ```bash
    pip install sqlmap
    ```

### 2.3 Sample Commands & Basic Usage

Here's a basic command to test a URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page?id=1" --dbs -p id
```

**Flags Explained:**
*   `-u "url"`: Specifies the target URL to test for vulnerabilities.
*   `--dbs`: If a parameter is vulnerable, this option will display a list of available databases on the server.
*   `-p <parameter>`: Specifies which specific parameter (e.g., `id`, `username`) in the URL to test for injection.

TestSSL
Sample command that you can use in  testssl  for penetration testing:
•Testssl  –p –s –S –U <domain>
-p : Check for TLS protocols
-s : Check for cipher suites strength
-S : Check for server defaults
-U : Check for TLS -related vulnerabilities

SQLMap


--- Page 45 ---
SQLMap
SQLMap  is an open -source 
penetration testing tool.
It automates the process of detecting 
and exploiting SQL injection flaws in 
a database.
It can detect and exploit SQL 
injection vulnerabilities, enumerate 
databases, tables, and columns, and 
access the operating system
It can also detect and crack password 
hashes.
It is highly customizable and has a 
variety of configuration options and 
settings.
SQLMap  requires knowledge of SQL 
injection vulnerabilities and SQL 
databases to be used effectively.

SQLMap
 : Installation
KALI LINUX
•Kali Linux ( SQLMap  usually comes pre -installed on Kali Linux, so you don't need to install it separately.) 
WINDOWS
•Download the latest version of SQLMap  from the official GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.
•Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.
•Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted SQLMap .
•To verify that SQLMap  is working correctly, run the command: `python sqlmap.py –version`
•If SQLMap  is working correctly, you should see the version number displayed in the command prompt.
MAC OS
•Install Homebrew by running the command: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)“`
•Install Python by running the command: brew `install python`
•Install SQLMap  by running the command: `pip install sqlmap `

SQLMap
Sample commands that you can use in SQLmap  for penetration testing:
•Basic usage: This command will test the URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities
•`sqlmap  –u “url" --dbs -p username `
o-u : URL that we will be testing. 
o--dbs : will display a list of database available on the server if a parameter is 
vulnerable
o-p : Specify which parameter to test
