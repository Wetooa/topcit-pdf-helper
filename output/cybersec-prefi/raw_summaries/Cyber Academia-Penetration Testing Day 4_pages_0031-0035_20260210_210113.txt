#### 1. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is a standard system used to assess the impact and severity of vulnerabilities. It provides a numerical score reflecting a vulnerability's severity.

*   **Purpose:** To capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score indicating its severity.

*   **Severity Levels and Base Scores:**
    *   **Low:** 0.1 – 3.9
    *   **Medium:** 4.0 – 6.9
    *   **High:** 7.0 – 8.9
    *   **Critical:** 9.0 – 10.0

#### 2. Test Cases

**Test Cases** are a list of attacks used to test the security of an application and find vulnerabilities. They are also used to test the functional requirements of an application.

*   **Purpose:** To systematically test application security and functionality to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

*   **Common Security Test Case Categories (Examples of Vulnerabilities/Attacks):**
    *   **Authentication and Session Management:** Checking for incorrect or missing controls.
    *   **Authorization:** Checking for incorrect or missing access controls.
    *   **Components with known vulnerabilities:** Identifying outdated or insecure third-party components.
    *   **Covert Channel:** Detecting hidden communication paths (e.g., Timing Attacks).
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Exploiting unauthorized commands from a trusted user.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Forcing a server to make requests to an arbitrary domain.
    *   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Allowing dangerous file types to be uploaded.
    *   **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards:** Manipulating redirects to malicious sites.
    *   **Cryptography:** Checking for incorrect or missing encryption implementations.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Testing the application's resilience to attacks that disrupt service.
    *   **Information Exposure:** Identifying unintended disclosure of sensitive data.
    *   **Injection Flaws:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (e.g., SQL, XML, Command, Path Injection).
    *   **Insecure Design:** Identifying fundamental flaws in the application's architecture.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object References:** Accessing objects directly without authorization checks.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting memory management errors (e.g., Buffer Overflows, Integer Overflows, Format String bugs).
    *   **Race Conditions:** Exploiting flaws in the timing or ordering of operations.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Identifying improperly configured security settings.
    *   **User Privacy:** Ensuring sensitive user data is handled securely and according to policy.

REPORTING: Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System (CVSS)
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System(CVSS) is used 
to assess the impact of vulnerabilities. There are 4 types 
of Severity as shown in the table below
Severity Base Score
Low 0.1 – 3.9 
Medium 4.0 - 6.9
High 7.0 – 8.9
Critical 9.0 – 10.0
