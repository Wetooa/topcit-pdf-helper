## SQLMap Learning Guide

**SQLMap** is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.

---

### 1. Installation

**A. Kali Linux**
*   SQLMap usually comes pre-installed. No separate installation is needed.

**B. Windows**
1.  **Download:** Get the latest version from the official GitHub repository: `https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap`
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3.  **Navigate:** Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you extracted SQLMap.
4.  **Verify:** Run `python sqlmap.py --version` to ensure it's working. You should see the version number.

**C. Mac OS**
1.  **Install Homebrew:** Open Terminal and run:
    `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2.  **Install Python:** Run:
    `brew install python`
3.  **Install SQLMap:** Run:
    `pip install sqlmap`

### 2. Basic Usage for Penetration Testing

SQLMap tests a given URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**A. Core Command Structure:**
`sqlmap -u "target_url" --dbs -p parameter_name`

**B. Command Breakdown:**
*   `-u "target_url"`: Specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) you want to test for vulnerabilities. Replace `"target_url"` with the actual URL.
*   `--dbs`: This flag tells SQLMap to display a list of available databases on the server if a parameter is found to be vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   `-p parameter_name`: Specifies a particular parameter (e.g., `username`, `id`, `search`) within the URL that SQLMap should test for vulnerabilities.

**Example Command:**
`sqlmap -u "http://example.com/login.php?id=1" --dbs -p id`
*This command targets `http://example.com/login.php?id=1` and specifically tests the `id` parameter.*

---

### 3. Expected Results

When SQLMap successfully identifies a SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **DBMS Detection:** It will first try to identify the back-end **DBMS** (Database Management System) being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
*   **Payload Application:** SQLMap then uses specific attack payloads tailored to that identified DBMS.
*   **Database Listing:** If the `--dbs` flag was used and successful, it will list the names of available databases on the server.
*   **Detailed Information:** The output will typically show detailed information about the server and discovered databases.

SQLMap
 : Installation
KALI LINUX
•Kali Linux ( SQLMap  usually comes pre -installed on Kali Linux, so you don't need to install it separately.) 
WINDOWS
•Download the latest version of SQLMap  from the official GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.
•Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.
•Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted SQLMap .
•To verify that SQLMap  is working correctly, run the command: `python sqlmap.py –version`
•If SQLMap  is working correctly, you should see the version number displayed in the command prompt.
MAC OS
•Install Homebrew by running the command: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)“`
•Install Python by running the command: brew `install python`
•Install SQLMap  by running the command: `pip install sqlmap `

SQLMap
Sample commands that you can use in SQLmap  for penetration testing:
•Basic usage: This command will test the URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities
•`sqlmap  –u “url" --dbs -p username `
o-u : URL that we will be testing. 
o--dbs : will display a list of database available on the server if a parameter is 
vulnerable
o-p : Specify which parameter to test

SQLMap
Results:
•We can see that SQLMap  guessed what  the back -end DBMS  is. It will now try to use 
specific payloads for this DBMS .
