## Web Application Security Testing: Active Testing Guide

This guide outlines various active testing techniques used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. Active testing involves directly interacting with the application to discover weaknesses.

---

### **Section 1: Information Gathering**

This phase focuses on understanding the application's structure and components.

*   **Identify Application Entry Points:**
    *   Analyze requests and responses to find all possible places where data can be input into or output from the application. These are potential injection points for attacks.
*   **Map Execution Paths:**
    *   Understand the main workflows and how users interact with the application from start to finish.
*   **Fingerprint Web Application Framework:**
    *   Identify the underlying technologies, frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Django), and server components used by the application.
*   **Map Application Architecture:**
    *   Create a logical diagram or understanding of the application's overall structure based on your research.

---

### **Section 2: Configuration and Deployment Management Testing**

This section covers testing for misconfigurations in the application's environment and deployment.

*   **Test Network Infrastructure Configuration:**
    *   Review network settings to ensure they are secure and not vulnerable.
    *   Verify that all used frameworks and systems are updated, secure, and do not use default settings or credentials.
*   **Test Application Platform Configuration:**
    *   Ensure default files, example code, and known vulnerable files have been removed from the production environment.
    *   Validate that no debugging code or extensions are present in production.
    *   Review application logging mechanisms for completeness and security.
*   **Review Old Backup & Unreferenced Files:**
    *   Search for and analyze hidden or forgotten files (e.g., old backups, temporary files) that might contain sensitive information.
*   **Test File Extension Handling:**
    *   **Dirbust:** Use tools to discover sensitive file extensions or files that might contain raw data (e.g., scripts, credentials).
    *   Validate that system framework rules cannot be bypassed to access these files.
*   **Enumerate Admin Interfaces:**
    *   Identify hidden administrator panels or functionalities.
*   **Test HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
    *   **HSTS:** A security mechanism that forces browsers to interact with a website only over HTTPS.
    *   Review the HSTS header implementation and its validity.
*   **Test File Permissions:**
    *   Identify any insecure or "rogue" file permissions that could grant unauthorized access.
*   **Test Cloud Storage:**
    *   Assess that access control configurations for cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) are properly secured.
*   **Test HTTP Methods:**
    *   Enumerate all supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    *   Test for access control bypass vulnerabilities using different methods.
    *   Test for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities (where malicious scripts are injected into web pages).
    *   Test for HTTP method overriding techniques.
*   **Test RIA Cross-Domain Policy:**
    *   **RIA (Rich Internet Application):** Web applications with desktop-like features.
    *   Review and validate policy files that allow RIAs to make requests across different domains, ensuring they are not overly permissive.
*   **Test for Subdomain Takeover:**
    *   Enumerate all possible domains (current and historical) to identify forgotten or misconfigured subdomains that an attacker could take over.

---

### **Section 3: Identity Management Testing**

This section focuses on how user identities, roles, and accounts are handled.

*   **Test Role Definitions:**
    *   Identify and document all user roles within the application (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
    *   Attempt to switch to or access functionality of another role without proper authorization.
    *   Review the granularity of permissions assigned to each role.
*   **Test User Registration Process:**
    *   Verify that identity requirements during registration align with security policies.
    *   Validate the entire registration workflow for weaknesses.
*   **Test Account Provisioning Process:**
    *   Determine which accounts have the authority to create other accounts and what types of accounts they can create.
*   **Test for Account Enumeration & Guessable User Accounts:**
    *   **Account Enumeration:** The ability to discover valid usernames or accounts.
    *   Review processes like registration and login.
    *   Analyze application responses (e.g., error messages) to see if they reveal whether a username exists or not.
*   **Test for Weak/Unenforced Username Policy:**
    *   Determine if a consistent account naming structure makes it easy for attackers to guess usernames.
    *   Check if error messages during login or password reset can be exploited for account enumeration.

---

### **Section 4: Authentication Testing**

This section covers testing the mechanisms used to verify user identities.

*   **Test for Credentials Transported Over Encrypted Channels:**
    *   Ensure that user credentials are *always* transmitted over an encrypted channel (like HTTPS) and never in plain text.
*   **Test for Default Credentials:**
    *   Check if the application or any of its components are still using default usernames and passwords.
    *   Review the creation of new user accounts for predictable patterns or default credentials.
*   **Test for Weak Lockout Mechanism:**
    *   Evaluate how effectively the account lockout mechanism prevents **brute-force attacks** (repeated guessing of passwords).
    *   Assess the security of the account unlock mechanism against unauthorized unlocking.
*   **Test for Bypassing Authentication Schema:**
    *   Ensure that authentication is strictly enforced across all services and functionalities that require it, preventing unauthorized access.
*   **Test for Vulnerable "Remember Password" Functionality:**
    *   Validate that "remember me" or similar features securely manage user sessions and do not expose credentials or session tokens to risk.
*   **Test for Browser Cache Weaknesses:**
    *   Review if the application stores sensitive information insecurely on the **client-side** (in the user's browser cache).
    *   Verify that cached sensitive data cannot be accessed without proper authorization.
