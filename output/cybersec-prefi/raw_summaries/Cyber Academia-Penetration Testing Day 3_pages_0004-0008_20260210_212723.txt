Learning Guide: **Pentest Engagement & Vulnerability Analysis**

---

### 1. Phases of a Pentest Engagement

A penetration test (pentest) typically follows these stages:

*   **Pre-engagement Interactions:** Initial planning and communication.
*   **Information Gathering:** Collecting data about the target.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying security weaknesses.
*   **Exploitation:** Attempting to compromise identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Post-Exploitation:** Maintaining access, escalating privileges, and achieving objectives.
*   **Reporting:** Documenting findings and recommendations.

### 2. Phase 3: Vulnerability Analysis

This phase focuses on identifying potential security weaknesses. A key component of this phase is vulnerability scanning.

### 3. Vulnerability Scanning

**What it is:**
*   Uses **automated tools** to check a target against a vast list of **known vulnerabilities**.
*   Purpose: To **identify potential weaknesses** in an application's security.

**Uses:**
*   As a **standalone assessment**.
*   As part of a **continuous security monitoring strategy**.

### 4. How a Vulnerability Scanner Works

Scanners use several techniques to find vulnerabilities:

*   **Application Spidering and Crawling:** Explores the application's structure, links, and content to map out all accessible pages and functionalities.
*   **Discovery of Default and Common Content:** Looks for default files, directories, or configurations that might indicate known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations (e.g., default login pages, common admin paths).
*   **Probing for Common Vulnerabilities:** Actively tests specific points in the application for well-known security flaws (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, outdated software versions).

#### Types of Scans:

*   **Passive Scan:**
    *   **Non-intrusive checks.**
    *   Simply **observes targets** to determine if they are vulnerable, without directly interacting in an aggressive way.
*   **Active Scan:**
    *   Performs a **simulated attack** on the target.
    *   **Assesses vulnerabilities** as they would appear to an outsider, actively testing for exploitability.

What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is the phase where automated tools are 
used to check a target against a huge list of known 
vulnerabilities to identify potential weaknesses in the security 
of the application.
Vulnerability scanning can be used as part of a standalone 
assessment, or as part of a continuous overall security 
monitoring strategy

How does a Vulnerability Scanner work?
A passive scan performs non -intrusive checks, simply looking 
at targets to determine if they are vulnerable.
An active scan is a simulated attack on the target to assess 
vulnerabilities as they would appear to an outsider.
