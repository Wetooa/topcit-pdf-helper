**Learning Guide: Post-Exploitation**

This guide outlines the essential objectives, phases, and techniques involved in the post-exploitation stage of a cyber attack.

---

### 1. Post-Exploitation Overview & Goals

**Definition:** Actions taken after an attacker has successfully gained initial access to a system.

**Overall Objectives:** An attacker aims to achieve the following:
*   **Maintain Persistence:** Ensure continued access to the system.
*   **Escalate Privileges:** Gain higher levels of access (e.g., administrator, root).
*   **Perform Reconnaissance:** Gather more information about the system and network.
*   **Move Laterally:** Access other systems or parts of the network.
*   **Exfiltrate Data:** Extract sensitive information from the system.
*   **Cover Tracks:** Hide evidence of their presence and actions.
*   **Utilize System:** Use the compromised system as a base for further attacks.

### 2. Post-Exploitation Phases

These are the typical sequential steps an attacker takes after initial compromise:

*   **Reconnaissance:**
    *   **Goal:** Gather more information about the compromised system and its environment (e.g., network topology, connected systems, user accounts).
*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Goal:** Gain higher levels of access within the system (e.g., move from a standard user account to an administrator or root account).
*   **Lateral Movement:**
    *   **Goal:** Access other systems or parts of the network from the initially compromised host. This expands the attacker's foothold.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**
    *   **Goal:** Extract sensitive or valuable information from the compromised system or network.
*   **Covering Tracks:**
    *   **Goal:** Remove or alter logs, delete files, or use other methods to hide their activities and avoid detection by security teams.

### 3. Common Post-Exploitation Techniques

These are the methods and tools attackers use to achieve their objectives and execute the post-exploitation phases:

*   **Command and Control (C2) Channels:** Establishing a covert communication link between the compromised system and an attacker's server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain elevated access.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Techniques to navigate and gain access to other systems on a network (e.g., using stolen credentials).
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Methods to transfer data out of the compromised network.
*   **Backdooring:** Installing persistent access points (backdoors) for future access.
*   **Password Cracking:** Attempting to decrypt or guess user passwords, often using collected hashes.
*   **Covering Tracks:** Actions to conceal malicious activities.
*   **File System Manipulation:** Modifying, creating, or deleting files to achieve objectives or hide presence.
*   **Network Traffic Manipulation:** Altering or intercepting network communications.
*   **Anti-Forensics:** Techniques specifically designed to hinder forensic analysis of a compromised system.

Phases
Reconnaissance : The tester gathers information about the system and its 
environment
Privilege escalation : The tester attempts to gain higher levels of access to the 
system
Lateral movement : The tester moves laterally, attempting to gain access to other 
parts of the network or other systems that are connected to the compromised 
system. 
Data exfiltration : The tester attempts to extract sensitive information from the 
system
Covering tracks : The tester attempts to cover their tracks to avoid detection by 
system administrators or security teams.
