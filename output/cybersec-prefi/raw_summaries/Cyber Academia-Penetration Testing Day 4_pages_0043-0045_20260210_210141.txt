### **Learning Guide: CVSS Base Metrics - Availability**

This guide focuses on understanding the **Availability** metric within CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Base Metrics.

---

#### **1. CVSS Base Metrics: Availability**

*   **Definition:** Availability measures the impact on a system component's ability to function or be accessible after a vulnerability has been successfully exploited.
*   **Core Focus:**
    *   It assesses the loss of access or operational capability of the **component itself**.
    *   This is about whether the service or system is *up and running* and *responsive*.
*   **Key Distinction from Other Metrics:**
    *   **Confidentiality & Integrity** metrics focus on the loss or corruption of **data** (e.g., files, information) used by a component.
    *   **Availability** focuses solely on the **component's functionality and accessibility**, not the data it handles.
*   **Examples of Impacted Components:**
    *   Networked services such as web servers, database systems, or email services.
    *   If a vulnerability makes a web server crash or unresponsive, that's an Availability impact.

CVSS Base Metrics 
 –
 
Availability
Availability : This metric measures the impact to the availability of the 
impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited 
vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply 
to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) 
used by the impacted component, this metric refers to the loss of 
availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked 
service (e.g., web, database, email)
