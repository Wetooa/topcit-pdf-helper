## Learning Guide: Active Testing

This guide focuses on essential security testing areas: Identity Management, Authentication, Authorization, and Session Management.

---

### 1. Identity Management Testing

**Goal:** Ensure user identities, roles, and registration processes are secure and properly managed.

*   **Test Role Definitions:**
    *   Identify and document all application roles.
    *   Attempt to switch, change, or access other roles.
    *   Review role granularity and permission logic.
*   **Test User Registration Process:**
    *   Verify identity requirements align with business and security needs.
    *   Validate the overall registration flow.
*   **Test Account Provisioning Process:**
    *   Determine which accounts can create other accounts and what types.
*   **Test for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Accounts:**
    *   Review processes like registration and login for user identification.
    *   Attempt to enumerate (discover) users by analyzing application responses (e.g., error messages).
*   **Test for Weak or Unenforced Username Policy:**
    *   Check if a consistent account naming structure allows account enumeration.
    *   Determine if error messages leak information that helps enumerate accounts.

---

### 2. Authentication Testing

**Goal:** Verify the security of user login, credential handling, and password-related functions.

*   **Test for Credentials Transported over an Encrypted Channel:**
    *   Check if credentials are exchanged without encryption at any point.
*   **Test for Default Credentials:**
    *   Look for and validate the existence of default credentials.
    *   Assess if new user accounts are created with defaults or predictable patterns.
*   **Test for Weak Lockout Mechanism:**
    *   Evaluate the account lockout mechanism's resistance to brute-force password guessing.
    *   Assess the unlock mechanism's resistance to unauthorized unlocking.
*   **Test for Bypassing Authentication Schema:**
    *   Ensure authentication is applied consistently across all services that require it.
*   **Test for Vulnerable "Remember Password" Functionality:**
    *   Validate secure management of generated sessions, ensuring user credentials are not exposed.
*   **Test for Browser Cache Weaknesses:**
    *   Review if the application stores sensitive information client-side.
    *   Check if cached information allows access without authorization.
*   **Test for Weak Password Policy:**
    *   Evaluate resistance to brute-force attacks (using dictionaries) by checking password length, complexity, reuse rules, and aging requirements.
*   **Test for Weak Security Question Answers:**
    *   Determine the complexity of security questions and assess if answers are easily guessable or brute-forceable.
*   **Test for Weak Password Change or Reset Functionalities:**
    *   Determine resistance to subverting the password change process (e.g., changing another user's password).
    *   Assess resistance of password reset functionality to guessing or bypassing.
*   **Test for Weaker Authentication in Alternative Channels:**
    *   Identify alternative authentication methods (e.g., mobile apps, APIs).
    *   Assess their security measures and look for bypasses.

---

### 3. Authorization Testing

**Goal:** Ensure users can only access resources and functions they are explicitly permitted to use.

*   **Testing Directory Traversal / File Include:**
    *   Identify injection points where directory paths might be manipulated.
    *   Attempt bypass techniques to access unauthorized files or directories.
*   **Testing for Bypassing Authorization Schema:**
    *   Assess if horizontal (accessing another user's data) or vertical (escalating privileges) access is possible.
*   **Testing for Privilege Escalation:**
    *   Identify points where privilege manipulation might occur.
    *   Fuzz (send varied, unexpected inputs) or attempt to bypass security measures to gain higher privileges.
*   **Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    *   Identify direct object references (e.g., `user_id=123`, `doc_id=XYZ`) in URLs or parameters.
    *   Assess if access controls are vulnerable to IDOR by changing these references to access unauthorized objects.

---

### 4. Session Management Testing

**Goal:** Verify the security of user sessions, ensuring they cannot be easily hijacked or manipulated.

*   **Testing for Session Management Schema:**
    *   Gather session tokens for the same user and different users.
    *   Analyze tokens for sufficient randomness to prevent session forging.
    *   Attempt to modify unsigned cookies containing manipulable information.
*   **Testing for Cookie Attributes:**
    *   Ensure proper security attributes are set for cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
*   **Testing for Session Fixation:**
    *   Analyze the authentication flow.
    *   Force a session cookie onto a user before they log in, then check if that same session ID is used post-authentication, allowing an attacker to hijack the session.
*   **Testing for Exposed Session Variables:**
    *   Ensure proper encryption of sensitive session data.
    *   Review caching configurations for session-related information.
    *   Assess the security of channels and methods used to transmit session variables.
*   **Testing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   Determine if it's possible to initiate requests on a user's behalf without their explicit consent (e.g., changing passwords or making purchases simply by visiting a malicious link).
