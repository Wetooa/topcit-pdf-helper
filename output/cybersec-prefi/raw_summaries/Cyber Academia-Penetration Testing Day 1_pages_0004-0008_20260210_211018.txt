## Learning Guide: Penetration Testing Basics

### 1. What is Penetration Testing?

*   **Definition:** Penetration testing (Pen Testing) involves simulating cyberattacks on computer systems and applications.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Identify:** Find weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploit:** Test if these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker.
    *   **Proactive:** Do this *before* malicious attackers can.
*   **Outcome:** Provides recommendations, based on identified risks, to improve security.

### 2. Why is Penetration Testing Important?

*   **Identify Risks:** Uncover weak points in your systems before attackers do.
*   **Meet Compliance:** Fulfill regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS) and avoid fines or audit failures.
*   **Improve Detection & Response:** Help security teams learn how real attacks occur, enhancing their ability to detect and respond effectively.
*   **Build Customer Trust:** Fewer security breaches lead to a stronger reputation and increased customer confidence.

### 3. Security Testing Overview

Penetration Testing is one level within a broader security testing framework. Other common types include:

*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifies potential weaknesses.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Actively attempts to exploit identified weaknesses.
*   **Red Teaming:** A more comprehensive, goal-based simulation of a real-world attack against an organization's overall security posture (people, processes, technology).

### 4. Types of Penetration Testing

Penetration tests can focus on different areas of an organization's IT infrastructure:

*   **Network Penetration Test:** Focuses on network infrastructure, devices, and associated services.
*   **Web Application Penetration Test:** Targets web applications, APIs, and their underlying components.
*   **Client-Side Penetration Test:** Examines vulnerabilities in client-side software, such as web browsers or desktop applications.
*   **Social Engineering Penetration Test:** Assesses human vulnerabilities through techniques like phishing, pretexting, or impersonation.

Involves simulating attacks on 
computer systems, and applications to 
IDENTIFY  and EXPLOIT  vulnerabilities 
before attackers do.
Identifies WEAKNESSES , 
MISCONFIGURATIONS , and 
VULNERABILITIES .
Provides RISK -BASED  
recommendations to improve security.

IDENTIFY RISKS
•Find weak points before attackers do.
MEET REGULATIONS & COMPLIANCE
•Avoid fines and failed audits (ex. PCI -DSS)
IMPROVE DETECTION & RESPONSE
•Teams learn how real attacks actually happen.
BUILD CUSTOMER TRUST
•Fewer breaches = stronger reputation
