# OWASP Web Application Testing Guide

This guide outlines the core methodologies for testing web applications, categorized into passive and active phases.

## 1. OWASP Testing Methodology Overview

Web application testing can be divided into two main categories:

### A. Passive Testing
*   **Goal:** Understand the application's logic and explore it as a typical user.
*   **Method:** Use tools for initial information gathering.
*   **Outcome:** Develop a general understanding of all system access points and functionality.

### B. Active Testing
*   **When:** Begins after the passive phase, involving direct interaction and manipulation.
*   **Focus:** Using specific methodologies to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Categories:** Active testing is split into 12 main areas:
    1.  Information Gathering
    2.  Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
    3.  Identity Management Testing
    4.  Authentication Testing
    5.  Authorization Testing
    6.  Session Management Testing
    7.  Input Validation Testing
    8.  Error Handling
    9.  Cryptography (Testing for Weak Cryptography)
    10. Business Logic Testing
    11. Client-side Testing
    12. API Testing

## 2. Active Testing: Detailed Modules

### A. Information Gathering

The goal of this phase is to collect as much information as possible about the target application and its environment.

*   **Conduct Search Engine Discovery Reconnaissance:**
    *   Identify sensitive design/configuration info leaked online (directly on organization's site or via third parties).
*   **Fingerprint Web Server:**
    *   Determine the web server's type and version to find known vulnerabilities.
*   **Review Webserver Metafiles for Information Leakage:**
    *   Identify hidden paths and functionality by analyzing metadata files (e.g., `robots.txt`, `.git` folders, configuration files).
    *   Extract other data for better system understanding.
*   **Enumerate Applications on Webserver:**
    *   List all applications within the testing scope present on the web server.
*   **Review Webpage Content for Information Leakage:**
    *   Check webpage comments and metadata for sensitive information.
    *   Gather and review JavaScript (JS) files for application understanding and leakage.
    *   Identify if source map files or other front-end debug files exist.
*   **Identify Application Entry Points:**
    *   Find potential entry and injection points by analyzing requests and responses.
*   **Map Execution Paths Through Application:**
    *   Understand the main workflows and application's internal logic.
*   **Fingerprint Web Application Framework:**
    *   Identify the specific frameworks and components used by the web application (e.g., React, Angular, specific server-side frameworks).
*   **Map Application Architecture:**
    *   Create a logical map or diagram of the application based on gathered research.

### B. Configuration and Deployment Management Testing

This phase focuses on identifying misconfigurations and insecure deployment practices.

*   **Test Network Infrastructure Configuration:**
    *   Review network configurations for vulnerabilities.
    *   Validate that used frameworks and systems are secure, updated, and don't use default settings or credentials.
*   **Test Application Platform Configuration:**
    *   Ensure default files and known vulnerable files have been removed from the production environment.
    *   Validate that no debugging code or extensions are left in production.
    *   Review the application's logging mechanisms.
*   **Review Old Backup and Unreferenced Files for Sensitive Information:**
    *   Find and analyze unreferenced files (e.g., old backups, temporary files) that might contain sensitive data.
*   **Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information:**
    *   **Dirbust:** (Scan for directories and files) to find sensitive file extensions or extensions that might contain raw data (e.g., scripts, raw data, credentials).
    *   Validate that no system framework bypasses exist for set rules (e.g., bypassing file upload restrictions).

OWASP Testing Methodology
Testing can be categorized as passive or active:
PASSIVE
A tester  tries  to understand  the application’s  logic  and 
explores  the application  as a user. 
Tools  can be used  for information  gathering . 
At the end of this phase,  the tester  should  generally  
understand  all the access  points  and functionality  of 
the system
ACTIVE
During  active  testing,  a tester  begins  to use the methodologies  described  in the 
follow  sections .
The set of active  tests  have  been  split into 12 categories :
❑Information Gathering
❑Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
❑Identity Management Testing
❑Authentication Testing
❑Authorization Testing
❑Session Management Testing
❑Input Validation Testing
❑Error Handling
❑Cryptography
❑Business Logic Testing
❑Client -side Testing
❑API Testing

Active Testing: Information Gathering
Conduct Search Engine 
Discovery Reconnaissance for 
Information Leakage
•Identify what sensitive design and 
configuration information of the 
application, system, or 
organization is exposed directly 
(on the organization’s website) or 
indirectly (via third -party 
services).
Fingerprint Web Server
•Determine the version and type 
of a running web server to enable 
further discovery of any known 
vulnerabilities.
Review Webserver Metafiles 
for Information Leakage
•Identify hidden or obfuscated 
paths and functionality through 
the analysis of metadata files.
• 
•Extract and map other 
information that could lead to 
better understanding of the 
systems at hand.
Enumerate Applications on 
Webserver
•Enumerate the applications 
within scope that exist on a web 
server.
Review Webpage Content for 
Information Leakage
•Review webpage comments and 
metadata to find any information 
leakage. 
•Gather JavaScript files and 
review the JS code to better 
understand the application and to 
find any information leakage. 
•Identify if source map files or 
other front -end debug files exist.

Active Testing : Information Gathering
Identify Application Entry 
Points
•Identify possible entry and 
injection points through 
request and response 
analysis.
Map Execution Paths Through 
Application
•Map the target application 
and understand the 
principal workflows.
Fingerprint Web Application 
Framework
•Fingerprint the 
components being used by 
the web applications.
Map Application Architecture
•Generate a map of the 
application at hand based 
on the research conducted.

Active Testing : Configuration and Deployment 
Management Testing
Test Network Infrastructure 
Configuration
•Review  the applications’  
configurations  set across  the 
network  and validate  that they  
are not vulnerable . 
•Validate  that used  frameworks  
and systems  are secure  and not 
susceptible  to known  
vulnerabilities  due to 
unmaintained  software  or 
default  settings  and credentials .
Test Application Platform 
Configuration
•Ensure  that defaults  and known  
files have  been  removed . 
•Validate  that no debugging  
code  or extensions  are left in 
the production  environments . 
•Review  the logging  mechanisms  
set in place  for the application .
Review Old Backup and 
Unreferenced Files for 
Sensitive Information
•Find and analyse  unreferenced  
files that might  contain  
sensitive  information .
Test File Extensions Handling 
for Sensitive Information
•Dirbust  sensitive  file extensions,  
or extensions  that might  
contain  raw data  (e.g. scripts,  
raw data,  credentials,  etc.). 
•Validate  that no system  
framework  bypasses  exist  on 
the rules  set.
