## Pentest Engagement Phases: A Learning Guide

This guide breaks down the typical stages of a penetration testing engagement, focusing on the crucial initial steps.

---

### 1. Overview of Pentest Engagement Phases

A penetration test typically follows these sequential phases:

*   **Pre-engagement:** Initial interactions, planning, and scope definition.
*   **Information Gathering:** Collecting data about the target.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying weaknesses in the target systems.
*   **Exploitation:** Attempting to compromise identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Post-Exploitation:** Actions taken after gaining access, such as maintaining access or escalating privileges.
*   **Reporting:** Documenting findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.

---

### 2. Phase 1: Pre-Engagement Interactions

This foundational phase sets the stage for the entire penetration test. It involves:

*   **Scoping:** Defining the exact boundaries and details of the test.
*   **Establishing Lines of Communication:** Setting up formal channels for interaction.
*   **Rules of Communication:** Defining how and when to communicate during the test.

#### 2.1. Scoping

**Definition:** Scoping is the process of precisely defining what will and will not be included in the penetration test.

**Importance:** It is one of the most critical components of a penetration test, ensuring all parties agree on the test's boundaries, objectives, and limitations.

**Scoping Process Steps:**

1.  **Set a Scoping Meeting:** Schedule a discussion with the client to understand their needs and systems.
2.  **Send Scoping Questionnaire:** Provide a detailed questionnaire to gather essential information about the target environment.
3.  **Generate a Pentest Information Sheet:** Create a summary document outlining all agreed-upon scope details based on the meeting and questionnaire.
