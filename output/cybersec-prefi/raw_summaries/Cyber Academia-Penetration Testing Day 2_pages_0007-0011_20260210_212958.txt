## Penetration Test Scoping: A Learning Guide

This guide summarizes the essential information about the pre-engagement scoping phase of a penetration test.

---

### 1. Introduction to Scoping

*   **Definition:** Scoping is the process of defining the boundaries and objectives of a penetration test.
*   **Importance:** It is one of the most critical components of a penetration test, ensuring a clear understanding of what will be tested.

---

### 2. Scoping Phases

The pre-engagement scoping process typically involves these steps:

1.  **Set a Scoping Meeting:** Initial discussion with the client.
2.  **Send Scoping Questionnaire:** A detailed form to gather necessary information.
3.  **Generate a Pentest Information Sheet:** A document summarizing the agreed-upon scope.

---

### 3. Scoping Questionnaires

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To gain a clear understanding of the client's needs and objectives.
    *   To accurately estimate the scope and effort required for the test.
*   **Variability:** The questions asked depend on the specific type of application(s) or systems being tested (e.g., network, web, mobile).

---

### 4. Sample Scoping Questions

Here are examples of questions asked during the scoping phase, categorized by test type:

#### A. Network Penetration Test Scoping Questions

*   How many **total IP addresses** are being tested?
*   How many **internal IP addresses** (if applicable)?
*   How many **external IP addresses** (if applicable)?

#### B. Web Penetration Test Scoping Questions

*   How many **web applications** are being assessed?
*   How many **static pages** are being assessed (approximate)?
*   How many **dynamic pages** are being assessed (approximate)?
*   How many **user roles** does the application have?
