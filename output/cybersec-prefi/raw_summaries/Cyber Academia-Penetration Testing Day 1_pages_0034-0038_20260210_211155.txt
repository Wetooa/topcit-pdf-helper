## Learning Guide: Penetration Testing Tools

This guide summarizes key penetration testing tools and their functions, derived from pages 34-38.

---

### **1. Introduction to Penetration Testing Tools**

Penetration testing involves using specialized tools to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications. This section covers some common examples.

---

### **2. Specific Tools**

#### **2.1. testssl/testssl.sh**

*   **Purpose:** Tests TLS/SSL encryption configurations.
*   **Functionality:** Can be used to check TLS/SSL encryption on any port across various systems.

#### **2.2. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**

*   **Definition:** An open-source tool specifically designed for **web application security testing**.
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   **Passive Scanning:** Automatically monitors and analyzes web requests.
    *   **File & Folder Discovery:** Uses dictionary lists to search for hidden or exposed files and folders on web servers.
    *   **Site Crawling:** Identifies a website's structure and retrieves all associated links (URLs).
    *   **Request Interception & Modification:** Allows users to view, change, and forward web requests exchanged between browsers and web applications. This is crucial for manipulating requests to test for vulnerabilities.

#### **2.3. OWASP ZAP: Installation**

*   **Availability:** Installers are provided for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Docker images are also available.
*   **Download:** Get the appropriate installer from `https://www.zaproxy.org/download/`.
*   **Prerequisite:** ZAP requires **Java 8+** to run. Ensure Java is installed and updated on your system.
*   **Important Ethical Note:** Before performing any penetration test, always obtain **explicit permission** from the web application owner. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
