## Active Testing Learning Guide

This guide focuses on essential testing methodologies across Authorization, Session Management, and Input Validation.

---

### Section 1: Authorization Testing

**Goal:** To ensure users can only access resources and perform actions for which they are explicitly authorized.

1.  **Directory Traversal**
    *   **Purpose:** Test for access to restricted files/directories.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify path traversal injection points (e.g., in URLs, file paths).
        *   Attempt to bypass security measures to determine the extent of access.

2.  **Bypassing Authorization Schema**
    *   **Purpose:** Discover if horizontal or vertical access is possible without proper authorization.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   **Horizontal Access:** Try to access data or functions of another user at the *same* privilege level.
        *   **Vertical Access:** Try to access data or functions restricted to *higher* privilege levels.

3.  **Privilege Escalation**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify ways to gain higher privileges than intended.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify injection points related to privilege manipulation.
        *   Fuzz (send varied, unexpected inputs) or attempt to bypass security measures that control privileges.

4.  **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine if direct references to objects (like user IDs, file names) can be manipulated to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify points where object references occur (e.g., `user?id=123`, `file?name=report.pdf`).
        *   Assess whether modifying these references allows access to unauthorized objects.

---

### Section 2: Session Management Testing

**Goal:** To ensure user sessions are securely managed, preventing hijacking, fixation, and unauthorized manipulation.

1.  **Session Management Schema**
    *   **Purpose:** Evaluate the randomness and security of session tokens.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Gather session tokens for the same user and different users.
        *   Analyze tokens for sufficient randomness to prevent guessing and session forging attacks.
        *   Modify unsigned cookies containing potentially manipulable information.

2.  **Cookie Attributes**
    *   **Purpose:** Verify secure configuration of cookies.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Ensure proper security flags are set (e.g., `HttpOnly` to prevent client-side script access, `Secure` for HTTPS-only transmission).

3.  **Session Fixation**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine if an attacker can "fixate" a user's session ID (force them to use a known session ID).
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Analyze the authentication flow.
        *   Attempt to force a specific session cookie on a user and assess if they can log in with it, thus fixating their session.

4.  **Exposed Session Variables**
    *   **Purpose:** Prevent sensitive session data from being exposed.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Ensure proper encryption is implemented for session variables.
        *   Review caching configurations to prevent session data leakage.
        *   Assess the security of communication channels and methods transmitting session data.

5.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine if requests can be initiated on a user's behalf without their knowledge.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Attempt to craft requests that a logged-in user's browser would automatically execute (e.g., form submissions, state-changing actions) when visiting a malicious site.

6.  **Logout Functionality**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensure proper session termination upon logout.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Assess the logout user interface (UI) and process.
        *   Verify that the session is properly killed/invalidated server-side after logout.

7.  **Session Timeout**
    *   **Purpose:** Confirm a mandatory session expiration.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Validate the existence and effectiveness of a hard (absolute) session timeout.

8.  **Session Hijacking**
    *   **Purpose:** Assess the risk of an attacker taking over a valid user session.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify and attempt to hijack vulnerable session cookies (e.g., via network sniffing, XSS).
        *   Assess the risk level if hijacking is successful.

9.  **Session Puzzling**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify and manipulate complex session logic or variables.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify all session variables.
        *   Attempt to break the logical flow of session generation or management by manipulating these variables.

### Section 3: Input Validation Testing

**Goal:** To ensure all user-supplied input is properly sanitized and validated before processing, preventing injection attacks.

1.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Purpose:** Detect scripts executing when user input is immediately reflected in the response (e.g., error messages).
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify variables reflected in HTTP responses.
        *   Assess what input they accept and any encoding applied upon return to the user's browser.

2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Purpose:** Detect scripts executing from user input that is stored (e.g., in a database) and later retrieved and displayed to other users.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify stored input (e.g., comments, profiles) reflected on the client-side.
        *   Assess input acceptance and any encoding applied when the stored data is displayed.

3.  **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**
    *   **Purpose:** Manipulate application logic by sending multiple HTTP parameters with the same name.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify the backend server and its parameter parsing method.
        *   Assess injection points and try to bypass input filters by duplicating parameters.

4.  **SQL Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject malicious SQL queries into user-controlled input to bypass authentication, extract data, or modify databases.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify SQL injection points (e.g., search fields, login forms).
        *   Assess the injection's severity and potential access level.

5.  **LDAP Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject malicious LDAP queries (similar to SQL injection but for LDAP directories).
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify LDAP injection points.
        *   Assess the injection's severity and potential impact on directory services.

6.  **XML Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject malicious XML code to manipulate XML parsers or extract data.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify XML injection points.
        *   Assess the types of exploits (e.g., XML External Entity - XXE) that can be achieved and their severities.

7.  **SSI Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject Server-Side Include (SSI) directives to execute commands or access files on the server.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify SSI injection points.
        *   Assess the injection's severity.

8.  **XPath Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject malicious XPath queries to bypass authentication or extract data from XML documents.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify XPath injection points.

9.  **IMAP/SMTP Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject malicious commands into email protocols (IMAP or SMTP).
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify IMAP/SMTP injection points.
        *   Understand the system's data flow and deployment structure.
        *   Assess the potential impacts of successful injection.

10. **Code Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject arbitrary code (e.g., PHP, Python, Java) into the application for execution.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify injection points where user input is directly evaluated or executed as code.
        *   Assess the injection's severity.

11. **Command Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Execute arbitrary operating system commands via user-supplied input.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Identify and assess command injection points (e.g., functions that execute system commands with user input).

12. **Format String Injection**
    *   **Purpose:** Inject format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`) into user-controlled fields to read/write memory or crash the application.
    *   **How to Test:**
        *   Determine if injecting format string conversion specifiers causes undesired behavior from the application.
