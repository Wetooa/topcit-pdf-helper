## Phase 4: Exploitation

### 1. What is Exploitation?
The **Exploitation phase** occurs after vulnerabilities have been identified. Its primary purpose is to:
*   Attempt to gain access to the target system.
*   Actively exploit the discovered vulnerabilities.
*   Simulate a real-world attack using specific tools.
*   Identify main entry points and high-value assets within the target.

### 2. Key Principles During Exploitation
*   **Scope Adherence:** All attacks executed must strictly stay within the predefined scope of the engagement.

### 3. Common Web Application Exploits
Pen testers often use these techniques against web applications:
*   **SQL Injection:** Used to extract sensitive information from databases.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Code Injection:** Inserts and executes malicious code on the server.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Gains unauthorized access by stealing a user's session.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Accesses restricted directories and retrieves sensitive files.

### 4. Important Considerations for Exploitation
*   **Exploit Compatibility:** Not all exploits work on all systems. Testers must be familiar with specific exploits for different target types.
*   **Exploit Effectiveness:** Some exploits are more effective than others. Choose the most appropriate one for the situation (e.g., XSS for web apps over Buffer Overflow).
*   **Setup Requirements:** Some exploits may require additional setup (e.g., changing firewall rules). Be aware of these requirements beforehand.
*   **Vulnerability Limitations:** Not every identified vulnerability can be successfully exploited against a target. Understand what each vulnerability *can* achieve (e.g., read common files vs. execute code).

Phase 4:
Exploitation

Exploitation phase comes after the vulnerabilities have been identified.
•In this phase, the pen tester attempts to access the target system and 
exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
•Testers use specific tools to simulate a real -world attack.
•The tester identifies the main entry point into the target to identify high 
value assets.

Exploitation
In any scenario, the attacks  should be based  on the scenario  
that is within  scope  of the engagement.

Attack against Web Applications:
•SQL Injection to extract sensitive information
•Cross -site Scripting to run malicious scripts
•Code Injection to run malicious code
•Session Hijacking to gain access to the target
•Directory Traversal to retrieve sensitive files

Things to remember in Exploitation
Not all exploits work on all systems
•Not every exploit will work on every system.
•Testers need to be familiar with the different types of exploits for specific targets.
Some exploits are more effective than others
•Testers should use the most appropriate one for the situation.
•For example, if you’re exploiting a web application, it’s more appropriate to use XSS 
exploit instead of Buffer Overflow.
Some exploits require more setup than others
•Some exploits may require additional setup to work properly (e.g., changing firewall 
rules).
•Testers should be aware of these requirements before attempting any exploit.
Not all identified vulnerabilities can be exploited against the target
•Testers need to be familiar with the different types of vulnerabilities and what they can 
do.
•For example, some vulnerabilities may only allow an attacker to read common files, while 
others may allow an attacker to execute code on a system.
