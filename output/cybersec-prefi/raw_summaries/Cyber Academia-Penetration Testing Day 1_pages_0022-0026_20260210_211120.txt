### **A03:2025 – Software Supply Chain Failures**

*   **What it is:** Risks introduced through third-party libraries, dependencies, build tools, or CI/CD pipelines. This means you trust the code, but the code itself was compromised.
*   **Why it's Critical:**
    *   Applications heavily rely on external components.
    *   One compromised component can affect thousands of applications.
    *   Fewer incidents, but extremely high impact when they occur.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Compromised open-source libraries.
    *   Malicious updates injected into build pipelines.

---

### **A04:2025 – Cryptographic Failures**

*   **What it is:** Problems related to missing, weak, or improperly implemented cryptography. This includes poor encryption practices or exposed/mismanaged cryptographic keys.
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   Weak or outdated encryption algorithms.
    *   Insufficient randomness (poor entropy) for cryptographic operations.
    *   Predictable or broken random number generators.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Storing passwords without proper hashing.
    *   Using weak custom encryption instead of standard, tested algorithms.
    *   Poor TLS/SSL configuration leading to insecure communication.

---

### **A05:2025 – Injection**

*   **What it is:** Occurs when untrusted user input is sent directly to an interpreter without proper validation, causing the application to execute attacker-controlled commands.
*   **Common Injection Types:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Manipulating database queries.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **Command Injection:** Executing arbitrary system commands.
*   **Why it's a Top Risk:**
    *   Very common and widely exploited.
    *   Often easy to exploit if input validation is missing.
    *   Can lead to data theft, account takeover, or full system compromise.

---

### **A06:2025 – Insecure Design**

*   **What it is:** Security weaknesses caused by fundamental flaws in the application's design or architecture, typically because security wasn't considered early in the development process.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Missing or inadequate threat modeling during design.
    *   Weak or absent business logic controls.
    *   Poor privilege management within the application.
*   **Why it's Critical:**
    *   Design flaws are significantly harder and more costly to fix later in the development cycle.
    *   Even securely written code can be vulnerable if the overall design is insecure.
    *   Often leads to system-wide vulnerabilities rather than isolated bugs.

---

### **A07:2025 – Authentication Failures**

*   **What it is:** Weaknesses in how applications verify user identity, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and log in as another user.
*   **Common Issues:**
    *   Weak or reused passwords.
    *   Missing or poorly implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Session fixation or broken session handling.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Directly leads to account takeover.
    *   Often the first step towards data breaches or privilege escalation.
    *   Easily exploited by automated attacks like credential stuffing.

Software Supply Chain Failures
•Risks introduced through third -party libraries, dependencies, build tools, orCI/CD pipelines
•Youtrust thecode, butthecode wascompromisedWhat it is:
Why it's #3
•Apps rely onexternal dependencies
•One compromised component canaffect thousands ofapplications
•Fewer incidents, butvery high impact when ithappens
Examples:
•Compromised open -source libraries
•Malicious updates inbuild pipelines

Cryptographic Failures
•Failures related tomissing, weak, orimproperly implemented cryptography
•Includes poor encryption practices anexposed ormismanaged cryptographic keysWhat it is:
Common Causes:
•Weak oroutdated encryption algorithms
•Insufficient randomness (poor entropy)
•Predictable orbroken random generators
Examples:
•Storing passwords without hashing
•Using weak encryption orcustom crypto
•Poor TLS/SSL configuration

Injection
•Happens when untrusted user input issent directly toaninterpreter
•Theapplication ends upexecuting attacked -controlled commandsWhat it is:
Common Injection Types:
•SQL Injection
•Cross -Site Scripting (XSS)
•Command Injection
Why it's still in the Top 5:
•Injection isvery common andwidely tested
•Often easy toexploit ifinput validation ismissing
•Canlead todata theft, account takeover, orfullsystem compromise

Insecure Design
•Security weaknesses caused bypoor design orarchitecture
•Happens when security isnotconsidered early inthedevelopment processWhat it is:
Common Issues:
•Missing threat modeling
•Weak ormissing business logic controls
•Poor privilege management
Why it matters:
•Design flaws arehard tofixlater
•Even secure code canfailiftheoverall design isinsecure
•Often leads tosystem -wide vulnerabilities, notjustisolated bugs
