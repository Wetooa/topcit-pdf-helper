## TestSSL Learning Guide

### 1. What is TestSSL?

*   **Definition:** A command-line tool for testing the SSL/TLS security of web servers.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identifies vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS configurations (e.g., weak ciphers, certificate issues, protocol flaws).
    *   Ensures web servers comply with industry standards and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

### 2. Installation

*   **Kali Linux:** TestSSL is *not* included by default in Kali Linux.
*   **Installation Command:**
    ```bash
    apt install testssl.sh
    ```

### 3. Key Usage & Commands

*   **Sample Command Structure:**
    ```bash
    testssl -p -s -S -U <domain>
    ```
*   **Command Flags Explained:**
    *   `-p`: Checks for supported TLS protocols.
    *   `-s`: Checks the strength of cipher suites.
    *   `-S`: Checks server defaults.
    *   `-U`: Checks for TLS-related vulnerabilities.
