## CVSS Base Metrics: A Learning Guide

This guide focuses on key CVSS Base Metrics, explaining their core meaning concisely.

### I. Scope

*   **Definition:** Measures if a vulnerability in one component impacts resources in components *beyond its security scope*.
*   **Simply Put:** Does the problem spread outside the immediate affected system/area?

### II. Confidentiality

*   **Definition:** Measures the impact on the confidentiality of information resources.
*   **Key Concept:** Preventing unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, information.
*   **Simply Put:** How much secret/private information could be exposed?

### III. Integrity

*   **Definition:** Measures the impact on the integrity of information.
*   **Key Concept:** Refers to the trustworthiness and veracity (accuracy/truthfulness) of information.
*   **Simply Put:** Could the information be changed or corrupted in an untrustworthy way?

### IV. Availability

*   **Definition:** Measures the impact on the availability of the *impacted component itself*.
*   **Key Distinction:** Unlike Confidentiality and Integrity (which concern data), Availability focuses on the operational status of the component.
*   **Examples:** Loss of a networked service (e.g., web server, database, email system).
*   **Simply Put:** Could the system or service be shut down or made inaccessible?

### V. Demo of Reporting

Scope
Scope : The Scope metric captures whether a 
vulnerability in one vulnerable component impacts 
resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality
Confidentiality : This metric measures the impact to the 
confidentiality of the information resources managed by a 
software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. 
Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure 
to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or 
disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity
Integrity : This metric measures the impact to integrity of a 
successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the 
trustworthiness and veracity of information

Availability
Availability : This metric measures the impact to the availability of the 
impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited 
vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply 
to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) 
used by the impacted component, this metric refers to the loss of 
availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked 
service (e.g., web, database, email)
