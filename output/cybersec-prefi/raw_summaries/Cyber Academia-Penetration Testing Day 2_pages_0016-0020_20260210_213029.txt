## Penetration Testing: Scope & Information Gathering

This guide simplifies key concepts for defining a penetration test's scope and the initial "Information Gathering" phase.

---

### 1. Defining Scope

**Scope** refers to the boundaries and objectives of a penetration test (pentest). It dictates what will be tested, how, and under what conditions.

#### 1.1 What to Consider When Defining Scope:

*   **System Types:** Identify if systems are on-premise, cloud-based, or a mix.
*   **Existing Defenses:** Analyze current security controls, known vulnerabilities, gaps, and incident response capabilities.
*   **Configurations:** Document system, network, and device configurations.
*   **System Tolerance:** Understand how systems, networks, and devices react under attack (tolerance levels).
*   **Attack Sophistication:** Determine the required depth and breadth of attack techniques.
*   **Risk Environment:** Assess the overall risk landscape where a threat actor might gain access.

#### 1.2 Rules of Engagement (RoE):

The RoE is a crucial, legally binding document signed by both parties. It formalizes the pentest and outlines all operational aspects.

**Key Elements of the RoE:**

*   **Written Agreement:** A formal contract signed by both the testing team and the organization being tested.
*   **Testing Methods:** Specify the techniques and tools approved for the engagement.
*   **Scope & Limitations:** Clearly define what is included, any out-of-scope items, and exclusions.
*   **Restrictions:** List prohibited actions or targets.
*   **Access Level:** Detail the testing team's access rights to systems and data.
*   **Communication & Escalation:** Define procedures for reporting issues, incidents, and client contact details. This includes how and when to notify the client's IT team and the schedule for status meetings and reports.
*   **Confidentiality & Data Protection:** Outline requirements for handling sensitive data and ensuring its privacy.
*   **Roles & Responsibilities:** Clearly assign duties for both the testing team and the client organization.

### 2. Penetration Testing Phases

#### 2.1 Phase 2: Information Gathering

**Information Gathering** is the initial pentest phase where publicly available and/or internal information about the target organization is systematically collected.

*   **Definition:** The process of collecting data about the target from various sources (e.g., public records, internet searches, internal documents, etc.).

#### 2.2 Purpose and Benefits of Information Gathering:

*   **Identify Attack Vectors:** Helps uncover potential paths or methods an attacker could use to compromise systems.
*   **Assess Security Posture:** Provides insights into the target's current security strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Collect Intelligence:** Gathers valuable background information and context to aid subsequent testing phases.

SCOPE: What to Consider When 
Defining Scope
The types of systems to be tested in terms of 
whether they are on premise or cloud
Existing defenses and security controls, including 
gaps, vulnerabilities, attack responses, and 
current security postures
System, network, and device configurations
System, network, and device tolerance levels 
during an attack
Depth and breadth of attack (i.e., sophistication 
level) in order to compromise systems
The entire risk landscape and overall environment 
in which a threat actor may gain access

SCOPE and the Rules of Engagement
Define the rules of engagement in a written agreement that 
is signed by both parties.
Outline the testing methods and techniques that will be used 
during the engagement.
Specify the scope of the engagement, including any 
limitations or exclusions.
Identify any testing restrictions, such as prohibited actions or 
targets.
Define the level of access that the testing team will have to 
systems and data.
Define the communication and escalation procedures in case 
of any issues or incidents.
Define the confidentiality and data protection requirements 
for the engagement.
Identify the roles and responsibilities of both parties, 
including the testing team and the organization being tested.
The type and scope of testing
Client contact details
Sensitive data handling
Client IT team notifications
Status meeting and reports
