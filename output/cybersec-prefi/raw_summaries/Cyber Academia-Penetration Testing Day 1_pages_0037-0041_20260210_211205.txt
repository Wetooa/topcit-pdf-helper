## OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)

### 1. Introduction
*   **What it is:** An open-source web application security testing tool.

### 2. Key Functions
*   **Passive Scanning:** Analyzes web requests without actively sending new ones.
*   **File/Folder Discovery:** Uses dictionaries to find hidden files and directories on web servers.
*   **Site Structure Mapping:** Uses crawlers (spiders) to identify a site's structure and retrieve all links/URLs.
*   **Request Interception:** Allows you to intercept, view, modify, and forward web requests between browsers and web applications.

### 3. Installation
*   **Availability:** Installers for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Docker images are also available.

*   **Important Note:** Always ensure you have explicit permission from the web application owner before performing any penetration testing.

### 4. Initial Configuration: Quick Start Auto Scan
*   **Purpose:** Quickly run an automated scan against a target URL.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Start ZAP.
    2.  Click the **Quick Launch** tab in the workspace window.
    3.  Click the **Auto Scan** button.
    4.  In the "Attack URL" text box, enter the full URL of the web application.

## TestSSL

### 1. Introduction
*   **What it is:** A command-line tool designed for testing the SSL/TLS security of web servers.

### 2. Key Uses & Purpose
*   **Vulnerability Identification:** Detects vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS configurations, such as:
    *   Weak ciphers
    *   Certificate issues
    *   Protocol vulnerabilities
*   **Compliance:** Helps ensure web servers comply with industry standards and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).
