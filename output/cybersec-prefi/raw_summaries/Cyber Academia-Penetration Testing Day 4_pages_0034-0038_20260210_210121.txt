## Learning Guide: Vulnerability Reporting & Scoring

### 1. Common Vulnerability Categories (Test Cases)

When reporting security findings, vulnerabilities are typically categorized as follows:

*   **Authentication & Session Management:**
    *   Incorrect implementation (e.g., weak credentials, improper session handling)
    *   Missing implementation (e.g., no authentication where required)
*   **Authorization:**
    *   Incorrect implementation (e.g., users accessing unauthorized resources)
    *   Missing implementation (e.g., no authorization checks)
*   **Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Using outdated or vulnerable software/libraries.
*   **Covert Channel:** Techniques like Timing Attacks that leak information indirectly.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Forcing authenticated users to execute unwanted actions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Forcing a server to make requests to internal or external systems.
*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Allowing attackers to upload dangerous file types.
*   **Unvalidated Redirects & Forwards:** Redirecting users to untrusted external sites.
*   **Cryptography:**
    *   Incorrect implementation (e.g., weak algorithms, improper key management)
    *   Missing implementation (e.g., sensitive data transmitted unencrypted)
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attacks designed to make a service unavailable.
*   **Information Exposure:** Leaking sensitive data (e.g., error messages revealing internal details).
*   **Injection Flaws:** Injecting untrusted data into commands/queries (e.g., SQL, XML, Command, Path).
*   **Insecure Design:** Fundamental design flaws leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** Directly accessing objects without proper authorization checks.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Issues like Buffer Overflows, Integer Overflows, or Format String bugs.
*   **Race Conditions:** Exploiting timing differences in system operations.
*   **Security Misconfiguration:** Improperly configured security settings on systems or applications.
*   **User Privacy:** Issues related to the handling and protection of user data.

### 2. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

*   **What it is:** A standardized system to objectively rate the severity of a vulnerability.
*   **Purpose:** Captures key characteristics of a vulnerability and produces a numerical score.

---

### 3. CVSS Base Metrics

These metrics describe the inherent characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time.

*   **Attack Vector (AV):**
    *   **Definition:** Describes *how* an attacker can exploit the vulnerability (e.g., network, adjacent network, local, physical access).
    *   **Impact:** The more remote an attacker can be (logically or physically) to exploit the vulnerability, the higher the score.
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):**
    *   **Definition:** Describes conditions *beyond the attacker's control* that must exist for successful exploitation.
    *   **Examples:** Specific system configurations, user interaction requirements, or certain network conditions.
*   **Privileges Required (PR):**
    *   **Definition:** Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess *before* successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
    *   **Examples:** None, Low, High (e.g., administrator access).

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System(CVSS) provides a 
way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability 
and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.


--- Page 36 ---
CVSS Base Metrics 
 –
 
Attack Vector
Attack Vector(AV) : This metric reflects the context by which 
vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and 
consequently the Base Score) will be larger the more remote 
(logically, and physically) an attacker can be to exploit the 
vulnerable component


--- Page 37 ---
CVSS Base Metrics 
 –
 
Attack Complexity
Attack Complexity(AC ): This metric describes the conditions 
beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to 
exploit the vulnerability.

CVSS Base Metrics 
 –
 
Attack Complexity
Privileges Required : This metric describes the level of 
privileges an attacker must possess before successfully 
exploiting the vulnerability
