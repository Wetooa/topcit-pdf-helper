## Learning Guide: Active Testing & Exploitation Phases

This guide covers key aspects of active testing, focusing on client-side vulnerabilities, error handling, API testing, and the subsequent exploitation phase in penetration testing.

---

### **Section 1: Active Testing – Client-Side Vulnerabilities**

This section details various client-side tests performed during active penetration testing.

**1. DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Goal:** Find XSS vulnerabilities rooted in the Document Object Model (DOM).
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify DOM sinks (places where user input is processed by JavaScript).
    *   Build and inject payloads specific to each identified sink type.

**2. JavaScript Execution**
*   **Goal:** Identify points where malicious JavaScript can be executed.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify sinks (code locations) and potential JavaScript injection points.

**3. HTML Injection**
*   **Goal:** Discover where attackers can inject malicious HTML.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify HTML injection points.
    *   Assess the severity and impact of the injected content.

**4. Client-Side URL Redirect**
*   **Goal:** Find vulnerabilities allowing an attacker to force a user to an arbitrary URL.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify injection points that handle URLs or file paths.
    *   Assess all possible locations the system can redirect to.

**5. CSS Injection**
*   **Goal:** Detect points where malicious CSS can be injected.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify CSS injection points.
    *   Assess the potential impact of such an injection.

**6. Client-Side Resource Manipulation**
*   **Goal:** Find ways to manipulate client-side resources through weak input validation.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify sinks with weak input validation.
    *   Assess the impact of potential resource manipulation.

**7. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
*   **Goal:** Ensure CORS configurations are secure and do not expose sensitive data.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify endpoints that implement CORS.
    *   Verify that the CORS configuration is secure or harmless.

**8. Cross-Site Flashing**
*   **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities in Flash applications that could lead to cross-site issues.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Decompile and analyze the application's Flash code.
    *   Assess sink inputs and usage of unsafe methods within the code.

**9. Clickjacking**
*   **Goal:** Determine if an attacker can trick users into clicking on hidden UI elements.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Understand the existing security measures (e.g., X-Frame-Options, Content Security Policy).
    *   Assess the strictness of these measures and if they can be bypassed.

**10. Web Sockets**
*   **Goal:** Evaluate the security of WebSocket implementations.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify if Web Sockets are used in the application.
    *   Assess their implementation using the same testing methodologies applied to normal HTTP channels.

**11. Web Messaging**
*   **Goal:** Secure communication between different origins using `postMessage()`.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Assess the security of the message's origin validation.
    *   Validate that safe methods are used and input is properly validated.

**12. Browser Storage**
*   **Goal:** Check for sensitive data storage in client-side mechanisms (e.g., Local Storage, Session Storage) and potential injection points.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Determine if sensitive data is stored in client-side storage.
    *   Examine code handling storage objects for injection possibilities (e.g., using invalidated input, vulnerable libraries).

**13. Cloud Storage**
*   **Goal:** Identify and assess potential leakage of sensitive data stored in cloud services accessible by the client.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Locate sensitive data across the system.
    *   Assess the leakage of this data using various techniques.

### **Section 2: Active Testing – Error Handling & API Testing**

This section covers testing for proper error handling and specific considerations for API testing, particularly GraphQL.

**1. Testing for Improper Error Handling**
*   **Goal:** Identify if error messages reveal sensitive information or create exploitable conditions.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Identify existing error output messages.
    *   Analyze the different types of output returned by the system during errors.

**2. API Testing: GraphQL**
*   **Goal:** Ensure GraphQL APIs are securely configured and protected against common attacks.
*   **How to Test:**
    *   Verify that a secure, production-ready configuration is deployed.
    *   Validate all input fields against generic attacks (e.g., injection, DoS).
    *   Ensure proper access controls are applied to all API operations and data.

---

### **Section 3: Phase 4: Exploitation**

This section describes the "Exploitation" phase in penetration testing.

*   **When it Occurs:** This phase begins **after** vulnerabilities have been successfully identified in previous testing stages.
*   **Pen Tester's Goal:** To gain access to the target system by leveraging the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Testers use specific tools and techniques to simulate real-world attacks.
    *   The primary objective is to identify the main entry point into the target system.
    *   Focus is placed on reaching and compromising high-value assets within the system.
