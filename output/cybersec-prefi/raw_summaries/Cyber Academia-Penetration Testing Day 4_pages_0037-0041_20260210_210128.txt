## CVSS Base Metrics: Key Concepts

The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Base Metrics describe the fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and user environments.

---

### 1. Attack Complexity (AC)

*   **Definition:** Describes conditions *beyond the attacker's control* that must exist for a vulnerability to be successfully exploited.
*   **Simply Put:** How difficult it is to set up the conditions for an attack.

### 2. Privileges Required (PR)

*   **Definition:** Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess *before* successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **Simply Put:** What kind of access (e.g., none, low-level user, admin) the attacker needs to have on the system *before* launching the exploit.

### 3. User Interaction (UI)

*   **Definition:** Captures whether a human user (other than the attacker) must participate for the successful compromise of the vulnerable component.
*   **Simply Put:** Does someone else need to click a link, open a file, or perform an action for the attack to work?

### 4. Scope (S)

*   **Definition:** Determines if a vulnerability in one component can impact resources in components *beyond its security scope*.
*   **Simply Put:** Does exploiting a flaw in one part of a system affect other, separate parts of the system or network?
    *   **Unchanged Scope:** The vulnerability only affects resources within the same security scope.
    *   **Changed Scope:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to impact a component or resources outside the original security scope.

### 5. Confidentiality (C)

*   **Definition:** Measures the impact on the confidentiality of information resources managed by a software component, due to a successful exploit.
*   **Confidentiality Explained:** The principle of limiting information access and disclosure only to authorized users, and preventing access or disclosure by unauthorized individuals.
*   **Simply Put:** How much sensitive information could be revealed or accessed by an unauthorized party if the vulnerability is exploited.

beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to 
exploit the vulnerability.

User Interaction : This metric captures the requirement for a 
human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the 
successful compromise of the vulnerable component.

Scope : The Scope metric captures whether a 
vulnerability in one vulnerable component impacts 
resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality
Confidentiality : This metric measures the impact to the 
confidentiality of the information resources managed by a 
software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. 
Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure 
to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or 
disclosure to, unauthorized ones.
