    *   **Steps:**
        *   Identify endpoints that implement CORS.
        *   Ensure the CORS configuration is secure and doesn't allow unintended access.
*   **Cross-Site Flashing**

    *   **Steps:**
        *   Assess the security of the message's origin validation.
        *   Validate that safe methods are used and input is properly validated.

        *   Examine the code handling storage objects for injection possibilities, invalid input, or vulnerable libraries.
*   **Cloud Storage**
    *   **Goal:** Identify and prevent the leakage of sensitive data stored in cloud services accessible from the client.
