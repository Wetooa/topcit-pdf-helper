# Cybersecurity Tool Learning Guide

This guide covers essential information on Nmap and GoWitness, focusing on their basic usage, purpose, and key output.

---

## 1. Nmap (Network Mapper)

**Purpose:**
*   A powerful tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
*   Helps identify live hosts, open ports, and services running on a target system.

**Basic Usage:**
*   To scan a single IP address:
    ```bash
    nmap <IP address>
    ```

**Key Information from Nmap Scan Output:**

*   **Host Status:** Indicates if the target host is `up` and shows network `latency` (delay in communication).
*   **Port Scan Results (`PORT STATE SERVICE` table):**
    *   **PORT:** The number of the port (e.g., `80`, `443`).
    *   **STATE:** Indicates if the port is `open` (meaning a service is actively listening on it). Closed ports are typically filtered out unless specified.
    *   **SERVICE:** The common service associated with that port (e.g., `http` for port 80, `https` for port 443, `msrpc`, `netbios-ssn`, `microsoft-ds`).
*   **MAC Address:** Physical address of the network interface card.
*   **Host Script Results:** Can show results from specific Nmap scripts run against the target. For example, `http-enum` is a script that enumerates details about web servers.
*   **Scan Summary:** Provides details like the number of IP addresses scanned and the total time taken.

**Example Output Insight:**
*   An `open` port signifies a potential entry point or a running service that could be further investigated for vulnerabilities.

## 2. GoWitness

**Definition:**
*   A specialized tool designed for **visual inspection** of websites across numerous hosts.

**Purpose:**
*   To quickly gain an **overview of the HTTP-based attack surface**.
    *   *HTTP-based attack surface*: Refers to all web applications, services, and endpoints exposed via HTTP/HTTPS that could potentially be targeted in an attack.
*   Helps in visually assessing the appearance and status of web services without manual browsing.

**Installation (Kali Linux):**
*   GoWitness can be installed via Kali's package manager:
    ```bash
    apt install gowitness
    ```

**Key Functionality and Output (Based on Screenshots):**

*   **Screenshot Capture:** Takes visual snapshots of target websites.
*   **Dashboard & Gallery:** Provides a graphical interface to view captured screenshots and scan results.
*   **Status Codes:** Displays HTTP response codes for each scanned URL (e.g., `200` for OK, `403` for Forbidden, `500` for Internal Server Error).
*   **URL Listing:** Shows a list of scanned URLs, their corresponding status codes, and the size of the web page.
*   **Filtering Options:** Allows users to filter results by status code (e.g., show only `200` responses or `Failed` probes).
*   **Visual Aid:** Helps identify live web applications, their content, and any immediate visual indicators of issues or interesting services.

**Practical Use:**
*   Ideal for quickly assessing a large number of web servers to prioritize targets for further, more in-depth web application security testing.
