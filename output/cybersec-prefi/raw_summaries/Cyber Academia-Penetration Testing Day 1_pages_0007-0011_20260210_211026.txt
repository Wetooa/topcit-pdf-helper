## Security Testing Learning Guide

This guide summarizes key concepts in security testing, focusing on different types of penetration testing.

---

### 1. Security Testing Perspectives

Security testing can be viewed through different lenses, often representing escalating levels of sophistication or scope:

*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifies potential security weaknesses.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Simulates attacks to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Red Teaming:** Conducts comprehensive, real-world adversary simulations against an organization.

---

### 2. Types of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is categorized by the specific area or system being tested:

*   **Network Penetration Test**
*   **Web Application Penetration Test**
*   **Client-Side Penetration Test**
*   **Social Engineering Penetration Test**

---

### 3. Network Penetration Testing

**Purpose:** Audits a network environment to identify security vulnerabilities.

**Types:**

*   **External:** Simulates attacks originating from outside the organization (e.g., internet-facing systems).
*   **Internal:** Simulates attacks from inside the network (e.g., by employees or a compromised internal device).

**What is Tested:**

*   Firewall Configuration
*   Firewall Bypass Techniques
*   Stateful Inspection Analysis
*   Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Deception
*   DNS-Level Attacks

---

### 4. Web Application Penetration Testing

**Purpose:** Audits web applications for security problems stemming from insecure design, development, or coding practices.

**Focuses On:**

*   Websites
*   Web Applications
*   Browsers
*   Plugins

---

### 5. Client-Side Penetration Testing

**Purpose:** Audits client-side applications for security weaknesses.

**Common Targets/Examples:**

*   Putty (SSH client)
*   Email Clients
*   Web Browsers
*   Third-party plugins and libraries (used by client applications)
