## 1. Information Security Standards & Classifications

This section introduces important frameworks and systems used to manage, categorize, and assess information security vulnerabilities and controls.

### A) ISO 27001:2013 2.0
*   **Purpose**: An international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certifications.
*   **Update**: The 2013 version updated the control checklist from 133 items across 12 fields to **114 items across 14 fields**.
*   **Key Control Fields (Examples)**:
    *   Information security policy
    *   Information security organization
    *   Asset management
    *   Personnel security
    *   Physical and environmental security
    *   Communication security
    *   Access control
    *   Acquiring, developing, and maintaining information systems
    *   Managing information security incidents
    *   Managing business continuity
    *   Compliance
    *   Supplier relationship
    *   Password control
    *   Operational security
    *   *(Each field contains a specific number of control items, totaling 114.)*

### B) OWASP Top 10 (Open Web Application Security Project)
*   **Purpose**: A list of the **10 most critical web application security risks**. It serves as a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.
*   **Basis**: Compiled from extensive data (40+ sets) from application security companies and surveys (500+ professionals), covering vulnerabilities from hundreds of organizations and over 100,000 real-world applications/APIs.
*   **Ranking**: Items are selected and ranked based on prevalence, possibility of attack, detectability, and impact level.
*   **Key Changes (OWASP Top 10: 2013 vs. 2017)**:
    *   **New in 2017**:
        *   A4: XML External Entities (XXE)
        *   A8: Insecure Deserialization
        *   A10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
    *   **Merged/Renamed**:
        *   A2 (2013): Broken Authentication and Session Management → A2 (2017): Broken Authentication
        *   A4 (2013): Insecure Direct Object References → *Merged into* A5 (2017): Broken Access Control
        *   A7 (2013): Missing Function Level Access Control → *Merged into* A5 (2017): Broken Access Control
        *   A9 (2013): Using Known Vulnerable Components → A9 (2017): Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
    *   **Moved in Ranking**:
        *   A3 (2013): Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) → A7 (2017)
        *   A5 (2013): Security Misconfiguration → A6 (2017)
        *   A6 (2013): Sensitive Data Exposure → A3 (2017)
    *   **Removed from Top 10 (2017)**:
        *   A8 (2013): Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
        *   A10 (2013): Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

### C) CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
*   **Definition**: A **classification system for software weaknesses**. It categorizes software flaws based on view, category, vulnerability, and complex elements.
*   **Managed by**: MITRE (with U.S. Department of Homeland Security support).

### D) CWSS (Common Weakness Scoring System)
*   **Definition**: A scoring system for determining the **relative importance of software vulnerabilities**.
*   **Application**: Used to assess vulnerabilities in software architecture, design, code, or implementation.

### E) CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
*   **Definition**: A **list of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities**. It acts as a historical record of discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Identification**: Each vulnerability is assigned a unique ID in the format "CVE-Year-Sequence" (e.g., CVE-2023-12345).
*   **Distinction**: Unlike CWE (which classifies *types* of weaknesses), CVE lists *specific instances* of vulnerabilities.

### F) CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
*   **Definition**: An open framework used to **assess and identify the severity of security vulnerabilities**.
*   **Metric Groups**: Consists of three groups to calculate an overall score and priority:
    1.  **Basic Metrics**: Inherent characteristics of the vulnerability.
    2.  **Temporary Metrics**: Characteristics that can change over time.
    3.  **Environmental Metrics**: Characteristics specific to a user's environment.

### G) SANS Top 25 (SysAdmin, Audit, Networking, and Security)
*   **Definition**: A list of the **25 most serious programming errors** that commonly cause software vulnerabilities.
*   **Categories**: Errors are grouped into categories, such as unsafe resource management and inappropriate security countermeasures.
*   **Basis**: Developed by MITRE and SANS, building upon the CWE classification.

## 2. Secure Application Development

This section emphasizes the critical role of secure coding practices and integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle.

### A) Recent Trends & Importance
*   **Core Issue**: The majority of cyber-attacks exploit software security vulnerabilities.
*   **Conclusion**: **Application security and secure coding are paramount** for developing applications safely and securely.

### B) Learning Objectives (What You Will Learn)
*   Explain common security weaknesses and vulnerabilities found in software.
*   Understand the concepts, techniques, and lifecycle of secure coding.
*   Describe secure coding practices relevant to major programming languages and mobile environments.

### C) Key Terms
*   **Secure Coding**: Writing software code in a way that prevents security vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Weakness**: A flaw or defect in software that could lead to a vulnerability.
*   **Security Vulnerability**: A specific weakness that can be exploited by an attacker.
*   **Secure SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**: Integrating security activities and considerations into every phase of the software development process.

### D) Practical Application: Secure SDLC
*   **Scenario**: A company aims to build a highly secure website by implementing secure coding practices throughout its development lifecycle.
*   **Key Steps for Secure Development**:
    1.  **Apply Secure SDLC**: Integrate security from the project's inception.
    2.  **Requirement Definition**: Include secure coding requirements at the very start.
    3.  **Design Analysis**: Implement secure design principles from an architectural perspective.
    4.  **Development Phase**: Developers actively review their code for security flaws.
    5.  **Quality Control**: Perform third-party security checks.
    6.  **Operation & Maintenance**: Utilize secure coding diagnostic tools for ongoing monitoring and review.
*   **Common Challenge**: Developers often struggle due to a lack of understanding and training regarding secure coding and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Recommendation**: To build robust and secure applications, secure coding must be consistently applied **across the entire development lifecycle**.

C) CWE(Common  Weakness  Enumeration)
CWE is a classification  system  that MITRE, which is an affiliate of the U.S. Department  of Defense  with the
support  of the National  Cyber Security  Division  within the Department  of Homeland  Security,  classifies
software  weakness  items, based on the view, category, vulnerability,  and complex  elements.  (http://cwe.mitre.
org)
D) CWSS (Common  Weakness  Scoring  System)
CWSS is a scoring system for determining  the relative importance  of various vulnerabilities  in architecture,
design, code, or implementation  in software,  which can be important  security  issues of software.
E) CVE (Common  Vulnerabilities  and Exposures)
While CWE is a classification  system for common  vulnerabilities,  CVE is a list of security  vulnerabilities
discovered  over time. It can be seen as a record history of discovered  security  vulnerabilities,  managed  by the
identification system  of “CVE-Year-Sequence’”.
F) CVSS (Common  Vulnerabilities  Scoring  System)
CVSS is an open framework  used to assess and identify security vulnerabilities.  It consists  of three metric
groups: basic metric group, temporary  metric group, and environmental  metric group. The result, calculated  by
the three metric  groups,  becomes  the overall score of the vulnerability  and the priority  of the vulnerability.
