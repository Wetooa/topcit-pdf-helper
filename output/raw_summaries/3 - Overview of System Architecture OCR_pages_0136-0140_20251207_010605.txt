### I. Virtualization Technologies

#### A. OS-Level Virtualization (Container Technology)

1.  **Definition**:
    *   A virtualization technology that makes a system appear to be running another OS on top of the host OS.
    *   Uses the virtualization features built into the **host OS**, not a hypervisor.
    *   **Container technology** allocates and isolates resources within the OS.

2.  **How it Works**:
    *   Containers share the **same host OS kernel**.
    *   Each container is allocated resources (memory, storage, network) and operates independently.
    *   The guest OS **must be the same** as the host OS.

3.  **Characteristics**:
    *   **Lighter** and more **portable** than traditional virtualization.
    *   In Linux containers (LXC), user space is partitioned, limiting resources for each user process, while sharing the kernel space.

4.  **Examples**:
    *   Solaris Containers
    *   FreeBSD Jails
    *   Linux Docker

5.  **Advantages**:
    *   **Quick Start/Finish**: Very fast compared to hypervisor-based virtualization.
    *   **High Density**: Minimal resource consumption; one OS can run many containers.
    *   **Low Overhead**: User space isolated without full system emulation.
    *   **Application Container Support**: Supports specific application configurations.

6.  **Disadvantages**:
    *   **Host OS-Dependent**: Containers are tied to the host OS.
    *   **Kernel Configuration Limited**: Cannot configure a unique kernel for each container.

7.  **Comparison: Hypervisor vs. OS-Level Virtualization**

| Feature              | Hypervisor Virtualization                    | OS-Level Virtualization              |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Use**     | Fully independent VMs                        | Uses host OS directly                |
| **OS Independence**  | Guest OS fully independent of host OS        | Guest OS must be same as host OS     |
| **Performance**      | High overhead (but hardware virtualization improves) | Low overhead                         |
| **Management**       | Separately managed for each VM               | Centralized management of common software |
| **Heterogeneity**    | Heterogeneous integration (e.g., Linux & Windows mixed) | Resource integration in a single OS environment |
| **Technologies**     | Xen, MS Virtual Server, KVM                  | Solaris, LXC, Docker                 |

#### B. Storage Virtualization

*   **Definition**: Provides an environment to use heterogeneous storage systems by virtually allocating only the minimum required space (using **thin-provisioning**) instead of configuring all required storage upfront.

#### C. Network Virtualization

*   **Definition**: Implements network devices (L2/L3/L7 switches, firewalls, security devices) as **virtual machines**.
*   Allows network resources to operate separately through internal virtualization, even within a shared physical environment.

---

### II. Cloud Platforms & Technologies

#### A. Cloud Platform Definition

*   A cloud operating system that collects, controls, and operates resources like servers, storage, networks, and virtualization technologies.

#### B. Openstack

1.  **Definition**:
    *   An **open-source project** developing software blocks for building public and private cloud computing platforms.
    *   Refers to the community (developers, enterprises, users) aiming to implement and operate open-source cloud computing.
    *   Establishes industry standards for cloud platforms, independent of equipment type or vendor.

2.  **Main Openstack Projects (Components)**:
    *   **Nova**: Core component for automatic control and operation of large-scale virtual computer instances.
    *   **Swift**: Implements large-scale, reliable cloud **object storage** services.

@ OS-level  virtualization
It is a virtualization  technology  that makes the system look like it’s using another  OS on the OS. It uses the
virtualization  technology  included in the OS, instead of a hypervisor.  The container  technology  that allocates  and
isolates  the resources  included  in the OS has gained interest.  The leading  OS-level  virtualization  technologies  include
Solaris Containers,  FreeBSD  Jails, and Linux Docker. The guest OS must be the same as the host OS, since it uses
the OS's container  function, instead of a hypervisor.  Containers  on the OS are allocated  resources,  such as memory,
storage,  and network,  which are independently  operated  between  containers.

Container Container
[Figure  99] OS-Level  Virtualization
Container  virtualization  technology  can be characterized  as being lighter and more portable  than existing
virtualization  technologies.  In Linux containers  (LXC), there is kernel space for managing  physical resources,  and a
user space for executing  user processes  inside the OS. The container  virtualization  technology  partitions  the user
space into ten and limits the resources  visible in each user process.

04 Storage  and Network  Virtualization  Technologies
A) Storage  virtualization
It enables  service  implementation  by virtually  allocating  only the minimum  space initially required,  with thin-
provisioning  technology,  instead of configuring  the required  storage space. Moreover,  it provides  an environment  to
use heterogeneous  storage  system integration.
B) Network  virtualization
It implements  L2, L3, and L7 switches,  network  firewalls,  and security  devices  that existed in the form of hardware
appliances  as virtual machines.  It enables  networking  resources  to operate  separately  through  internal virtualization,
even in a shared physical  environment.
05 Cloud Platform
A) Definition  of cloud platform
A cloud platform is a cloud operation system to collect, control, and operate resources,  such as servers,  storage,
networks,  and virtualization  technologies.
B) Openstack
Openstack  is an open-source  project that develops  all software  blocks needed to build public and private cloud
computing  platforms.  It also refers to the community  of open-source  developers,  enterprises, and users that want to
implement  and operate  cloud computing  with open source. Moreover,  Openstack  establishes  industry  standards  for
cloud computing  platforms,  independent  of the equipment  type or vendor's  implementation  technology.
