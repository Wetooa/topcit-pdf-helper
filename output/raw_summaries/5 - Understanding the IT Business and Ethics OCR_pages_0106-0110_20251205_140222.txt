### 1. ITIL v3 Process Overview

ITIL v3 (Information Technology Infrastructure Library Version 3) is a framework that evolved from ITIL v2 to provide a business value model for IT service management. It supports IT governance and extends service management across all business areas.

**Key Features of ITIL v3:**
*   **Lifecycle Approach:** Follows a continuous improvement cycle.
*   **Business Value-Centered:** Focuses on delivering value to the business.
*   **Strengthens Performance Evaluation (ROI):** Addresses a deficiency in v2.
*   **Incorporates ISO/IEC 20000 Requirements.**
*   **Uses PDCA Model:** Plan-Do-Check-Action for continuous improvement.

**The 5 Core ITIL v3 Process Areas (Lifecycle):**

1.  **Service Strategy:**
    *   **Purpose:** Define IT service strategy, align with business goals.
    *   **Key Activities:** Planning IT services, organization/relationship specification, IT investment management, understanding customers, setting competitive priorities, HR management, compliance.

2.  **Service Design:**
    *   **Purpose:** Design new or changed services to meet business requirements.
    *   **Key Activities:** Requirement analysis, negotiation/contract drafting, service solution design, evaluating alternatives, procuring preferred solutions, designing applications, systems, and processes.

3.  **Service Transition:**
    *   **Purpose:** Build, test, and deploy services into the live environment.
    *   **Key Activities:** Release planning/preparation, build/test/pilot services, establish transition plans, transition/adoption/disposal, review and termination, service verification.

4.  **Service Operation:**
    *   **Purpose:** Deliver and support services effectively and efficiently.
    *   **Key Activities:** Customer request processing, communication management, event/incident/problem management, service level metrics management, safety/accessibility management.

5.  **Continual Service Improvement (CSI):**
    *   **Purpose:** Improve IT services and processes over time.
    *   **Key Activities:** Participating in strategy/design/implementation phases, service report analysis, trend identification, establishing performance baselines, operating improvement programs, feedback across all lifecycle phases.

### 3. Understanding Service Level Agreement (SLA) & Related Concepts

**SLA (Service Level Agreement):**
*   An agreement between an IT service provider and its customers.
*   Defines the scope, items, form, performance, measurement methods, and price of the provided service.
*   Crucial for managing expectations and preventing conflicts.

**SLM (Service Level Management):**
*   The framework for continuously monitoring, changing, and managing SLAs.
*   Ensures agreed service quality and works to improve service levels and customer confidence.

**SOW (Statement of Work):**
*   A work statement that specifies the detailed requirements of a service or work described in the SLA or for a project.

**Effects of SLA Deployment:**
*   **Seamless Communication:** Facilitates dialogue between consumers and suppliers.
*   **Prevention of Conflicts:** Narrows expectation gaps and provides a basis for resolution.
*   **Objective Evaluation:** Enables quantitative assessment of service quality.
*   **Continuous Control:** Establishes a system for managing and controlling services.

### 4. Component Elements of an SLA & Metrics

An SLA sets target levels, provides measurement standards, and defines reporting for service levels.

**SLA Component Elements:**

1.  **Service Level Metrics:** Quantitatively judge service levels for each service area (e.g., uptime, response time).
2.  **Service Level Objectives (SLO):** Establish target and minimum service levels. Can include penalties for underperformance and incentives for exceeding targets.
3.  **Service Level Measurements:** Define how metrics are measured (interval, team, frequency).
4.  **Service Level Reports:** Specify the format and method for reporting service levels.

**Examples of SLA Metrics (also called "Service Level Items" or "Configuration Items"):**

*   **Application System:** On-time processing rate, program revision rate, system response speed/time, number of malfunctions.
*   **Hardware (HW):** System operation rate, backup compliance, malfunction handling rate, number of HW malfunctions, disk usage.
*   **Network:** Line failure rate, network availability/utilization, troubleshooting compliance.
*   **Service Desk:** Call processing rate, number of calls handled, call waiting rate, help desk system availability, employee absenteeism.
*   **Security:** User request processing rate, customer profile accuracy, security training sessions, personal information inspection count.
*   **Strategy:** Number of suggestions received, compliance with training plans.

### 5. Understanding Service Level Management (SLM)

SLM is a core ITIL process that manages service level objectives (SLOs) within an SLA and notifies of any infringements. It's essential for managing IT service levels.

**Component Elements of SLM:**

1.  **Service Catalog:** A document listing all available services and their metadata.
2.  **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** The written contract on agreed IT service levels.
3.  **SLO (Service Level Objectives):** The specific list of IT services covered by the SLA and their target levels.
4.  **OLA (Operational Level Agreement):** An internal agreement between departments within a service supplier to ensure effective communication and management of the SLA.
5.  **Service Quality Plan:** An internal plan detailing everything required to ensure agreed service levels.
6.  **Service Report:** Periodic assessment of SLA violations.
7.  **SLM Engine:** An automated system to measure metrics, automate reports, and monitor services in real-time.

**Operating Criteria for SLAs and SLMs:**
*   Evaluation criteria must be **specific, quantitative, and objective.**
*   Criteria must be **verified.**
*   Ensure **seamless baseline setting** and **smooth management of changes.**

@ The ITIL v3 process
ITIL v3 was born as a business  value model from ITIL v2. It supports  IT governance  (lacking  in ITIL v2), and extends  IT
service  management  to all areas of a business.

ITIL v3 consists  of 5 process  areas. This 5-step process  of continuous  service improvement  (Service  Strategy  >
Service Design — Service Implementation  — Service Operations)  is a continuous,  repeated  cycle. In particular,  the
performance  evaluation  (ROI) area was strengthened  in ITIL v3 because  it was deficient  in v2. By reflecting  the
performance  results back into service  strategy,  ITIL v3 further  strengthens  the IT service  capabilities  of an enterprise.
