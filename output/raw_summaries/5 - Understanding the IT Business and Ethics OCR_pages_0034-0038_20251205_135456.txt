## Learning Guide: IT Business Strategy & Environment Analysis

This guide covers the process of setting business strategies and analyzing the internal and external environments that influence them.

---

### Section 1: The Strategy Setting Process

The strategy-setting process ensures a company plans and executes its future direction effectively. It involves four main phases:

1.  **Strategy Analysis:** Investigating basic company information and studying its current (As-Is) state.
2.  **Strategy Selection:** Establishing the future (To-Be) model and the strategy to achieve it.
3.  **Strategy Implementation & Management:** Adopting and putting the strategy into effect, making adjustments as needed.
4.  **Feedback:** Continuous monitoring and feeding information back to the analysis phase to ensure ongoing relevance.

### Section 2: Strategy Analysis Explained

**Purpose:** To collect information vital for making sound business decisions.

**Key Environments:**

*   **Internal Environment:** Elements within the company's control (e.g., resources, processes). Can be improved directly.
*   **External Environment:** Conditions outside the company's direct control (e.g., market trends, regulations). Requires adaptive strategies.

**Analysis Types:**

1.  **External Environment Analysis:**
    *   Examines conditions outside the company.
    *   **Macro-environment:** Broad factors influencing multiple industries (e.g., political, economic, social, technological).
    *   **Micro-environment:** Industry-specific environment where the company competes for resources and sales (competitive environment).

2.  **Internal Environment Analysis:**
    *   Focuses on internal elements, processes, resources, organizational structure, and internal changes.

3.  **Consolidated Environment Analysis:**
    *   Combines both external and internal factors for an integrated view.
    *   **SWOT Analysis:** A crucial tool for this. It identifies:
        *   **S**trengths (Internal)
        *   **W**eaknesses (Internal)
        *   **O**pportunities (External)
        *   **T**hreats (External)

### Section 3: Strategy Selection

**Purpose:** To choose the optimal future direction for the company based on insights from the Strategy Analysis phase.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Review Analysis Results:** Thoroughly examine the information from the strategy analysis. Flawed analysis leads to poor strategy choices.
2.  **Identify Alternatives:** Generate a list of potential strategic directions, each with different resource requirements and solutions.
3.  **Evaluate & Choose:** Assess each alternative against established evaluation standards and select the most appropriate strategic direction.

---

### Section 4: Strategy Implementation & Management

**Purpose:** To execute the chosen strategy and oversee its progress.

**Key Aspects:**

*   **Execution:** Adopt and put the selected strategic alternative into effect.
*   **Managerial Issues:** Be prepared for challenges related to:
    *   Resource availability and viability.
    *   Company culture and structural readiness for change.
    *   Change management processes.
    *   Strategy realization path and development methods.
    *   Steering group readiness within the company.
    *   Influence over internal and external stakeholders.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback:** Continuously track strategy progress. Status updates are fed back to the analysis phase to inform future decisions.
*   **Adaptation:** If unexpected external or internal changes occur after initial analysis, re-evaluate the strategy to ensure its continued validity.

        *   **Threat of New Entrants:** How easy is it for new companies to join the market? (Entry barriers, product differentiation, new entrant financial resources, market penetration).
        *   **Threat of Substitutes:** How likely are customers to switch to alternative products/services? (Changes in consumer needs, price competitiveness of substitutes, impact of replacement).

3.  **3C & 4P Analysis Method (Micro-environment)**
    *   **Purpose:** To analyze the industry market, used broadly for marketing and competitive environment analysis.
    *   **3C's (Customer, Company, Competition):**
        *   **Customer Analysis:** Estimate market size & growth, identify target customers, product positioning, and demand hierarchy.
        *   **Company Analysis:** Examine internal/external environment, strengths/weaknesses (often with SWOT), and use for goal setting & strategy development.
        *   **Competitor Analysis:** Identify current/potential competitors using market analysis, financial data, and business portfolios.
    *   **4P's (Product, Price, Place, Promotion):**
        *   **Product Analysis:** Examine design, brand, characteristics, performance, quality.
        *   **Price Analysis:** Analyze product price, discounts, demand-price relationship, competitor pricing, and price flexibility.
        *   **Place Analysis:** Analyze sales region, distribution, logistics, and inventory levels.
        *   **Promotion Analysis:** Analyze advertising, promotion, marketing, and customer communication strategies.

#### B) Internal Environment Analysis Methods

1.  **7S Analysis Method**
    *   **Purpose:** To analyze a company's internal environment, diagnose its health, and identify its core competency components.
    *   **Origin:** Developed by McKinsey consulting firm.
    *   **Seven "S" Components:** The model defines 7 core components starting with 'S'.
        *   **Shared Values:** Analyze the ideals, mission, and core beliefs universally shared among organization members.

The performance  index describes  the performance  target  value for each goal.
C) Strategy  setting  process
The strategy-setting  process  consists  of strategy  analysis,  strategy  selection,  strategy  implementation  and
management,  and feedback.  First, in the strategy  analysis  phase, basic information  regarding  the company  is
investigated,  and the As-Is model is studied.  In the strategy  selection  phase, the future (To-Be) model and the
strategy  for realizing  the To-Be model are established.  In the strategy  implementation  and management  phase, the
strategy  is adopted  and put into effect. When necessary,  adjustments  can be made to a strategic plan during this
phase.

@ Strategy  analysis
The purpose  of the strategy  analysis is to collect  the information  required to make the business  decisions  of the
company.  The internal environment  can be improved  because  it can be controlled  by the company,  whereas  the
external  environment  is generally  difficult  to control and requires  an adaptive  strategy.
+ External  environment  analysis
This is an analysis  of the environment  surrounding  a company  and other external  conditions.
- (Macro-environment)  This is the political,  economic,  social and technological  environment  surrounding  a company.
The boundaries  of its influence  can be expanded  across several industries.
- (Micro-environment)  As the industrial  environment  to which a company  belongs,  the micro-environment  is where
the company  faces competition  when acquiring  resources  and selling  its products/services,  and is what we often call
a general  competitive  environment.
+ Internal  environment  analysis
The analysis  of a company’s  internal environment  focuses  on internal elements  and processes,  resources,
organizations,  etc., and also focuses  on the internal  changes  taking place within a company.
+ Consolidated  environment  analysis
- A comprehensive  analysis  of the external  and internal environmental  factors of a company  is carried out, and
integrated  internal/external  analysis  results can be obtained.
- SWOT analysis  is an important  tool of consolidated  environment  analysis.  A SWOT analysis  examines  the strengths
(S) and weaknesses  (W) of a company’s  internal  environment  and the opportunities  (O) and threats  (T) present  in its
external  environment.

ESSENCE
@ Strategy  selection
In the strategy  selection  phase, the best possible  direction  for the future of the company  is selected  based on the
information  collected  in the strategy  analysis phase. If the information  obtained  during the strategy  analysis  phase
is incomplete  or defective,  it becomes  impossible  to determine  whether  the strategy  chosen by an organization  is
the right one. Therefore,  strategy  selection  must begin with a thorough  review of the results and inferences  of the
preceding  strategy  analysis  phase.
If this process  is completed  seamlessly,  it will produce  an optional  list of alternatives  to a set of strategic  directions
that a company  can adopt. It is common  for each of these alternatives  to have different  resource  requirements  with
unique solutions  to key issues.
Each alternative  is evaluated  according  to a reasonably  established  evaluation  standard,  and, ultimately,  the most
appropriate  alternative  is chosen  as the strategic  direction.
© Strategy  implementation  and management
In the strategy implementation  and management  phase, the chosen strategic  alternative  is adopted  and put into
effect. During this phase, several managerial  issues could emerge, such as the viability  of a company’s  resources
for executing  a strategy,  the readiness  of a company’s  culture and structure,  the change management  for realizing
a strategy,  the path of strategy realization  and the development  method  decision,  the strategy implementation
readiness  of the steering  group within the company,  and the level of influence  over internal/external  stakeholders,  etc.
The progress  of the strategy  is monitored  continuously,  and the status of the strategy  is delivered  from the
implementation  phase to the analysis  phase via a feedback  path. The progress  of the strategy  may influence  the
internal  or external  environment  of the company.
In addition,  the internal or external  environment  may change due to the occurrence  of unexpected  events after
completion  of the strategy  analysis.  Therefore,  a review of the strategy  analysis  should be conducted  to ensure that
the chosen  strategic  direction  is still valid.
