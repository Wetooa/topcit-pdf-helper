## Learning Guide: System Architecture & Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### 1. Fault-Tolerant Systems

**What it is:** A system designed to continue operating its intended functions even if some of its parts fail.
*   **How it works:** It can withstand component failures. However, if more components fail, more functions become unavailable. A critical failure will eventually shut the system down.

**Steps to Handle Faults (Troubleshooting):**
1.  **Fault Detection:** Identify which module caused the fault using comparative logic.
2.  **Fault Diagnosis:** Determine if the fault is temporary (transient) or permanent (hard). If permanent, exclude the faulty module.
3.  **Fault Isolation:** Prevent the error from spreading to other parts of the system.
4.  **Fault Recovery:** Remove the faulty module, then restore and reconfigure the system.

**Fault-Tolerant Techniques:**

*   **General Techniques:**
    *   **Checkpoint Technique:** Detects errors in the source code that might cause a fault.
    *   **Protocol Monitoring:** Applies fault tolerance by monitoring and tracking communication protocols.
*   **Hardware Tolerant Techniques:**
    *   **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR):** Three or more processors perform the same operation simultaneously with the same inputs to ensure accuracy.
    *   **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Achieves fault tolerance through disk mirroring and spreading parity bits across multiple disks.
    *   **Duplication with Comparison:** Uses redundant hardware for fault detection by comparing outputs.
    *   **Standby Sparing:** Keeps spare hardware ready to take over if a primary component fails.
    *   **Watchdog Timer:** A timer that periodically resets the system if it detects a malfunction.
    *   **Checkpointer:** Allows a system to restart from a previous stable point (checkpoint) if a fault occurs.
*   **Software Tolerant Techniques:**
    *   **Recovery Block:** Rolls back and retries an operation on a single processor if it fails.
    *   **Conversation:** Coordinates processing between multiple processors to ensure consistent results.
    *   **Distributed Rollback:** A rollback technique used in systems spread across multiple machines.

### 2. Disaster Recovery System (DRS)

**What it is:** A comprehensive plan and system to minimize the business impact of a disaster. It involves setting up all or part of the IT infrastructure in a different location to enable quick recovery.

**Types of Disaster Recovery (DR) Centers:**

| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | RTO (Recovery Time Objective)   |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Mirrored Site** | An exact replica of the main data center (facilities, IT, network) in a remote location. Both sites are active simultaneously (active-active).                                                 | **Immediate**                   |
| **Hot Site**    | An exact replica of the main data center (facilities, IT, network) in a remote location, kept in a standby state (active-standby). It switches to active if the main site fails. Data is kept updated via real-time mirroring. | **Within 4 hours**              |
| **Warm Site**   | A DR center with only crucial IT resources. Critical components from the main center are transferred and set up at the DR center during a disaster. Only data is kept in the remote location.       | **Days to Weeks**               |
| **Cold Site**   | A remote location with minimal resources like power, communication, and network. Computer components and network are procured and established only *after* a disaster occurs.                       | **Weeks to Months**             |

**Disaster Recovery Goals:**
The two most critical factors for a DR system are:
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** The maximum tolerable downtime. It's the target time to restore business operations to normal after a disaster.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** The maximum tolerable data loss. It's the amount of data (often measured in time, e.g., 1 hour of data) that can be lost during a disaster.

### 3. Cloud Computing

**Recent Trends & Importance:**
*   **Shift:** Traditional IT (mainframes, UNIX) is moving rapidly to cloud computing.
*   **Characteristics:** Virtualization, immediate availability, and linear scalability (scale-out).
*   **Driving Factors:** Rapid growth of social media, internet services, big data, and IoT.
*   **Necessity:** Cloud services are now essential, not optional, underpinning new technologies like AI, big data, and blockchain due to their scalability and speed.
*   **Evolution of Virtualization:** Moving from hypervisor-based server virtualization to lighter, faster container-type virtualization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

**What is Cloud Computing?**
*   **Purpose:** Developed to efficiently use computer capacity and flexibly respond to uncertain service demands.
*   **Definition:** Instead of owning and managing IT resources, users access computing resources (servers, storage, networks, applications) over the internet, in a virtualized form, when they need them, and pay based on usage.
*   **Key Idea:** Resources are available via a network, abstracted (users don't need to know complex internal details), allowing work from anywhere.

**Benefits of Cloud Services:**
*   **Costs:** Reduces initial capital expenditure (CAPEX), potentially increases operating expenditure (OPEX), leading to lower total cost of ownership (TCO).
    *   *CAPEX:* Money spent on assets for future profits.
    *   *OPEX:* Costs of running a business day-to-day.
    *   *TCO:* Total cost over a system's lifespan (investment + maintenance).
*   **Time:** Shortens development time and product development cycles.
*   **Operation:** Decreases the need for operating personnel and improves resource efficiency.
*   **Product:** Enhances product integration.

**Official Definitions (Korea Telecommunication Association - TTA):**
*   **Cloud Service:** An on-demand outsourced IT service that provides a user-centered cloud computing environment.
*   **Cloud Computing:** A computing environment that leases IT resources over the Internet, using virtualization and distributed processing technology, with usage-based fees.

**Cloud Computing Compared to Other Technologies:**

*   **Cloud Computing vs. Grid Computing:**
    *   **Similarities:** Both use distributed computing and provide virtualized resources.
    *   **Differences:**
        | Feature            | Grid Computing                                      | Cloud Computing                                     |
        | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
        | **Computer Location** | Geographically scattered, managed by different organizations | Geographically scattered, but managed by a central organization |
        | **Configuration**  | Heterogeneous (mixed types)                        | Mostly homogeneous (same models)                    |
        | **Standardization** | Existing organizations, defined standards          | No specific standardization organizations/standards |
        | **Interconnectivity** | Important                                          | Not explicitly considered                           |
        | **Usage**          | Highly parallel applications (e.g., scientific calculations) | General-purpose applications (e.g., web apps)       |

*   **Cloud Computing vs. Utility Computing:**
    *   **Similarity:** Both charge for resources used.
    *   **Relationship:** Cloud computing developed the abstraction of computing resources, building upon the "pay-as-you-go" model of utility computing.

**Types of Cloud Computing (by Service Type):**
Cloud services are commonly categorized into three main types:
*   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides fundamental computing infrastructure resources (virtual servers, storage, networks) as a service over the Internet. You manage the operating system, applications, and data.

02 Fault-Tolerant  System
A) Fault-tolerant  system
A fault-tolerant  system can continuously  perform  the functions  specified in the design, even if a system part fails. A
fault-tolerant  system cannot use certain functions  when a component  fails. When components  continue  to fail, the
unavailable  functions  gradually  increase,  and the system  shuts down when a critical  failure occurs.
[Table 23] Troubleshooting  Steps
Step Description
Fault detection - Analyzes  which module  has caused  fault, through  comparative  logic.
Fault diagnosis- Determines  whether  the fault is temporary  (transient)  or permanent  (hard) and excludes  the hard

B) Disaster  recovery  goal
The most important  factors  to consider  when implementing  a DR system are RTO and RPO. RTO represents  the time
required  to return to normal operation,  when a disaster  or failure occurs in the operating  system.  RPO represents  an
indicator  of tolerable  data loss, i.e, the amount  of data that can be lost.
