### 1. Overview of Embedded Systems

#### A) Definition
An **embedded system** is a computer system designed to perform a **specific function** within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It controls a machine or other systems requiring precise control.

**Key characteristics:**
*   It's an electronic system **built into** a device.
*   It contains a **microprocessor** (or microcontroller) and a program that drives it.
*   It performs functions beyond simple circuits in everyday devices.
*   It's a combination of **hardware** and **software**.

**Components:**
*   **Embedded Hardware:** Includes a microprocessor/microcontroller (like a CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) devices, network devices, sensors, and drivers.
*   **Embedded Software:** Consists of:
    *   **Operating System (OS):** Controls hardware directly and manages other software.
    *   **System Software**
    *   **Application Software**
    *   Unlike conventional software, its main goal is to respond to the physical world, characterized by factors like time, energy, and permanence.

#### B) Examples of Embedded Systems
Embedded systems are ubiquitous, controlling many devices we use daily, from small wearables to large industrial facilities:

*   **Office:** Telephones, fax machines, copiers
*   **Gaming:** Arcade and console game machines
*   **Industry/Control:** Automation systems, factory control, fire systems
*   **Vehicles/Transportation:** Engine controls, navigators, subway controls
*   **Logistics/Finance:** POS systems, ATMs, card readers
*   **Medical:** Diabetes meters, ECG meters, MRI systems
*   **Wearable:** Smartwatches, health bands
*   **Digital Advertising:** Digital Information Displays (DID)
*   **Aviation/Shipbuilding:** Control and signal systems
*   **Robots/Drones:** Industrial controls, aviation filming

#### C) Characteristics
Embedded systems are optimized for their specific tasks, leading to unique design considerations:

1.  **Low Cost:**
    *   Often mass-produced in millions, making cost reduction critical.
    *   Systems not requiring high processing power or resources can use slower processors and smaller memory to save costs.

2.  **Low Performance (Optimized):**
    *   Overall structure is simplified to reduce cost, compared to general-purpose computers.
    *   May use slower interfaces (e.g., serial bus, 1024 times slower than PC interfaces) if high speed isn't required.

3.  **Resource Constraints:**
    *   Programs operate with real-time constraints on limited hardware.
    *   Often lacks a disk drive, standard OS, keyboard, or screen.
    *   May use **flash drives** for storage or have minimal user interfaces (e.g., small keypad, LCD).

4.  **Stability:**
    *   Designed for reliable, error-free operation over many years.
    *   Firmware undergoes rigorous development and testing.
    *   Avoids mechanical parts (disk drives, switches) prone to damage, favoring durable chip materials like flash memory.

5.  **Resilience:**
    *   Must operate reliably in harsh or inaccessible environments (e.g., oil boreholes, outer space).
    *   Designed to restart itself even in critical failure scenarios.
    *   **Watchdog Timer (WDT):** An electronic timer that detects and recovers computer failures by restarting the system if it doesn't "check in" periodically.

### 2. Embedded System Development Process

Developing an embedded system differs from conventional software development by integrating **hardware development**.

**Development Stages & Key Tasks:**

1.  **Product Planning:**
    *   **Goal:** Determine commercial feasibility (price, technology, market).
    *   **Task:** Define rough product specifications and timing.

2.  **Hardware Part Selection & OS Selection:**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Selects hardware components (CPU, memory, peripherals) that meet requirements at the lowest cost.
    *   **Software Team:** Selects the appropriate Operating System (OS) based on product characteristics (e.g., RTOS, embedded Linux).

3.  **Hardware Circuit Diagram Generation & Software Structure Design:**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Creates the detailed circuit diagram. (Errors here can be very costly).
    *   **Software Team:** Designs module-to-module interfaces and identifies required software libraries.

4.  **Code Design for Each Artwork Module:**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Performs **artwork** – generating data to connect actual physical parts on the circuit diagram, considering part size, connector shape, and wiring.
    *   **Software Team:** Designs the code for each module, ensuring it works with the defined interfaces.

5.  **Making the PWB & Integrating Modules:**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Manufactures the **PWB (Printed Wiring Board)** – the physical circuit board where components are mounted, using the artwork data.
    *   **Software Team:** Integrates software modules (e.g., bootloader, Linux kernel, and applications for an embedded Linux system).

6.  **Part Mounting & Hardware Testing:**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Mounts components (CPU, memory) onto the PWB.
    *   **Software Team:** Tests the actual hardware to ensure it operates as intended (e.g., testing CPU ports, memory, I/O devices using specific test programs).

7.  **Integrated Testing & Debugging:**
    *   **Goal:** Install software on hardware, identify and solve problems before mass production.
    *   **Task:** Establish countermeasures for unexpected issues like increasing part defect rates.

8.  **Mass-production Testing:**
    *   **Timing:** Conducted after functional stabilization, typically six months before mass production.
    *   **Scope:** Performed in various challenging environments (high temperature/humidity, sub-zero) for about six months to ensure reliability for worldwide export.

9.  **Quality Inspection (EMI & Safety):**
    *   **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference):** Inspects if electromagnetic waves from the product interfere with other electronic devices. Designers incorporate EMI data into debugging circuits.
    *   **Safety:** Tests the overall stability and safety of the product.

10. **Product Shipment:** The final finished product is shipped.

### 3. Embedded Hardware

#### A) Microprocessor: The Core of Embedded Systems

**Microprocessor Unit (MPU):**
*   A single chip integrating registers (for data processing), an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for mathematical operations, and flags (for storing result values).
*   Provides the performance needed to drive devices.
*   Historically, MPU and CPU (Central Processing Unit) were distinct, but their boundaries are now ambiguous, with MPU often referring to a general-purpose processor.

**Microcontroller:**
*   A specialized type of MPU.
*   Integrates a processor, memory, and control interface **all on a single chip**.
*   Ideal for real-time operating systems (RTOS) and automatic control applications due to its compact and integrated nature.

**Usage:**
*   MPUs are included in almost all electronic devices that allow user intervention or configuration.
*   Commonly found in smartphones, smart bands, and tablet PCs.

A) Definition  of embedded  system
An embedded  system is a computer  system that performs  a specific function  for controlling  a machine  or other
systems  requiring  control,  and an electronic  system in the device.
In more detail, it is a system with a built-in microprocessor  and a program  that drives the microprocessor  to perform
a specific  function,  more than just simple circuits in various  electronic  devices,  home appliances,  and control devices
used in our daily life.
An embedded  system is configured  of a set of hardware  and software,  as shown in [Figure 71].
+ Embedded  hardware:  Embedded  hardware  consists  of a microprocessor/microcontroller,  equivalent  to a CPU,
memory,  input/output  device, network  device, sensor, driver, etc.
+ Embedded  software:  Embedded  software  consists  of an operating  system (OS) that directly  controls  hardware  and
manages  the software,  system software,  and application software.  Unlike conventional  software,  the main purpose
of the embedded  software  is to provide an appropriate  response  to the physical  world. Therefore,  embedded
software  has the characteristics  of the physical  world, such as time, energy,  and permanence.

B) Characteristics  of embedded  system
Since an embedded  system  performs  a specific  mission,  engineers  can optimize  the design in order to reduce  the size
and production  cost and to increase  reliability  and performance.
@ Low cost
Many embedded  systems  are mass-produced  in units of millions  and the reduction  of production  costs is one of the
crucial factors. Some embedded  systems  that do not require high processing  performance  or resources  can have a
relatively  slow processor  and small memory  in order to reduce costs.
@ Low performance
Many embedded  system parts have low performance.  Here, being slow does not simply refer to a slow clock speed. In

Overview  of System Architecture )
general,  an embedded  system's  overall structure  is intentionally  simplified  to reduce cost, compared  to the hardware
of general-purpose  computer  systems.  For example,  embedded  systems  often use peripherals  controlled  by a serial
bus that is 1024 times slower  than the conventional  peripheral  interfaces  that are used in personal  computers.
@ Resource  constraints
Programs  on embedded  systems  usually  operate  with real-time  constraints  on limited hardware  resources.  There is
often no disk drive, operating  system,  keyboard,  or screen on the system.  It may not have a file system,  or it may use
a flash drive as a storage  medium.  Even if there is a user interface,  it could be a small keypad  or LCD.
