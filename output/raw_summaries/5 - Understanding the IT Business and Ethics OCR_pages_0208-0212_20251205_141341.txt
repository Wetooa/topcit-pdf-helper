## **Understanding Copyright and Software Ethics**

### **1. Copyright and Related Rights**

Copyright protects original works of authorship. It has two main components:

*   **Moral Rights:**
    *   **Nature:** Personal, mental, non-monetary, non-transferable.
    *   **Purpose:** Protects the author's personal connection to their work.
    *   **Examples:** Right of attribution (being named), right to publish anonymously/pseudonymously, right to integrity of the work (preventing distortion).

*   **Economic Rights:**
    *   **Nature:** Property-based, monetary, transferable.
    *   **Purpose:** Allows the author to profit from their work.
    *   **Examples:** Right of reproduction, performance, broadcasting, exhibition, distribution, rental, and production of derivative works.

**Neighboring Rights:**
These rights are granted to those who "create added value" to a work, but are not the original author.
*   **Performers:** Rights like attribution, integrity, reproduction, distribution, performance, broadcasting.
*   **Record Producers:** Rights of reproduction, distribution, rental.
*   **Broadcasters:** Rights of reproduction, performance, simultaneous broadcasting.

### **2. Copyright Authorship Presumption**

If the actual creator of a work is hard to identify, copyright law provides presumptions:

*   **Author Presumed If:**
    *   Their **real name or well-known pseudonym** is indicated on the original/copies of the work in a usual manner.
    *   Their **real name or well-known pseudonym** is indicated during a public performance or transmission of the work.
*   **If no author name is indicated:** The **publisher, public performer, or person making the work public** is presumed to have the copyright.

### **3. Key Copyright Terms**

*   **Public Performance:** Presenting works (e.g., acting, singing, screening) to the public.
*   **Public Transmission:** Making works available to the public via wired or wireless means (e.g., internet).
*   **Publication:** Reproducing and distributing works to meet public demand.
*   **Making Works Public:** Opening works to the public through public performance, transmission, exhibition, or publication.

### **4. Types of Copyright-Protected Works**

A "work" is a creative production expressing human thoughts and emotions, possessing **originality** and **externality**.

*   **Literary Works:** Novels, poems, theses, lectures, speeches, plays, written & oral works (books, magazines).
*   **Musical Works:** Compositions (music, lyrics).
*   **Theatrical Works:** Dramas, choreographies, pantomimes (expressions through body movements).
*   **Artistic Works:** Paintings, sculptures, printmaking, crafts, applied art (aesthetic shapes/colors).
*   **Architectural Works:** Buildings, architectural models, design drawings.
*   **Photographic Works:** Creative expressions with original and aesthetic photographic elements.
*   **Cinematographic Works:** Movies, dramas (moving images reproducible by mechanical/electronic devices).
*   **Diagrammatic Works:** Maps, charts, design drawings, models (expressed by figures).
*   **Computer Program Works:** Series of instructions/commands applied to devices (like computers) to achieve specific results.
*   **Derivative Works:** New creative works produced by translating, arranging, altering, or adapting an original work (e.g., a movie based on a novel). Protected independently.
*   **Compilation Works:** Creative compilations of materials (e.g., selecting or arranging data), regardless of the material itself. Includes databases (systematically organized data searchable by information processing devices).

### **5. Works Made for Hire**

*   **Definition:** A work created by an employee for a legal entity (e.g., company, organization) during their duties and at the entity's initiative.
*   **Authorship:** The **legal entity** is considered the author, unless a contract or work regulations state otherwise.
*   **Requirements for Legal Entity to be Author:**
    1.  The work was **initiated by the legal entity**.
    2.  It was **written by an employee** engaged in the entity's business.
    3.  It was a work **written for the entity's business**.
    4.  It was **publicized in the name of the legal entity**.
    5.  There are **no contrary stipulations** in the contract or work rules.

### **6. Computer Program Works & Software Licensing**

*   **Software Definition:** A collection of instructions and commands that enable equipment (computers, communication devices) to process information, interact, and perform tasks. Includes related data and descriptions used to prepare them.
*   **Computer Program Work:** The program itself and its descriptive language.
*   **What is Protected by Copyright:**
    *   **Source code** and **object code** (compiled source code).
    *   **Program structure** and **arrangement method**.
*   **What is NOT Protected by Copyright:**
    *   Programming languages (e.g., C, Java).
    *   Protocols.
    *   Algorithms.
    *(These are considered ideas or tools, not the specific creative expression of a program).*
*   **Software Licensing:**
    *   The software author typically holds exclusive rights (use, copy, distribute, modify).
    *   A **license** is an agreement where the author grants specific permissions (rights) to others.
    *   License agreements define terms to prevent disputes, covering aspects like purpose, definitions, royalties, and contract duration.

### **7. Open Source Software (OSS) Copyright**

*   **Definition:** Software where anyone can freely use, copy, distribute, and modify its source code.
*   **Examples:** Apache web server, Firefox Web Browser, Linux Kernel.
*   **Common Open Source Licenses:**
    *   **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution License):**
        *   Highly permissive.
        *   No obligation to disclose source code.
        *   No copyright notice or warranty liability required when distributing.
    *   **Apache License 2.0:**
        *   No obligation to disclose source code.
        *   If modified and distributed, must include the Apache License 2.0 and disclose its Apache Foundation origin.
    *   **GPL 2.0/3.0 (GNU General Public License):**
        *   Created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
        *   Most widely adopted.
        *   **Stricter obligations (copyleft):** Requires derivative works to be distributed under the same GPL license, meaning their source code must also be made available.
    *   **GNU LGPL 2.1 (Lesser GPL):**
        *   Designed for libraries.
        *   Less strict copyleft than GPL. Allows linking to simple libraries/modules without forcing the entire linked application to be LGPL. No obligation to provide source code for simply linking.
    *   **MPL (Mozilla Public License):**
        *   Separates copyright for source code and executable files.
        *   Executable files can sometimes be distributed under an exclusive license.
        *   **File-level copyleft:** Modifications to MPL-licensed files must remain MPL, but it allows linking with proprietary code.
*   **Basic Requirements for Most OSS Licenses:**
    1.  Indicate developer/contributor and copyright information on the product.
    2.  If the source code is modified, include information about the modification (who, when).
    3.  Attach a copy of the license when distributing the software.
*   **Copyleft:** A clause in some open source licenses that requires derivative works (or modified versions) to be distributed under the same license, including providing the source code.

### **8. Works Not Protected by Copyright Law**

The following types of works are generally *not* protected by copyright:

*   **Laws & Government Documents:**
    *   Constitutions, Acts, treaties, decrees, municipal ordinances and rules.
    *   Bulletins, public notifications, directives issued by central or local government.
    *   Compilations or translations of works produced by central or local government.
*   **Judicial & Administrative Decisions:**
    *   Judgments, decisions, orders, adjudications of courts.
    *   Rulings and decisions made through administrative appeals or similar procedures.
*   **Simple Facts:**
    *   Current news reporting that delivers simple facts (e.g., headlines, raw data).
