## Information Security Learning Guide

This guide covers essential concepts in information security, focusing on key definitions, functionalities, and practical applications.

### 1. Core Information Security Principles

*   **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is viewable *only* by authorized and legitimate users.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring data is original, *without forgery or alteration*.
*   These principles are crucial for responding to security threats.

### 2. Emerging Security Technologies & Concepts

#### A. FIDO 2.0 (Fast Identity Online)

*   **Purpose:** A standard for easier and more secure online authentication.
*   **Protocol:** Does *not* use the UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) protocol. Instead, it uses its own server-defined protocol for message exchange.
*   **Client Implementation:** FIDO client is provided as an API by the operating system or as a JavaScript API by web browsers (unlike FIDO 1.0 which used Android apps).

#### B. Network Segregation

*   **Definition:** Separating a business network from external networks (like the internet) to block unauthorized access and prevent internal information leakage.
*   **Types:**

| Feature          | Physical Network Segregation                               | Logical Network Segregation                                   |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operation**    | Physical separation using 2 separate PCs.                  | Logical separation using virtualization or other methods (1 PC). |
| **Introduction** | High cost (additional PC, network installation).           | Low cost (depends on environment).                            |
| **Security**     | High (basic segregation).                                  | Low (potential vulnerabilities).                              |
| **Efficiency**   | Low (affects work environment).                            | Easy to manage (applying security policies).                  |
| **Details**      | Uses 2 PCs, multi-PC setups, or network switching devices. | Server-based or PC-based.                                     |

#### C. Fraud Detection System (FDS)

*   **Definition:** A system that detects and blocks suspicious or abnormal financial transactions by analyzing device, access, and transaction details.
*   **Core Engine:** **Pattern Analysis** – learns typical user transaction patterns and flags any actions that deviate from these patterns as abnormal.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Information Collection:** Gathers user environment, behavior, and accident type information.
    *   **Analysis & Detection:** Identifies abnormal behavior by analyzing various correlations and testing patterns against collected data.
    *   **Response:** Blocks illegal transactions or requires additional authentication when abnormal behavior is detected.

#### D. Quantum Cryptography

*   **Definition:** A cryptographic technology leveraging quantum mechanics, unlike traditional cryptography which relies on mathematical complexity.
*   **Key Property:** A quantum cannot be copied or returned to its original state.
*   **Security:** If an eavesdropper attempts to measure a quantum (to intercept data), its state changes. This change allows the legitimate receiver to detect the eavesdropping attempt.

#### E. Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

*   **Definition:** A hardware-based security module, established as a standard by the TCG (Trusted Computing Group).
*   **Purpose:** Addresses limitations of software-only security by providing a strong, hardware-isolated security environment.
*   **Function:** Securely stores sensitive data (e.g., encrypted keys, passwords, digital certificates) in a hardware-separated space. Ensures critical operations like key management and encryption processing occur *within* the secure device.
*   **Version:** TPM 2 was released in September 2016 and includes the Mobile Trusted Module (MTM).

#### F. Re-identification

*   **De-identification:** The process of converting data so that an individual cannot be identified from it.
*   **Re-identification:** The process of identifying an individual from *de-identified* data by combining, analyzing, and processing it with other external information.
*   **Risk:** Can lead to accidental or intentional disclosure of personal information, especially with the widespread use of big data and information collected from online sources (SNS, websites).

#### G. EU-GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

*   **Effective Date:** May 25, 2018.
*   **Purpose:** An EU law aimed at protecting personal information and regulating its use within the European Union.
*   **Impact:** Mandatory for all EU member states. Non-EU companies (e.g., Korean companies) must comply if they process personal information of EU residents, even if operating overseas (extra-territorial scope). Violations incur significant penalties.
*   **Major Changes:**
    *   **Mandatory Enforcement:** Unlike previous EU directives which were recommendations, GDPR is a strict regulation with penalties for non-compliance.
    *   **Extra-territorial Scope:** Applies to companies based in the EU *and* companies outside the EU that process personal data of EU residents (e.g., via e-commerce).
    *   **Increased Responsibilities:**
        *   **For Enterprises:** Mandates roles like the Data Protection Officer (DPO).
        *   **For Individuals (Data Owners):** Grants increased rights, such as the right to data portability.

### 3. Key Information Security Terms (from page 23)

These are important terms related to cryptography, authentication, and access control:

*   Encryption algorithm
*   Private key encryption
*   Public key encryption
*   Hash function
*   Authentication
*   Digital signature
*   PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
*   Access control
*   Cryptographic protocol
*   DES (Data Encryption Standard)
*   AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
*   RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
*   ECC (Elliptic-curve cryptography)
*   Hash collision
*   Public certificate
*   Multi-factor authentication
*   Session key

### 4. Practical Application: Ensuring Confidentiality

When managing sensitive data like source code, especially when exchanging it with partners or storing it:

*   **Challenge:** Regular checks are insufficient against diversified and intelligent security threats. Data must be protected from unauthorized disclosure to competitors or third parties.
*   **Solution:** **Confidentiality** must be ensured for source programs during both storage and transmission. This involves applying appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Information  security )
Windows  and Android,  and the web platform  based on the web browser.  FIDO server, RP server, and RP client
are the components  that should be provided  by the server. Therefore,  if they are regarded  as a part of the
server, the standard  protocol is not needed anymore.  Therefore,  FIDO 2.0 does not use the UAF protocol,  but
exchanges  messages,  using its own protocol defined by the server. The FIDO client, which was provided  as an
Android  app in the existing  FIDO 1.0, will be provided  as an API by the operating  system,  or as a JavaScript  API
by the web browser.
C) Network  segregation  and network  linking
Network  segregation  refers to network  blocking,  which separates the business  network  from the external
network  in order to block illegal access from the external Internet  network  and to prevent  the leakage  of
internal information.  There are two types - physical  network  segregation  and logical network  segregation.

D) Fraud Detection  System  (FDS)
The FDS is a system that detects suspicious  transactions  and blocks abnormal  financial  transactions  by
comprehensively  analyzing  device information,  access information,  and transaction  details used in electronic
financial  transactions.  Pattern analysis is the core engine of the FDS because  the usual transactions  of the
user are analyzed,  and abnormal  behavior  is detected  when an action that violates  the analyzed  pattern is
taken. The FDS has the following  functions.
© Information  collection
The FDS collects  user media environment  information  and accident  type information  by collecting  information
on user information  and behavior.
@ Analysis  and detection
The FDS detects  abnormal  behavior  by analyzing  various correlations  by user type and transaction  type, and
by testing  the pattern,  based on the analysis  of abnormal  behavior,  using the collected  information.
@ Response
The FDS blocks an illegal transaction  by blocking  the transaction  or by requiring  additional  authentication  when
abnormal  behavior  is detected.

E) Quantum  cryptography
Quantum  cryptography  is a cryptographic  technology  that utilizes the characteristics  of mechanics.  Unlike
existing  cryptosystems  that are based on mathematical  complexities,  quantum  cryptography  is based on
the characteristics  of quantum.  A quantum  cannot be copied or returned  to its original state. Due to these
properties,  the receiver  can detect an eavesdropping  attempt  when a third party measures  the quantum  for
eavesdropping  because  its state is changed  if measured.
F) Trusted  Platform  Module  (TPM)
The trusted platform  module (TPM) is a standard  established  by the TCG (Trusted  Computing  Group), an
international  industry  standard  organization,  to overcome  the limitations  of security  technology  that only
operates  with software.  This module provides  a strong security  environment  that stores important  data
that requires  security  in a secure space separated  by hardware,  such as the encrypted  key, password,  digital
certificate.  It ensures  that key management,  encryption  processing,  etc., are only handled inside the security
device.  The latest TPM 2 was released  in September  2016, which includes  the Mobile  Trusted  Module  (MTM).
G) Re-identification
De-identification  is the process or method of converting  data in such way that an  individual  cannot  be
identified.  Re-identification  is the process  or method of identifying  an individual  from the de-identified  data
by combining,  analyzing,  and processing  it with other information.  Personal  information  may be disclosed,  due
to intentional  or accidental  re-identification,  while collecting  information  from SNS or websites,  like search
engines,  or while companies  that handle personal  information,  such medical and financial institutions,  are
analyzing  data. Recently,  as big data is being used in various  fields, there is concern  that personal  information
may be leaked indiscriminately  due to re-identification.
