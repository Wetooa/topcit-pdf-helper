## Learning Guide: Network Protocols & Multimedia

### Section 1: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

**1. What is FTP?**
*   A protocol for transferring files (or parts of files) between systems.
*   **Key Feature:** Uses two separate connections:
    *   **Control Connection:** Port 21 (TCP). Used for commands and responses. Maintained throughout the FTP session.
    *   **Data Connection:** Port 20 (TCP) by default, or higher (e.g., 1024+) in passive mode. Established only when a file transfer begins.

**2. FTP Transfer Modes**

FTP has two main modes that handle how the data connection is established:

| Feature      | General Transfer Mode (Active)                                   | Passive Transfer Mode (PASV)                                         |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**  | Server connects to a specific client port for data transfer.     | Client connects to a specific server port for data transfer.         |
| **Firewall** | **Problematic** with firewalls (server tries to connect to client). | **Firewall-Friendly** (client initiates all connections).            |
| **Purpose**  | General FTP use.                                                 | FTP from a secured client (e.g., behind a firewall or proxy server). |
| **Data Port**| 20 (default)                                                     | 1024 or higher                                                       |

**3. FTP Command Processing**
*   Uses the control connection (port 21) for communication between server and client control processes.
*   **Interactive Process:** User commands are sent to the server, and the server sends responses back.
    *   **Client Command:** `Command Message: Instruction`
    *   **Server Response:** `Response Code + Meaning`

**4. Types of FTP Commands**

| Command Type           | Examples                                          |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Access**             | USER, PASS, QUIT, ABOR                            |
| **File Management**    | CWD (Change Dir), DELE (Delete), LIST, MKD (Make Dir), PWD (Print Working Dir), RMD (Remove Dir) |
| **Data Forming**       | TYPE, STRU, MODE                                  |
| **Port Definition**    | PORT, PASV (Passive)                              |
| **File Transfer**      | GET, PUT, RETR (Retrieve), STOR (Store), APPE (Append) |
| **Other**              | HELP, NOOP                                        |

**5. FTP Operation Sequence**

*   **General (Active) Transfer Mode:**
    1.  **Client (Port 21):** Connects to server's control port (21) and tells the server which *second port* it will use for data.
    2.  **Server:** Acknowledges (ACK).
    3.  **Server (Port 20):** Attempts to connect to the client's specified *second port*.
    4.  **Client:** Acknowledges (ACK).
    *   *Note: This fails if a firewall blocks the server's incoming connection attempt to the client.*

*   **Passive (PASV) Transfer Mode:**
    1.  **Client (Port 21):** Connects to server's control port (21).
    2.  **Client:** Sends `PASV` command to the server.
    3.  **Server:** Responds with `OK` and informs the client which *second port* it will use for data (e.g., 32567).
    4.  **Client:** Opens another port and attempts to connect to the server's *specified second port*.
    5.  **Server:** Acknowledges (ACK).
    *   *Note: This works with firewalls because the client always initiates the connection.*

### Section 2: Recent Network Trends & Issues

*   **Overview:** High-speed data, convergence technologies, and new network advancements are emerging.
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **Multimedia Networks & Internet Telephony:** Technologies guaranteeing traffic quality (QoS) for services like video streaming and VoIP.
    *   **Internet of Things (IoT) Networks:** Expansion of IoT network-based technologies.
    *   **Software-Based Networks:** New network structures (e.g., SDN, NFV) different from traditional hardware-centric designs.

*   **Keywords for these topics (to be explored later):**
    *   Lossless/Lossy compression, QoS, SIP, H.323, RTP, RTSP, RTCP, IMS, CSCF, HSS, 3GPP, SDN, Openflow, Control plane, Data plane, NFV, Virtualization function, MQTT, CoAP.

### Section 3: Multimedia Network

**1. Graphic Compression Types**
*   Most multimedia network traffic is video data, which relies heavily on compression.
*   Two main types:

    *   **A) Lossless Compression (Reversible Compression)**
        *   **Concept:** Restores a compressed image/data **without any information loss**; the decompressed data is identical to the original.
        *   **Characteristic:** Lower compression rate compared to lossy.
        *   **Methods:**
            *   **Run-length encoding (RLE):** Expresses repeated symbols by the symbol and its repetition count.
            *   **Dictionary coding:** Creates a dictionary, and sends code values (indexes) instead of repeating character strings.
            *   **Huffman coding:** Assigns short binary codes to frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent ones.
            *   **Arithmetic coding:** Maps the entire message to a small section in [0,1] and encodes that section.

    *   **B) Lossy Compression (Irreversible Compression)**
        *   **Concept:** Restored data is **not identical to the original** because some redundant or unnecessary data is permanently lost during compression.
        *   **Characteristic:** Higher compression rate, achieved by compromising some accuracy.
        *   **Types:**
            *   **Prediction Coding:** Used for digitizing analog signals. Quantizes the *difference* between samples (instead of the samples themselves), requiring fewer bits.
            *   **Transform Coding:** Transforms a signal from one domain (e.g., time/space) to another (e.g., frequency) for compression.

**2. Multimedia Data Components**
*   Includes text, image, video, and audio data.

    *   **Text:**
        *   Forms: Plain text, non-linear hypertext.
        *   Standard: Unicode (for symbols).
        *   Compression: Uses lossless methods.

    *   **Image (Still Image):**
        *   Refers to photos, fax pages, or video frames.
        *   **Transmission Process:**
            1.  Original Image
            2.  Transformation Process
            3.  Quantization Process
            4.  Encoding Process
            5.  Binary Data Transmission
            6.  (Reverse process to reconstruct image)

03 File Transfer  Protocol
FTP is a protocol  for transferring  a file, or part of a file, from one system to another  [1]. Unlike other application layer
protocols,  FTP has two connections.  They are control connection  and data connection,  which use ports 21 and 20,
respectively.  The control connection  is maintained  until the client or FTP session is terminated.  The data connection
establishes  a TCP connection  when a file transfer  starts. The data port number  can be a number, other than 20,
depending  on the method  used.
FTP connection  is largely divided  into general  transfer  mode and passive  transfer  mode (PASV). The general  transfer
mode requests  a connection  to a client to establish  a data connection,  and a problem  occurs when it connects  with
an external  server system through a system, such as a firewall.  In contrast,  the client first requests  a connection
to the server  through a channel other than the basic data channel in the passive transfer  mode. Since the client
requests  to establish  an FTP connection, it can pass through  the firewall without  a problem.  It is applicable,  even
when the client's IP is not visible from the outside  because  the client network  uses a proxy server.
