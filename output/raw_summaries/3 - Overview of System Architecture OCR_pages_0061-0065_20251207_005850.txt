## Computer System Architecture: A Study Guide

### 1. Introduction to Computer Architecture

**What is Computer Architecture?**
It's the conceptual design and operational structure that forms the basis of computer systems. Think of it as a blueprint detailing how different parts of a computer are designed to work together, focusing on CPU performance and memory access.

**Recent Trends & Issues:**
*   Modern computers are primarily based on the **Von Neumann architecture**.
*   While performance has improved through parallel processing, new concepts like **neuromorphic chips** (mimicking the human brain) and **quantum computers** are emerging.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
*   Understand basic computer structure and how it operates.
*   Explain memory hierarchy and its principles.
*   Identify latest computer structure technologies and trends.

**Key Terms:**
*   Von Neumann architecture
*   Harvard architecture
*   CPU (Central Processing Unit)
*   Memory unit
*   Input/Output (I/O) device
*   Neuromorphic chip
*   Quantum computer

### 2. Basic Computer Structure

The fundamental function of a computer is to run program code by reading, processing, and storing data in a specified sequence.

**Main Components:**

1.  **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
    *   Also known as the **processor**.
    *   Plays the key role in running programs and processing data.

2.  **Memory**
    *   **Main Memory (RAM):**
        *   Located close to the CPU.
        *   Consists of semiconductor chips.
        *   Offers high-speed access.
        *   Used for *temporary* storage (data is lost when power is off).
    *   **Auxiliary Storage Device (Secondary Storage):**
        *   Accessed at a lower speed (often involves mechanical parts).
        *   Offers high storage density and is moderately priced.
        *   Examples: Hard disks, Solid State Drives (SSDs), magnetic tapes.
        *   Used for *permanent* storage.

3.  **Input/Output (I/O) Devices**
    *   Tools for interaction between users and computers.
    *   **Input devices:** Mouse, keyboard, microphone.
    *   **Output devices:** Monitor, printer, speakers.

**How Components Connect:**
These components (CPU, Memory, I/O Devices) are interconnected via a **System Bus**, which allows them to communicate and transfer data.

### 3. Types of Computer Architecture

Two primary architectures define how computers manage instructions and data.

1.  **Von Neumann Architecture**
    *   **Principle:** Applies the "stored-program" design, meaning programs and data are stored together in a single memory unit.
    *   **Operation:** The CPU reads commands (instructions) and reads/writes data from the *same* memory.
    *   **Limitation:** Instructions and data *cannot be accessed simultaneously* because they share the same signal bus and memory. This can create a "bottleneck" slowing down performance.
    *   **Advantage:** Simpler bus system design.

2.  **Harvard Architecture**
    *   **Principle:** Separates instruction memory and data memory.
    *   **Operation:** The CPU can read instructions from instruction memory and read/write data from data memory *in parallel*.
    *   **Advantage:** Solves the Von Neumann bottleneck by improving performance through simultaneous access to instructions and data.
    *   **Limitation:** The bus system design becomes more complex due to separate paths.

**Hybrid Architecture (Modern Approach)**
*   High-performance CPUs often combine both architectures to leverage their advantages.
*   **Internal (CPU & Cache):** Applies the **Harvard architecture** by separating cache memory for instructions and data. This allows the CPU to fetch instructions and data simultaneously from fast cache memory.
*   **External (CPU & Main Memory):** Applies the **Von Neumann architecture** for communication with the main memory, which holds both instructions and data in a unified space.

### 4. Central Processing Unit (CPU) Details

**A) Definition of CPU:**
The CPU is the most crucial part of a computer. It's responsible for interpreting program instructions, performing arithmetic and logical operations, and managing data processing. It's the "brain" that runs programs and processes information.

**B) CPU Execution Cycle:**
The CPU follows a specific sequence of steps to execute instructions:

1.  **Instruction Fetch:** Reads the next instruction from memory.
2.  **Instruction Decode:** Interprets the fetched instruction to determine what action needs to be taken.
3.  **Data Fetch (if necessary):** If the instruction requires data, the CPU reads that data from memory or an I/O unit.
4.  **Data Processing (if necessary):** Performs arithmetic or logical operations on the data as instructed.
5.  **Data Storage (if necessary):** Stores the results of the execution back into memory or sends them to an I/O unit.

**C) CPU Components:**
A CPU typically consists of the following key units:

*   **Control Unit (CU):** Directs and coordinates operations within the CPU, managing the flow of data and instructions.
*   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs all arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
*   **Registers:** Small, very fast storage locations within the CPU used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the CPU is currently working on.
*   **Buses:** Internal pathways within the CPU that transport data between its components.

Overview  of System  Architecture
>> Recent  trends and issues
In computer  engineering,  computer  architecture is a conceptual  design and the operational structure  that
is the basis for computer  systems.  It is a blueprint  that functionally  describes  the design portability  and
requirements  (especially  speed and interconnection)  of various parts of a computer. It mainly focuses  on
how the central processing  unit (CPU) performs  and accesses  memory  addresses  internally.
Modern computer  structures  are based on the Von Neumann  architecture,  and the basic instruction
processing  structure  has not changed  much. Though parallel processing  and other technologies have
improved  in their performance,  only recently  have new concepts,  such as neuromorphic  chips and quantum
computers,  been introduced.

John Doe, who works for company  A, is a software  engineer  with four years of development  experience.
Java is the programming  language  he generally  uses, but he was recently  given a task that required him
to program  using C. Since the Java language  managed  memory  in a runtime  environment,  called the Java
Virtual Machine  (JVM), it was not necessary  to pay much attention  to memory  during programming,  When
developing  with the C language,  he had to leam the concept  of memory,  such as memory  allocation  and
retum. Most importantly,  he had to learn the memory  address  system through  pointers.  He had to be
familiar  with computer  structure  to be able to develop  software  in C effectively.  This chapter  describes  the
computer  structure  in detail.
01 Computer  Structure  and Architecture
A) Basic computer  structure
The basic function of a computer  is to run a program  code in the specified  sequence.  In other words, it reads,
processes,  and stores the needed  data. [Figure 30] shows the main components  of a computer.
+ Central Processing  Unit (CPU): Also, commonly  known as a processor,  it plays a key role of the program  running  and
data processing.
+ Memory:
- Main memory:  Closely located to the CPU, it consists  of memory  semiconductor  chips. It can be accessed  at a
high speed and can be used only as temporary  storage  because  it has no permanent  storage  capabilities.
- Auxiliary  storage device: The secondary  storage device can be accessed  at a low speed because  it includes
mechanical  devices.  It has a high storage  density,  and it is moderately  priced. Disks and magnetic  tapes are some
examples.

B) Types of computer  architecture
The types of computer  architecture  include the von Neumann  architecture,  which is a structure  that applies the
stored-program  design principle'  , suggested  by von Neumann  in 1945, and the Harvard  architecture  which separates
instruction  memory  and data memory.  As shown in [Figure 31], these two types have different  memory  structures,
and each has advantages  and disadvantages.
+ Von Neumann  architecture:  The CPU can read commands  from the memory  and can read and write data both from
the memory  and to the memory.  Instructions  and data cannot be accessed  simultaneously  because  they use the
same signal bus and memory.
+ Harvard architecture:  It solves computer  bottlenecks  by storing commands  and data in different memories  and
improves  performance  by reading  and writing commands  in parallel. However,  the bus system design becomes
complex.
