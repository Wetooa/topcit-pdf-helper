## Information Security Learning Guide (Pages 55-59)

### I. Advanced Attack Techniques

These are methods attackers use to compromise systems:

*   **Drive-by Download Attack**
    *   **What it is:** Malware automatically infects a user's PC just by visiting a malicious website, without the user's knowledge or action.
    *   **How it spreads:** Malicious websites, often those accessed by many users (acting as an attack medium).
    *   **Impact:** Can cause secondary damage like DDoS attacks, spam email sending, or personal information theft, often without the user realizing.

*   **"Fileless" Attack**
    *   **What it is:** Attacks systems without installing new files or traditional malware executables.
    *   **How it works:** Primarily exploits web browser vulnerabilities when a user clicks a malicious link. Leverages built-in Windows tools like:
        *   **PowerShell:** A scripting language for system management.
        *   **WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command):** A Windows management command-line tool.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard for antivirus software to detect because no new software is installed.

*   **Malvertising (Malware + Advertising)**
    *   **What it is:** Distributing malware through legitimate online advertising networks or websites.
    *   **How it works:** Malware is subtly inserted into online ads.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Online advertising is an ideal channel because it appears on high-traffic sites, attracts user attention, and links to numerous websites, allowing widespread malware distribution without directly hacking each site.

### II. Security Trends in Latest Information Technology

#### A. IoT (Internet of Things) Security

**1. Overview**
*   **Importance:** Security is fundamental for IoT because more connected devices mean more attack targets.
*   **High Stakes:** Breaches in critical IoT services (healthcare, industrial control) can lead to physical injury, not just economic damage.
*   **Privacy Risk:** Connecting everyday objects increases concerns about personal information leakage and privacy invasion.
*   **Lifecycle Approach:** Security and privacy must be considered from the *design and development* phase through *deployment, operation, and destruction* of IoT devices and services.

**2. Applying Security in Design/Development**
*   **Security by Design:**
    *   **Considerations:** Account for IoT devices' low power/performance.
    *   **Core Principles:** Ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity/authentication**, and **availability**.
    *   **Key Measures:** Manage device access rights, implement end-to-end communication security, and use proven, standard security technologies.
    *   **Technology:** Actively integrate both software and hardware security.
*   **Privacy by Design:**
    *   **Default Protection:** Privacy protection methods should be built-in by default for IoT devices and services.
    *   **Data Handling:** For collected privacy information, use **encrypted transmission**, **anonymous storage**, and **integrity/authentication**.
    *   **Service Features:** Include **de-identification**, **access control/authentication**, **confidentiality**, and **secure storage** for privacy data within the service.
    *   **Transparency:** Providers must clearly show users how their privacy information is used (scope, period).

**3. Secure Software (S/W) and Hardware (H/W) Development**
*   **Secure Coding:**
    *   Apply secure coding practices from the source code phase to prevent vulnerabilities.
    *   Use language-specific guides (e.g., Java, C/C++) or international standards and analysis tools for other languages.
*   **Software Security Verification:**
    *   Verify all software used against known vulnerabilities.
    *   Apply security patches and follow guidelines for countermeasure verification.
*   **Secure Hardware Devices:**
    *   IoT devices are vulnerable (e.g., side-channel attacks, firmware/key extraction) due to their exposed environments.
    *   **Measures:** Implement firmware/code encryption, execution code domain control, and reverse engineering prevention techniques, tailored to the device's application environment.
*   **Converging S/W and H/W Security:**
    *   Create a secure channel (based on trusted authentication) between software and hardware security components.
    *   Ensure **confidentiality** and **integrity** of transmitted data.

**4. Security by System Component for IoT Services**
*   **IoT Network:** Apply security specific to the communication/network access protocols used.
*   **Dedicated IoT Protocol:** Eliminate vulnerabilities in protocol linking. Apply security requirements for standardized IoT data transmission protocols.
*   **IoT Platform:** Follow security requirements defined by established standard organizations.
*   **Service Model:** Apply diverse security requirements and legal/regulatory compliance for each unique service.

#### B. Cloud Security

**1. Overview**
*   **Core Concerns:** The unknown exact location of data and its accumulation in the cloud, especially in public clouds.
*   **Adoption Barrier:** Doubts about the reliability and stability of storing sensitive data on external cloud infrastructure hinder widespread cloud adoption.

**2. Threats of Cloud Security**
*   **Hypervisor Infection:** If the hypervisor (which manages virtual machines) is compromised, all virtual machines (VMs) running on it can be damaged.
*   **Attack Against Virtual Machine:** Interconnected VMs create internal attack paths, allowing attackers to perform packet sniffing, hacking, DDoS attacks, or spread malware between VMs.
*   **Attacker Tracking Difficulty:** Traditional network security tools (firewall, IPS, IDS) struggle to detect and trace attacks within the virtualized cloud environment.
*   **Portability of Virtual Machine:** VMs can be easily moved between physical platforms. If an infected VM is moved, malware can spread rapidly to other platforms.

**3. Countermeasures Against Cloud Security Threats**
*   **Protecting Incoming/Outgoing Data:** Use secure protocols like TLS, SSH, or VPN to maintain the confidentiality of data sent to and from cloud servers.
*   **Encrypting Stored Data:** Encrypt data *before* storing it in cloud storage. Use strong cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
*   **Access and Authentication:**
    *   Implement robust access and authentication mechanisms.
    *   Change administrator passwords regularly.
    *   Establish and enforce strict access control policies, such as 2-factor authentication.
*   **Securing Independence Between VMs:**
    *   Utilize virtual network security to protect against threats to shared repositories and networks.
    *   Ensure complete isolation between user-accessed VMs.
*   **Attack and Intrusion Detection:**
    *   **Hypervisor-type detection:** Analyzes the internal state of each VM via the hypervisor to detect intrusions.
    *   **VM-type detection:** An agentless virtual security detection technique.

#### C. Big Data Security

**1. Overview**
*   **Increased Risk:** Rapid big data adoption leads to massive collection and concentration of customer information, increasing personal information leakage risk.
*   **Sensitive Data:** Big data often includes highly sensitive information (credit, location, behavior).
*   **Impact of Breach:** A leakage incident will have an inevitably enlarged scope and scale.
*   **Priority:** Security is crucial for big data adoption (especially in finance).
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Secure management is essential throughout the entire big data lifecycle, from collection to destruction.

**2. Security Threat and Response by Big Data Lifecycle Phase**
*   **Big Data Collection Phase:**
    *   **Consent & De-identification:** For specific individuals' data, de-identify personal information if legal consent is not obtained.
    *   **Active Collection (e.g., Chukwa, Scribe, Flume):** Require data owner consent and apply access controls.
    *   **Passive Collection (e.g., Web Robot, Web Crawler):** Comply with robot exclusion standards.
*   **Big Data Storage and Management Phase:**
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt data using techniques suitable for data distribution and replication.
    *   **Access Control:** Apply technical and physical access controls.
    *   **Filtering:** De-identify data through filtering before storage.
*   **Data Processing and Analysis Phase:**
    *   **De-identification:** Use anonymization techniques like K-anonymity, L-diversity, and differential privacy.
    *   **Sensitive Information:** Process sensitive information in an encrypted state (e.g., using order-preserving or operation-preserving encryption).
    *   **Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM):** Use PPDM and similar techniques to protect privacy during big data mining.

Information  security )
malware or e-mails for spear phishing  attacks using your distributed  e-mail addresses.  In addition,  it is
necessary  to change  the account  password  periodically,  because  hackers  can send e-mails  for spear phishing
to the recipients  saved in the e-mail address  book, if the e-mail account  is hacked.
+ Backing  up important  data regularly
Important  data should be backed up regularly  because  important  documents  and files cannot  be read or used
if encrypted  after infection  with ransomware.  Anti-virus  programs  may prevent  infection  with malware  or they
may remove  malware,  butthey  cannot  decrypt  the encrypted  documents.  Therefore, important  documents  or
files should be backed up regularly  to a separate  external  storage  device and stored in a safe place.
H) Drive by download  attack
Recently,  malware  is distributed  using a drive-by  download  method that infects the user PC with malware  as
soon as the user accesses  a malicious  web site while surfing  the web, instead  of attacking  a vulnerable  service
through a network.  Malware  distribution,  using the drive-by  download  method, can infect a user’s device
without  the user’s knowledge,  andit can infect multiple  users at the same time, using the web server accessed
by multiple  users as an attack medium.  The user PC infected  with malware  in this process  can cause secondary
damage,  such as the DDoS attack, spam e-mail sending, and theft of personal  information,  without  the user's
knowledge  in the same way.
|) “Fileless”  attack  without  malware  installation
Generally,  when an attached  file is executed  or a malicious  executable  file is clicked, an external attacker
invades the system and infects it with malware.  Fileless attacks do not execute  a file, but mainly use a
vulnerability  in a web browser  to infect malware  when a user clicks a link to a malicious  site. This attack
technique  uses PowerShell*,  which is installed  through  Windows  7, and command  utility (WMIC)**,  which is a
Windows  management  tool, to make an attack. Such an attack may be difficult  to detect using an anti-virus
tool because  software  is not installed  on the user’s PC.
* PowerShell:  A task-based  shell and scripting  language,  specifically  designed  for system management.
PowerShell  is used to easily control and automate  the management  of Windows  OS and application  programs.
** WMIC (Windows  Management  Instrumentation  Command):  A system command  input tool for Windows
management,  provided  by Windows.
J) Malvertising
Malvertising  is a compound  word of malware  and advertising.  Malvertising  is a technique  of distributing  malware
using online advertising.  The malvertising  technique  inserts malware  by spreading  advertising  into the normal
online advertising  network  or web site. Online advertising  provides  the best environmental  conditions  for
spreading  malware  because  it displays  the topics that can attract the attention  of visitors,  or it is posted on
the site with a high number  of visitors. In addition,  the risk of malware  infection  increases  exponentially  in
online advertising,  because  it is linked with numerous  normally  operated  websites  and can easily distribute
malware  in large quantities,  even if an attacker  does not directly  hack each website.

O2 Security  trends related  to the latest information  technology
A) loT security
@ Overview  on loT security
Security  is a core technology  that must be provided  to promote  loT technology  and to create new services.
As the number  of devices connected to the Internet  increases,  the number  of attack targets and threat
elements  also increase.  In particular,  security  technology  is indispensable  for loT devices and communication
technologies  that are applied  to healthcare  services  or industrial  facility  control services,  because  an injury can
occur beyond simple economic  damage, if the security  of the service is breached.  In addition,  when ordinary
things around us are connected  to the Internet,  the range of concerns  about personal  information  leakage  or
privacy invasion  increases.  It is also obvious  that the level of breach will increase  beyond  comparison  with the
present.
Security  and privacy  protection systems  should be considered  from the design and development  phase of the
loT device and service. In addition,  it should be possible  to block potential  security  threats in advance  in the
loT device deployment  and installation  phase. Potential  security  threats and vulnerabilities  should be checked,
and security  should be applied throughout  the entire lifecycle  of the loT device, such as the setup, operation,
and execution  phase, when the device is actually  used, and during  the destruction  phase.
