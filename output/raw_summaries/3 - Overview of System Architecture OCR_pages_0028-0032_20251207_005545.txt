## System Architecture Learning Guide

### 1. System Architecture: Classification by Application Program Provision

This section describes how application programs are structured and delivered.

#### 1.1 Multi-Region Distributed System Architecture

*   **Concept:** Databases are spread across multiple geographical regions.
*   **Challenge:** Difficult to manage data integrity; system configuration and management become complex.

#### 1.2 Client-Server Architecture

*   **Concept:** System functions are divided between **servers** (providing services) and **clients** (requesting/using services).
*   **Roles:**
    *   **Server:** Handles data management, business processes.
    *   **Client:** Manages presentation (what the user sees) and runs application programs.
*   **Pros:** Provides a convenient Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the client side.
*   **Cons:** Complex configuration, difficult development and management due to separation.
*   **Examples:** Games, chatting applications, FTP servers, terminal servers.

#### 1.3 Web System Architecture

*   **Concept:** **Server** runs application programs; **client** accesses services using a web browser.
*   **Common Components:**
    *   Web Server
    *   Web Application Server (WAS)
    *   Database Server
*   **Middleware:** Ensures stable performance and high program reusability.
*   **Evolution:** Initially for static web services, now supports rich GUI environments (due to HTML5 and PC performance improvements).
*   **Prevalence:** Most modern information systems use this architecture.
*   **Client Access:** Accessible from any device with a web browser (PC, mobile).

### 2. System Architecture: Classification by System Layer (or Tier)

This section classifies system components by their function and role.

#### 2.1 Layers vs. Tiers

*   **Layers:** Represent functions and rules from a **logical** point of view (e.g., OSI 7-layer model for networks).
*   **Tiers:** Represent functions and rules from a **physical** point of view.
*   **Relationship:** Similar concepts, often used interchangeably, but describe different perspectives.

#### 2.2 Logical Information System Layers

Information systems are logically divided into these three layers:

*   **a. Presentation Layer (GUI / Front-End):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides service information and the user interface. It's the highest level.
    *   **Physical examples:** Web servers, client web browsers.
*   **b. Business Logic Layer (Transaction Tier):**
    *   **Purpose:** Runs programs that process business rules (business logic); determines data needs.
    *   **Physical examples:** Application program servers (like WAS).
*   **c. Data Layer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Accesses data resources (e.g., databases) to read or write data.
    *   **Sub-layers (optional):** Can be divided into a data access layer and a data store layer.
    *   **Physical examples:** Database servers, file systems.

#### 2.3 Physical N-Tier Architectures

These are physical implementations of the logical layers.

#### 2.3.1 Two-Tier Architecture

*   **Structure:** Server stores and processes data; client processes both business logic and presentation.
*   **Similarity:** Generally the same structure as client-server architecture.
*   **Pros:** Fast and easy to implement for a small number of users.
*   **Cons:** Performance degrades with more users, poor scalability, reusability, and resource utilization.
*   **Examples:** Applications built with 4GL tools like PowerBuilder, Visual Basic, Delphi.

#### 2.3.2 Three-Tier Architecture (Multi-Tier Architecture)

*   **Purpose:** Developed to overcome the limitations of two-tier architecture.
*   **Structure:** Adds an intermediate tier specifically for **business logic processing** between the presentation tier and the data tier.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Flexible and scalable business logic.
    *   Improved security (client doesn't directly access the database).
    *   Easier user authority management.
    *   Flexible distribution of the presentation tier.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Complex development environment.
    *   Increased cost (requires middleware and additional hardware).

### 3. Server's Stack Architecture

This section describes the structure of a server and its historical evolution.

#### 3.1 Server Concept & Evolution

*   **Definition:** A computer or program that provides information or services to users over a network. It supplies computing power for information systems.
*   **Mainframe Era (IBM):**
    *   **Concept:** Large, expensive, proprietary systems where one enterprise made all components (CPU, OS, language, applications).
    *   **Characteristics:** Excellent stability and performance.
*   **Downsizing (1997 onwards):**
    *   **Trend:** Mainframes began being replaced by more cost-effective "super Unix servers" (e.g., HP, Sun, Silicon Graphics, often with Power CPUs).
    *   **Shift:** Rise of servers using Intel CPUs (e.g., Windows NT servers).
*   **Current Market (Post-2017):**
    *   **Dominance:** x86 servers (featuring Intel CPUs) dominate the market, accounting for over 70% of server units sold.
    *   **Division:** Market divided into x86 servers and non-x86 servers.

#### 3.2 Server Stack Structure

Servers are built in layers, from hardware up to applications:

1.  **Computer Hardware (Bottom Layer):**
    *   Includes CPU, main memory, and auxiliary memory.
2.  **Operating System (OS):**
    *   Located above hardware.
    *   Abstracts hardware and provides services to software.
3.  **Middleware/Platform:**
    *   Located above the OS.
    *   Examples: Web server, Web Application Server (WAS), Database Management System (DBMS) server.
    *   **Purpose:** Supports flexible expansion, reduces dependency of application programs on specific computer hardware.
4.  **Application Program (Top Layer):**
    *   Provides services directly to users, utilizing the middleware below it.

#### 3.3 Brief History of Computer Hardware

*   **Early Concepts:** Turing Machine (1936) by Alan Turing, proving mathematical concepts.
*   **First Programmable General-Purpose Computer:** ENIAC (1946)
    *   **Characteristics:** Used 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 30 tons, as large as a house.
*   **First Stored-Program Computer:** EDSAC (1949)
    *   **Concept:** Embedded programs in a memory unit (based on John von Neumann's proposal).
*   **Popularization (1980s):**
    *   Driven by the success of IBM Personal Computers (PCs) and Microsoft's Windows operating system.
*   **Recent Era:** Rise of mobile computing with smartphones (handheld computers).

C) Classification  according  to how the application  programs  are provided
@ Client-server  architecture
The architecture  places system functions  in the servers and clients and configures  them to use the service,
depending  on the business  size or environment.  The server and client's role differs, depending  on where the
system functions,  such as data management,  business  processes,  and presentation,  are located. It can provide
the convenience  of a graphical  user interface  by running  the application  program  from the client side. However,  the
configuration  is complex,  and the development  and management  are difficult because  the architecture  is separated
into servers  and clients. Service  types include  games, chatting,  messenger,  FTP servers,  and terminal  servers.

The architecture  runs the server's application  programs,  and the client uses the service with a web browser. It
generally  consists
performance,  andof a webserver,  a web application  server, and a database  server. The middleware  assures stable
the program  reusability is high. Although  the web system architecture  was limited by only
providing  web services  with a static display, the introduction  of HTML5, and the performance  enhancement  of PC
environments,  have enabled  them to provide services  in an impressive  GUI environment.  Most recent information
systems  use websystem architecture.  The client can use all the services  with a PC or mobile device, if the
environment  runs a web browser.

D) Classification  by system  layer
The function  and role of each system component  are classified  by tier, or layer The most widely known layer is the
OSI 7 layer, which shows the network  structure.  Layers and tiers are considered  similar  concepts  because  they both
represent  functions and rules in a tiered structure.  The most common  difference  is that layers refer to structures
from a logical point of view, and tiers refer to structures  from a physical  perspective.  An information  system  is divided
into a presentation ayer, a business  logic layer, and a data layer. This logical layer architecture  can be divided into an
N-tier structure  as a physical system architecture.  The typical N-tier structures  are a two-tier  structure  and a three-
tier structure.
Type
Presentation  layerDescription
This layer is at the highest  level of an application  program.  It provides  the service information  and the
interface  to users. This layer is also called GUI or front-end.  In a physical  tier structure,  webservers  and
client's  web browsers  belong  to this layer.
Business  logic layerThis layer runs the program  information  processing  rules that fulfill business  requirements  (business  logic).
It determines  which data is needed  according  to the business  logic, and it refers them to the data tier.
This layer is called the transaction  tier. In a physical  tier structure,  application  program  servers,  such as
WAS, belong to this layer.
Data layerThis layer accesses  data resources,  such as the database,  and reads or writes data. The data layer may
be divided into the data access layer and the data store layer. In a physical  tier structure,  the database
server  or file system  belongs  to this layer.

client. It is generally  the same structure  as the client-server  architecture.  Since the client processes  most logic, it
can be fast and easily implemented  when the number  of users is small. However,  the performance  becomes  poor
as the number  of users increases,  and the architecture  is disadvantageous  in terms of scalability,  reusability,  and
resource  use. Actual cases include application implemented  with 4GL tools, such as PowerBuilder,  Visual Basic, and
Delphi.
