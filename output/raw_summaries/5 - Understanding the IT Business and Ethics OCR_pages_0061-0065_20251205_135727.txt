## IT BUSINESS OUTSOURCING & PROCESS INNOVATION: Learning Guide

### Section 1: IT Business Outsourcing

#### A. Adoption Process
When a company decides to outsource IT functions, the process typically involves these phases:

1.  **Preparation Phase:**
    *   Identify your company's core competencies.
    *   Select specific IT tasks or operations to be outsourced.
2.  **Selection Phase:**
    *   Choose the best outsourcing vendor/company.
3.  **Negotiation & Contracting Phase:**
    *   Negotiate terms and sign a contract.
    *   **Crucial Point:** Achieve a clear agreement with the vendor on how **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** will be managed.
4.  **Control Phase:**
    *   Manage the contract and oversee performance.
    *   Continuously improve performance.
5.  **Transition & Implementation Phase:**
    *   Transfer necessary technology and build experience.
    *   Ensure clear handover management for a smooth transition.

#### B. Forms of IT Business Outsourcing
IT outsourcing can take four main forms, each with its own characteristics:

1.  **Total Outsourcing**
    *   **Description:** The entire IT functionality is handed over to a single vendor.
    *   **Pros:** Clear accountability, improved job handling efficiency.
    *   **Cons:** Lack of competition can lead to monopolistic issues.
2.  **Selective Outsourcing**
    *   **Description:** Specific functions or job units are subcontracted to multiple vendors.
    *   **Pros:** Competition among vendors can improve price and quality.
    *   **Cons:** Potential accountability issues if problems arise, difficulties communicating exact requirements to multiple vendors.
3.  **IT Subsidiary Company Outsourcing**
    *   **Description:** IT functionality is outsourced to a subsidiary company established specifically for IT services.
    *   **Pros:** Improved communication and unity due to a shared sense of solidarity among employees.
    *   **Cons:** Increased associated costs, risk to the parent company if the subsidiary is not profitable.
4.  **Co-Sourcing**
    *   **Description:** IT planning, strategy, and service activities are separated, often with the client and vendor sharing responsibilities.
    *   **Pros:** Advantages in rapidly evolving environments, can partially address issues of total outsourcing.
    *   **Cons:** May require coordination if there's a gap between strategy and performance.

#### C. Considerations When Adopting Outsourcing
Companies face various challenges during IT outsourcing. Key considerations include:

1.  **General Oversight:**
    *   **Continuous Oversight:** Essential to monitor the outsource vendor using standards like **eSCM** (e-Sourcing Capability Model) and **ISO/IEC 20000** (IT Service Management standard).
    *   **Security:** Establish robust security systems to prevent corporate information leakage.
    *   **Service Quality:** Continuously monitor and manage service levels to ensure optimal quality.
    *   **BPO (Business Process Outsourcing):** If an entire business process (or a significant part) is outsourced, adopt BPO.

2.  **Specific Issues & Solutions (Table Summary):**

| Category    | Common Problems                                        | Key Considerations/Solutions                                                                                                        |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Management** | Weak control over subcontractors, increased vendor dependency, inter-company disputes, higher management costs. | Set up a control system using IT governance. Evaluate from a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) viewpoint. Use evaluation systems like eSCM/ISO20000. |
| **Contracts** | Unclear scope and Roles & Responsibilities (R&R), uncertain estimated costs, difficulty awarding bonuses/sanctions. | Use **Service Level Agreements (SLA)** for clear level agreement and management. Plan for change management. Adopt systematic cost estimation methods. |
| **Operations** | Security concerns for corporate information, difficulty accumulating internal know-how, insufficient fulfillment of requirements. | Implement a security training program and a security control system. Establish a technology transfer process. Set up a service quality system. |

### Section 2: Recent Trends & Process Improvement

#### A. Optimizing IT Business Processes
*   **Goal:** Companies must optimize IT business processes to respond quickly to environmental changes.
*   **Evolution:** Processes become more optimized over time, with changes in the business environment acting as a key factor.
*   **Identifying Issues:** Continuous monitoring of process **bottlenecks** is crucial for improvement.
*   **Solutions:** Companies use **BPR (Business Process Reengineering)** or **PI (Process Innovation)** to rectify bottleneck issues.

#### B. The Human Element in Process Innovation
*   **Challenge:** The most challenging aspect of BPR/PI is gaining the support and conviction of a company's own employees.
*   **Reason:** Employees are both the operators of processes and the subjects of any innovations.
*   **Success Factors:**
    *   Ceaseless persuasion.
    *   Creating an atmosphere where employees feel they can share in the company's growth.

### Section 3: Case Studies in Process Innovation

#### A. BPR Case Study: Starbucks
**Context:** In 2008, Starbucks faced a significant economic downturn and a more than 50% drop in sales.

**BPR Initiatives (Transformation Strategy):**
1.  **Leveraging Technology:** Integrated wireless technology and mobile digital platforms into its business.
2.  **Customer-Centric Innovations:**
    *   Customer analysis showed 1/3 of customers used smartphones.
    *   Introduced a smartphone app-based payment system (prepaid/rechargeable cards).
    *   Created "Starbucks Digital Network" with Yahoo, offering free Wi-Fi, Wall Street Journal articles, and iTunes music downloads.
3.  **Internal Process Efficiency (Lean Manufacturing Principles):**
    *   Formed a "Lean Team" to benchmark Toyota's lean manufacturing methods.
    *   Redesigned barista workstations to eliminate unnecessary bending.
    *   Minimized customer waiting times and reduced drink preparation time.
4.  **Employee Work Environment:**
    *   Built a smart work environment with wireless technology to maximize employee efficiency.
    *   Enabled employees to work from any store nationwide, increasing regional managers' store visit times by ~25%.

**Results:**
*   Significant cost savings through new operating methods and customer services.
*   Starbucks recovered its profitability and maintained growth.

#### B. PI Case Study: Korea Workers’ Compensation & Welfare Service (COMWEL)
**Context:** From 2010-2011, COMWEL undertook a large-scale Process Innovation (PI) project to build an advanced administration system.

**Keys to PI Success (for COMWEL and generally):**
*   **Company-Wide Consensus:** PI requires agreement from top management to working-level staff.
*   **Best Practices:** Application and full internalization of best practices within the organization.
*   **Systematic Management:** COMWEL's success became a benchmark for other public institutions, despite their conservative nature.

**Motivation:**
*   To achieve "job efficiencies through process innovation."
*   To improve the quality of public services despite limited human resources.

**COMWEL's PI Process:**
1.  **Internal Analysis:** Began with internal discussions to identify areas most in need of improvement.
2.  **Process Diagnosis:** Conducted "AS-IS" (current state) process diagnosis consulting.
3.  **Selection:** Studied end-to-end processes for each job and selected those requiring PI.
4.  **Requirements Gathering:** Identified and extracted requirements from the working level.
5.  **System Implementation:** Used gathered information to set up:
    *   **BPM (Business Process Management):** For managing business processes.
    *   **PKMS (Process-based Knowledge Management System):** For managing knowledge related to processes.
    *   **EID (Enterprise Information Display) system:** For displaying enterprise information.
6.  **Prioritization & Systemization:** Systemized 25 out of 50 core processes that were expected to yield the greatest impact.
7.  **Continuous Improvement Cycle:** PI was continuously performed through a framework of: Process Establishment → Monitoring → Improvement Activities → Process Establishment.

**Benefits/Results:**
*   **Improved Public Service:** Eliminated unnecessary procedures and simplified complex ones.
*   **Enhanced Information Access:** When users search for data, the system provides increasingly relevant information as data accumulates.
*   **Better Management:** Management could quickly identify business unit plans and core information, allowing for rapid modification of strategies and reduction of risks.

[Fig. 21] Conceptual  diagram  of IT business  outsourcing  adoption  process
When a company  opts for IT outsourcing,  it begins by identifying  its core competencies  and selecting  the tasks to be
outsourced.  Once the target  task has been selected,  the vendor  will be chosen,  and negotiations  will proceed  until a
contract  is signed. The most important  task is for the company  and the vendor  to reach a clear-cut  agreement  on
how the index for service levels will be managed.
C) Forms of outsourcing
IT business  outsourcing  can take one of four forms.
<Table 18> Forms  of IT business  outsourcing
Form
Total Outsourcing
Selective  Outsourcing
IT Subsidiary  Company
Outsourcing
Co-SourcingDescription
The entire IT functionality  is subcontracted  to a single vendor,  and the accountability  is clear cut
and the job handling  efficiency  can be improved.  But the absence  of competition  can give rise to
monopolistic  issues.
The selected  function  or job unit is subcontracted  to multiple  vendors. Price and quality
improvements  can be expected  from competition  among  vendors.  However,  accountability  issues
may arise when problems  occur, and there could be difficulties  when communicating  the exact
customer  requirements.
The IT functionality  is outsourced  to a subsidiary  company  specializing  in IT, which is established
solely for the purpose.  This is a form of outsourcing  that can yield benefits  like improved
communication  and unity by promoting  a sense of solidarity  among  employees.  However,
associated  costs could increase  and, if the subsidiary  is not profitable,  it could become  a risk to the
parent  company.
IT planning,  IT strategy,  and IT service  activities  are separated.  This is a form of adoption  that offers
advantages  in a rapidly  evolving  environment,  and the problems  of total outsourcing  can be partly
addressed.  However,  some coordination  may be required in the event of a gap between  strategy
and performance.
D) Considerations  when adopting  outsourcing
In the course of outsourcing  an IT business,  a company  will come across many types of problems.  To address  these
problems,  the following  steps could be considered:

>> Recent  trends and key issues
With the IT business  process,  it is important  for a company  to optimize  the process in order to respond
quickly to changes  in its environment.  After the initial set-up, a process becomes  optimized  with the
passage  of time, with changes  in the business  environment  playing an important  role as an optimizing
factor.
To improve  the IT business  process on a continuous  basis, it is critical to monitor  bottlenecks  in the
process.  Companies  in this situation  usually  turn to BPR or PI to rectify ...
