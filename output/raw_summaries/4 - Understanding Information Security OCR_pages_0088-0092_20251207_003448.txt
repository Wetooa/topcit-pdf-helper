## Database Security Learning Guide

This guide covers essential concepts, threats, countermeasures, and encryption methods for database security.

### 1. Database Security Threats & Countermeasures

#### 1.1 Common Database Security Threats

*   **Illegal Information Acquisition:** Unauthorized access to data, often via:
    *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code.
    *   **Web Shell Execution:** Uploading and running malicious files.
*   **Vulnerable Identification & Authentication:**
    *   **Repetitive Authentication Attempts:** Brute-forcing passwords or user IDs.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into revealing credentials.
*   **Data Leakage:**
    *   Stealing unencrypted data.
    *   Decrypting improperly encrypted data.
*   **Misuse of Cryptographic Modules:**
    *   Using unreliable encryption modules.
    *   Applying inappropriate cryptographic modes.

#### 1.2 Countermeasures Against Database Security Threats

*   **Access Controls:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow only authorized users, prevent unauthorized access to the database itself.
    *   **Methods:** Account management, MAC, DAC, RBAC (explained below).
*   **Views:**
    *   **Goal:** Limit access to specific, permitted data within the database.
    *   **Method:** Use `CREATE VIEW` to define virtual tables.
*   **Encryption:**
    *   **Goal:** Protect sensitive data by storing it in an unreadable format.
    *   **Algorithms:**
        *   **One-way Ciphers (Hashing):** For passwords (e.g., SHA-256).
        *   **Two-way Ciphers:** For other sensitive data (e.g., SEED, AES).

### 2. Database Access Control

Access control policies define how users can interact with database objects.

#### 2.1 Database Access Control Policies

*   **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):**
    *   **Concept:** Access is based on the *subject's identity* or group membership.
    *   **Control:** The *object owner* determines who has access.
    *   **Example:** A table owner can grant or revoke privileges to other users.
*   **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):**
    *   **Concept:** Access is based on the *owner's rights* to confidential objects. A central authority sets rules.
    *   **Control:** The system enforces strict security labels/clearances.
    *   **Example:** Only a Database Administrator (DBA) can access the system catalog.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   **Concept:** Access is based on a user's *role* within the organization.
    *   **Control:** A central administrator defines roles and assigns privileges to those roles, then assigns users to roles.
    *   **Example:** Defining "DBA" roles and granting specific privileges to users assigned to the DBA role.

#### 2.2 Methods of Controlling Access to the Database

These methods dictate how access control is implemented physically.

*   **Agent Method:**
    *   **How it works:** An "agent" (software module for access control and logging) is installed directly on the *database server*. Users access via a dedicated client.
    *   **Pros:** Strong access control.
    *   **Cons:** Can degrade database server performance due to traffic overhead.
*   **Gateway Method (Proxy Server):**
    *   **How it works:** All connection requests to the database server pass through a separate "database access control server" (a proxy).
    *   **Pros:** Most powerful access control; can be configured for redundancy (ensuring continuity even if one server fails).
    *   **Cons:** Can be a single point of failure if not redundant.
*   **Network Sniffing Method:**
    *   **How it works:** Uses specialized equipment (like TAP) to *analyze and log network packets* between clients and the database. It doesn't actively block or control.
    *   **Pros:** No agents or load on the database server/network; no system modifications needed.
    *   **Cons:** Cannot *fundamentally block* damage to data integrity from improper alterations; primarily a monitoring tool.
*   **Hybrid Method:**
    *   **How it works:** Combines multiple methods (e.g., Agent + Gateway, Gateway + Network Sniffing) to leverage their strengths and mitigate individual shortcomings.

### 3. Database Encryption

Protecting sensitive data within the database using cryptographic techniques.

#### 3.1 Considerations When Applying Database Encryption

*   **Encryption Target & Method:** Identify sensitive data (e.g., by law) and decide which encryption method to use.
*   **Cryptographic Algorithm:**
    *   Use algorithms recommended by security experts.
    *   **Passwords:** Always use strong *one-way* algorithms (hashing, e.g., SHA-256 or higher).
    *   **Other Information:** Use strong *two-way* algorithms (e.g., SEED, ARIA, AES).
*   **Search & Performance:** Encryption can impact database performance (e.g., indexing, search queries). Consider partial encryption for performance optimization.
*   **Encryption Key Management:** Securely manage encryption/decryption keys throughout their lifecycle (generation, storage, use, destruction).

#### 3.2 Target and Method of Database Encryption

Data requiring encryption is often defined by laws and regulations.

*   **Key Data Types for Encryption:** Passwords, biometric information, resident/foreign registration numbers, passport/driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, account numbers, transaction logs.

| Regulation/Category                 | Target Data                                                                                             | Encryption Method                                   |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Common**                          | Passwords                                                                                               | Storage after **one-way encryption** (hashing)      |
| **Personal Information Protection Act** | Passport numbers, Driver's license numbers, Foreign registration numbers, Resident registration numbers, Bio information | Storing after encryption with a **secure two-way cipher algorithm** |
| **Information & Comm. Network Act** | Resident registration numbers, Account numbers, Bio information                                        | Storing after encryption with a **secure two-way cipher algorithm** |
| **Electronic Financial Supervision Regulations** | Transaction logs                                                                                        | Storage after encryption                            |

#### 3.3 Types of Database Encryption (Implementation Methods)

*   **API Method:**
    *   **How it works:** The encryption/decryption module is installed *inside the application program server*. The application explicitly calls API functions to encrypt/decrypt data.
    *   **Data Flow:** Data is transmitted *encrypted* between the application server and the database server.
    *   **Pros:** Low load on the database server.
    *   **Cons:** Requires *modification of application programs*; potentially higher load on the application server.
    *   **Recommended When:** Application programs are easy to modify, and database server performance is poor.
*   **Plug-in Type:**
    *   **How it works:** The encryption/decryption module is installed *inside the database server*. It intercepts requests and encrypts/decrypts data as it's written/read.
    *   **Data Flow:** Data is exchanged in *plain text* between the application server and the database server *before encryption and after decryption*.
    *   **Pros:** No modification required for application programs.
    *   **Cons:** Can create a load on the database server.
    *   **Recommended When:** Database performance is good, and application programs are difficult/impossible to modify.
*   **TDE Method (Transparent Data Encryption):**
    *   **How it works:** Uses the *built-in or optional encryption/decryption function of the Database Management System (DBMS) itself*.
    *   **Data Flow:** Encryption/decryption is performed at the *DBMS kernel level*.
    *   **Pros:** No application program modification needed.
    *   **Cons:** Support depends entirely on the DBMS type and version; may not be available.
    *   **Recommended When:** Introducing a new DBMS that supports TDE.

#### 3.4 Applying Database Encryption (One-Way Cipher)

*   **Application of a One-Way Cipher Algorithm (Hashing):**
    *   **Purpose:** To make it *impossible* to reverse-calculate the original data from the stored hash. Primarily used for passwords.
    *   **Algorithm:** Cryptographic hash functions, generally SHA-256 or higher.
    *   **When to Apply/Migrate:**
        1.  When existing database data is stored in plain text.
        2.  When insecure hash algorithms (like MD5 or SHA-1) are currently in use.

@ Agent  method
A method of accessing  a database,  using a dedicated  client for database  access, after installing  an agent
with the access control and logging function in the database  server itself. This method  can implement  strong
access  control,  but it can cause performance  degradation  of the database  server, due to the traffic therein.

@ Gateway  method
A method  of passing  all database  server  connection  requests  through  the database  access  control server (proxy
server). This method provides  the most powerful  access control function.  As the database  access control
server can be configured  in redundancy,  work is not affected,  even when  a failure  occurs.
