### Section 1: Effective Presentations

Mastering presentations involves preparation, non-verbal communication, practice, and audience engagement.

#### A. Preparation for On-Site Presentations

Ensure a smooth and impactful presentation by focusing on these pre-event checks:

*   **Venue Inspection:**
    *   Visit the venue in advance.
    *   Visualize the audience seating.
    *   Practice your movement, gestures, and a simple run-through.
*   **Material Familiarity:**
    *   Know your presentation material's sequence and flow by heart.
    *   Avoid reading from slides; this reduces confidence and eye contact, making the presentation boring.
    *   Maintain a natural flow, even without relying on notes.
*   **Opening Comments:**
    *   Start with a brief, interesting story related to current events, weather, or a relatable topic.
    *   This creates a comfortable atmosphere and captures audience interest, preventing a rigid start.
*   **Material Review:**
    *   Proofread your presentation material for errors.
    *   Bring your own laptop as a backup; display styles can vary based on software versions or fonts.
*   **Key Points & Examples:**
    *   Double-check the main points for each slide.
    *   Verify that examples used to clarify concepts are relevant and well-connected.
    *   Utilize presentation tools or a simple cue sheet for support.
*   **Closing Comments:**
    *   Prepare a memorable closing message.
    *   Link the closing directly to your presentation's subject to reinforce key takeaways.
    *   Consider using relevant quotes or aphorisms.

#### B. Using Body Language Effectively

Non-verbal communication is crucial for persuasion and credibility.

*   **Mehrabian's Law:** In communication, 93% of persuasion comes from non-verbal cues (gestures, tone of voice), while only 7% comes from logical explanation. Body language includes voice.
    *   **ESSENCE:** Facial expression, gesture; Intonation, tone, accent; Content of speech.
*   **Personal Appearance & Image:**
    *   Maintain a neat appearance, hairstyle, and attire.
    *   A smiling, positive demeanor fosters trust and a good impression. Avoid looking gloomy or stiff.
*   **Eye Contact:**
    *   Maintain clear, bright, confident eye contact.
    *   Focus about 60% of your gaze on key decision-makers and 40% on the rest of the audience.
    *   Observe reactions and build a connection.
*   **Voice:**
    *   Use correct pronunciation and an appropriate speaking speed.
    *   A resonant voice enhances delivery.
    *   Vary your speaking speed (slow, fast, pauses) to keep the audience engaged.
*   **Appropriate Motion:**
    *   Use subtle hand movements to emphasize important points.
    *   Avoid exaggerated motions, which can be distracting.
*   **Gestures for Emphasis:**
    *   Make gestures *at the same time* or *slightly before* your verbal emphasis.
    *   Combine hand gestures with eye contact and vocal emphasis for maximum impact.

#### C. Scenarios & Rehearsals (Practice)

*   **Scenario:** Simulate how you will use your allotted time, including when to deliver specific messages.
*   **Rehearsal:**
    *   Practice your message delivery, ideally with slide notes.
    *   Rehearse 1-2 times, imagining an audience is present.

#### D. Relaxing Tension Before Starting

Tension is a major barrier to effective presentations.
*   **Strategies to Reduce Tension:**
    *   Repetitively clench and unclench your fists.
    *   Practice deep belly breathing (inhale deeply, exhale slowly).
    *   Arrive at the venue early to settle in.
    *   Rehearse more to boost confidence.
    *   Engage in a casual chat with a colleague before starting.
    *   Use positive self-talk: "It's okay to make a mistake," "I'm okay."

#### E. First Greeting

A strong opening greeting sets a relaxed tone for your entire presentation.
*   **Effective Greeting:**
    *   Start with a brief greeting ("Good morning.").
    *   Receive applause.
    *   Then, make eye contact with the audience and introduce yourself.
    *   Avoid lengthy introductions before bowing or receiving acknowledgment.

#### F. Responding to Audience Reactions

Presentations aim to connect, communicate, and influence decisions. Monitor your audience continuously.

*   **Monitor:** Adjust your voice tone, speed, content, emphasis, and story transitions based on real-time audience feedback.
*   **Audience Reactions:**
    | Positive Response       | Negative Response      |
    | :---------------------- | :--------------------- |
    | Eye contact             | Folded arms            |
    | Nodding                 | Distracted gaze        |
    | Leaning forward         | Slouching              |
    | Smiling                 | Reading handout        |
    | Focused look            | Distracted look        |
*   **Action for Negative Reactions:** If you notice negative reactions, quickly:
    *   Transition to another part of your story.
    *   Use humor to lighten the mood.
    *   Adjust your speech tone and speed to regain attention.
    *   It's vital to track and control the situation during the presentation.

portant  question,  it may lead to poor outcomes.  Likewise,  the important  points for on-site  presentation  are as
follows.
+ Preliminary  Inspection  of the Presentation  Venue
It is necessary  to look around the presentation  venue in advance,  visualize  a scene in which the audience  is
seated,  and simulate  the range of motion,  gestures,  and a simple practice  of presentation.
+ Be familiar  with the order of presentation  material
Check whether  you are familiar  with the sequence  and flow of the presentation  material.  Glancing  over at
the material  while speaking  may often make you look less confident  because  you do not make eye contact
with the audience,  which may undermine  credibility  in what you say, and make the presentation  itself boring.
Therefore, you should always be familiar  with the order of the presentation  material  and maintain  a natural
flow so that you can continue  your presentation  even without  reading  the material.
+ Appropriate  and Interesting  Opening  Comments
You should start your presentation  with a story that can relate to topics such as simple weather,  current
status, and recent issues, and that can arouse the audience's  interest.  If you go straight  into the topic
from the beginning,  the atmosphere  may become  rigid and the relationship  between  the presenter  and
the audience  may become  awkward.  It's okay to talk lightly, so prepare  a comment  that can help create a
comfortable  atmosphere  of the first encounter  with the audience.
+ Presentation  Material  Review
Check the prepared  presentation  material  for any errors. Since the style in which the prepared  material is
displayed  may vary depending  on the version  or font of the presentation  tool software,  it is recommended  to
bring with a laptop, etc. to be ready for an unexpected  situation.
+ Key points of each sheet and appropriate  examples  to promote  understanding
Check the key points to be presented  for each sheet once again, and whether  the cases prepared  to promote
better understanding  are well connected.  It is also good to make good use of presentation  tools or prepare  a
simple cue sheet.
+ Impressive  closing  comments
At the end of the presentation,  prepare  a closing comment  so that you can leave an impressive  message  to
your audience.  It is also good to use aphorisms  or quotes related to the contents  of the presentation, or  to
convey  impressively  the good words you saw in the book. The important  point is that the closing  comment  is
well linked to the subject  so that the subject  content  can be more deeply relatable.
B) Effective  use of body language
According  to The Law of Mehrabian,  93% of non-verbal  body language  such as gestures  and tone of voice is
used to persuade  the other person in actual communication.  The logical explanation  occupies  only 7%. Here,
body language  includes  voice.

ESSENCE
HE Facial expression,  gesture
[) Intonation,  tone, accent
Content  of speech
For example, we think that an actor with good voice is good at acting. No matter how well you act, if you
cannot  speak well, you may be seen as if you are not good at acting. How to effectively  use body language  in
your presentation  is as follows.
@ Personal  Appearance  and Image
Your appearance  and image is also very important  factor to win the audience's  trust. In order to make a good
impression,  you need to have a neat appearance,  hairstyle,  and attire. It is difficult to make a good impression
and look trustworthy  when you look messy. And you should have a smiling  face. If you are gloomy  or stiff, you
may present  a negative  image.
@ Eye-contact
You must keep your eyes clear and bright. Insecure  eye gaze cannot make you look confident  or trustworthy.
Eye contact  is a very effective  way to make a presentation  successful.  When giving a presentation,  it is most
important  to make eye contact  with the key people who make decisions.  Look at one person at a time, but
distribute  your visual attention  about 60% to the decision  maker and 40% to the rest of the audience.  It is
necessary  to observe  the other person's  reaction  and develop  a connection  through  “eye contact’,
© Voice
You must explain with correct  pronunciation  and appropriate  speed, and presenting  with a resonant  voice helps
to enhance  delivery. Rather than keeping  the speed of voice constant,  you should immerse  the audience  by
controlling  the speed such as making  it slow, fast, or a pause, etc.
@ Use appropriate  motion
Body language  is effective  to use when emphasizing  important  points. If you take too much exaggerated
motion,  you can make a negative  impression.  It's a good idea to use the proper hand movements  at the right
timing.

If you emphasize something  with your voice, and ma...
