## Network Protocols & System Architecture: A Learning Guide

This guide condenses essential information about network protocols and system architecture for easy learning.

### 1. What is a Protocol?

*   **Definition:** A standardized communication rule for sending and receiving data over a network.
*   **Purpose:** Ensures different devices (PCs, servers, routers) can understand and exchange data reliably.
*   **Standardization Bodies:**
    *   **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** Most Internet-related protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, HTTP).
    *   **3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) & 3GPP2:** Wireless communication protocols (e.g., GSM, LTE).
    *   **ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector):** Telephone-related protocols.
*   **Layered Operation:**
    *   **Physical Layer:** Directly interacts with hardware (wires, switches) using electrical signals.
    *   **Protocol Layers (above Data Link):** Implemented and operated in software.
    *   Understanding these layers is crucial for network software development.

### 2. OSI Reference Model and TCP/IP Protocol Layer Structure

Networking communication is often described using layered models.

#### 2.1 OSI Reference Model

*   **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection):** A conceptual model that standardizes communication functions.
*   **Layers:** 7 distinct layers, each responsible for specific tasks.

| Layer               | Example Protocols        | Function                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **7. Application**  | HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, FTP    | Provides services like user interfaces, email, database management.     |
| **6. Presentation** | JPEG, MPEG, XDR          | Handles data syntax, encoding translation, and encryption/decryption.   |
| **5. Session**      | TLS, SSH, RPC, NetBIOS   | Establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions.        |
| **4. Transport**    | TCP, UDP, SCTP           | Ensures reliable message transfer between end-to-end processes, error control. |
| **3. Network**      | IP, IPX, ICMP, ARP, OSPF | Supports packet transmission between networks (source to destination). |
| **2. Data Link**    | Ethernet, PPP, HDLC      | Manages physical addressing (MAC), error detection within a local network. |
| **1. Physical**     | PSTN, DSL, T1            | Transfers actual bits through physical media (cables, radio waves).     |

#### 2.2 TCP/IP Protocol Suite (ARPANET Reference Model)

*   A more practical, 4/5-layer model based on the ARPANET, predating OSI.
*   Combines some OSI layers for simplicity.

| TCP/IP Layers       | Corresponding OSI Layers   | Example Protocols               | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4. Application**  | Application, Presentation, Session | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP | Handles application-specific services and data formatting.                 |
| **3. Transport**    | Transport                  | TCP, UDP, SCTP                    | Manages data exchange between applications (ports); ensures reliability (TCP) or speed (UDP). |
| **2. Internet**     | Network                    | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP, OSPF | Handles addressing and routing of packets across different networks.       |
| **1. Network Interface** | Data Link, Physical        | Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), Frame Relay | Sends/receives TCP/IP packets over physical media; includes MAC functions. |

#### 2.3 Data Encapsulation (Headers)

*   **Concept:** As data travels down the layers (from Application to Physical), each layer adds its own header to the data received from the layer above. This process is called encapsulation.
*   **Purpose:** Each header contains information specific to that layer's function (e.g., port numbers for Transport, IP addresses for Network, MAC addresses for Data Link).
*   **Example Flow:**
    1.  **Application Layer:** User Data
    2.  **Transport Layer:** Adds `TCP Header` to User Data.
    3.  **Network Layer:** Adds `IP Header` to (TCP Header + User Data).
    4.  **Data Link Layer:** Adds `Ethernet Header` to (IP Header + TCP Header + User Data).
*   **Note:** Each layer only uses the header that corresponds to its function.

---

### 3. Internet Address System

Different layers use different addressing systems to identify communication endpoints.

#### 3.1 MAC Address (Medium Access Control Address)

*   **Layer:** Data Link Layer
*   **Purpose:** Transfers frames between physically connected nodes on the same local network.
*   **Nature:** A **physical address**, generally stored on the Network Interface Card (NIC) hardware. Also called Ethernet Hardware Address (EHA).
*   **Format:** 48 bits (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`)
    *   **First 24 bits:** Hardware manufacturer's unique ID.
    *   **Remaining 24 bits:** NIC-dependent address.

#### 3.2 IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)

*   **Layer:** Network Layer
*   **Purpose:** Transfers datagrams between two hosts/routers across multiple Internet networks (source to destination).
*   **Nature:** A **logical address**, assigned by network administrators.
*   **Versions:**
    *   **IPv4:** 32-bit address system (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). Facing exhaustion due to rapid Internet growth.
    *   **IPv6:** 128-bit address system (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). Introduced to solve IPv4 exhaustion, but IPv4 is still widely used.
*   **Allocation:** Currently managed by **ICANN (International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** (formerly IANA).

#### 3.3 Port Number

*   **Layer:** Transport Layer
*   **Purpose:** Transfers messages between specific processes (running applications) on two hosts. Identifies *which* application on a host should receive the data.
*   **Format:** 16-bit number system, identifying up to 65,535 application programs.
*   **Categories (IANA allocated):**
    *   **Well-Known Ports (0-1023):** Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP-80, FTP-21, SSH-22, SMTP-25, DNS-53).
    *   **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** Can be registered by companies/developers for specific applications (e.g., IRC-6667, Git-9418). Mostly used by servers.
    *   **Dynamic/Temporary Ports (49152-65535):** Used by clients as temporary source ports when initiating connections.

### 4. Internet Standardization Organizations

These organizations define and maintain the standards that enable global network communication.

01 What is the Protocol?
<Table 1> above showed many standard  protocols,  such as ARP, IP TCP, HTTP, DNS, and NAT. A protocol is a
standardized  communication  rule for sending  and receiving  data through  a network. The Internet,  as we know, is a
large group of networks  that connect  multiple  PCs and servers.
For tens or hundreds  of thousands  of PCs, servers, and routers that connect  them to exchange  data, it is necessary
to have a common  protocol  that can be found by each other, and there are several international  organizations  that
standardize  these protocols.
+ IETF (Internet  Engineering  Task Force) is responsible  for most Internet-related  standard  protocols.
+ 3GPP (Third Generation  Partnership  Project)  and 3GPP2 are responsible  for wireless  communication  protocols  such
as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, LTE, and LTE-A.
+ ITU-T (International  Telecommunication  Union Telecommunication  Standardization  Sector) is responsible  for
protocols  related to telephones.
Therefore,  it is necessary  to have the competitiveness  to understand  and implement  (if necessary)  the standard
protocols  enacted  by these standardization  organizations  to develop  software  in the network/communication  sector.
[Figure 12] below shows the details of [Figure 11] by reflecting  the network  protocol  concepts  described  above. When
a user searches  through  a web browser,  data requests  and response  data flow in the network  through  devices,  such
as the user’s computer,  a wired/wireless  router, a switching  hub, and a router, using the related protocols.  While the
physical layer is directly  connected  with hardware,  such as wires and switches,  and operates  with electric  signals, the
protocol  layer above the data link layer is implemented  and operated  in software.  Understanding  how many software
components  are connected  to each other for operation  should enable application  programs  or system  software  over
a network.  Later sections  describe  in detail how each protocol  layer shown in [Figure 12] works with the others in
each stage.

02 OSI Reference  Model and TCP/IP  Protocol  Layer Structure
[Figure 13] shows  the concept  of the OSI reference  model communication,  which includes  the open relay system
described  in the standard  document  ISO/IEC  7498-1:1994(E)  [8]. The diagram  is often used when discussing  ISO's OSI
reference  model, or OSI layer, which is commonly  referred  to when dealing  with networks.  Here, ISO is derived  from the
Greek word “iooc (isos)’, meaning  ‘identical’,  andshould not be confused  with the English name of the International
Organization  for Standardization  (IOS). OSI is an abbreviation  of Open Systems  Interconnection.

As shown in [Figure 5], the Internet  protocol layer is based on the ARPANET  reference  model, which was released
before the OSI layer model [3][9][10].  While documents  use slightly  different  terms for each layer, this section uses
the most commonly  used terms.
