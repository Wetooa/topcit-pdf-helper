## Learning Guide: Business & Technical Documentation

This guide covers essential aspects of business document quality, common documentation tools, and the fundamentals of technical documents.

### **Section 1: Business Document Quality & Tools**

#### 1.1 What is a Manual?
A **Manual** is a document that explains the details of a plan or product.

#### 1.2 Business Document Quality Checklist
To ensure high-quality business documents, a final inspection from an objective, third-party perspective is crucial. Use this checklist *after* writing your document to review it against requirements.

**Checklist for Business Documents:**
1.  Is the *need* for this report/proposal clearly described?
2.  Is it *easy to understand* for the ultimate reader?
3.  Does it answer "Why should I do this?" for the proposed plan?
4.  Are *alternatives* and their *pros and cons* well described?
5.  Are any alternatives missing? Are verbal answers prepared?
6.  Are sentences *concise and clear*? Avoid lengthy ones.
7.  Does the *title accurately represent* the content?
8.  Are there any *logical errors* in the table of contents?
9.  Are you prepared to answer "What specifically are you going to do?"?
10. Is it *understandable without explanation*?
11. Is it *visually appealing*? Does it use white space effectively?
12. Is there any concrete, intuitive, or logical gap?
13. Are there too many colors? Is the color conspicuous (distracting)?
14. Is the *evidence clear*? Has the source of supporting data been examined and described?

#### 1.3 Business Documentation Tools
Common commercial tools support various functions required for business documents. Knowing how to use them well is beneficial.

*   **Word Processors (e.g., HWP, MS Word):**
    *   **Purpose:** Creating lengthy documents (e.g., work outputs, minutes, manuals).
    *   **Features:** Standardized table of contents with a tree structure, table/picture insertion, layout structure maintenance.

*   **Presentation Tools (e.g., MS PowerPoint, Prezi):**
    *   **Purpose:** Supporting presentations, creating visually-aided reports.
    *   **Features:** Visual creation of table of contents and text on master layouts, diverse presentation effects.

*   **Spreadsheets (e.g., MS Excel, Google Spreadsheet):**
    *   **Purpose:** Expressing quantitative information, documents requiring formula-based calculations, tabular data, numerical reporting.
    *   **Features:** Document divided into cells for text/numbers, ability to write predefined functions or macros for repetitive tasks.

### **Section 2: Introduction to Technical Documents**

#### 2.1 Why Technical Communication Matters
In today's information society, document exchange via email and electronic approvals are common. The ability to write logical, convincing technical documents is crucial for professional success, especially with frequent project proposals, reports, and performance plans.

#### 2.2 Definition of Technical Documents
*   **Core Definition:** Documents that describe product handling, function/architecture development/use, providing information for end-users, administrators, and service technicians to understand a product's interior/exterior. They use specialized terminology from fields like engineering, technology, and science.
*   **Expanded Concept (Technical Communication):** "Any writing and communication for business performance, regardless of business, industry, or specialized field." It aims to explain facts, persuade, or instruct actions.

#### 2.3 Key Features of Technical Documents
Technical documents must possess specific qualities to be effective:

*   **Clarity:**
    *   Meaning of words/sentences should be unambiguous and not open to different interpretations.
    *   Avoid abstract or metaphorical language to prevent confusion and convey accurate content.

*   **Accuracy:**
    *   Content must conform to objective facts based on materials and data.
    *   The logical development process, using given materials/data and rational thinking, must be accurate and consistent.

*   **Structuredness:**
    *   Often follow specific formats (e.g., reports, manuals, proposals) with elements like introduction, body, and conclusion.
    *   These elements should be structured to achieve overall unity and coherence.

#### 2.4 Types of Technical Documents
Technical documents aim to provide information or solve specific problems. In Software Development (SW), they are closely related to the project and are classified accordingly (though specific types are not detailed in this section of the text).

F) Checklist  for business  documents
Good quality business  documents  cannot be produced  unless the final inspection procedure  for business  doc-
uments is conducted  from the  objective  perspective  of a third party. To do this, it is necessary  to compare
and review whether  your document  conforms  to the requirements  described  in the checklist  below after writ-
ing the document.
<Table 5> Checklist  for Business  Documents
No. Inspection  Criteria Confirmed
1 Is there a description  of why this report or proposal  is needed?
2 Is it easy to understand  from the perspective  of the person who will ultimately  read the report?
3 Is there an answer  to the question  “Why should | do this?” for the proposed  plan?
4 Are the possible  alternatives  and their pros and cons well described?
5 Are there any alternatives  missing?  Are the answers  prepared  verbally?
6 Are the sentences  concise  and clear? Aren't there any lengthy  ones?
7 Does the title of the report  well represent  its content?
8 Are there any logical errors in the table of contents?
9 “Are you prepared  for answering  the question  “what are you going to do specifically?”?
10 Is it easy enough  to understand  without  explanation?
1 Is it visually  appealing?  Is there the beauty  of white space?
12 Is there any concrete,  intuitive,  and logical gap?
13 Aren't there too many colors?  Is the color conspicuous?
14 Is the evidence  clear? Has the source of the supporting  data been examined  and described?
G) Use of business  documentation  tools
Commonly  used commercial  tools for writing business  documents  include word processors  (HWP, MS Word),
presentation  tools (MS PowerPoint,  Prezi), and spreadsheets  (MS Excel, Google Spreadsheet).  These tools
support  many functions  that can meet the requirements  of business  documents,  so knowing  how to use them
well comes in handy.
@ Word Processor
It is a tool that is commonly  used to create relatively  lengthy  documents  such as outputs  of specific  work,
minutes,  and manuals.  It has a standardized  structure of  table of contents,  and each table of contents  has a
tree structure  for each level. The main functions  are the insertion  of tables and pictures,  and maintenance  of
the layout structure.
@ Presentation  Tools

Presentation  tools are mainly used for materials  supporting  presentations  or for creating  reports with visual
aids. The table of contents  and texts are visually created on the standardized  master layout, and there are
functions  that support  the diverse  composition  of presentation  effects.
© Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets  are widely used for expressing  a variety  of quantitative  information,  such as documents  requiring
formula-based  calculation,  tabular  documents,  and reporting  of numerical  contents.  The entire document  is
divided into a number  of cells in a spreadsheet,  and you can enter text or numbers  in each cell, and you can
write a predefined  function  or a macro for repetitive  work.

>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
As we enter the information  society, document  exchange  using e-mail and decision  making
using electronic  approval  systems  are spreading.  As various project proposals,  reports, and work
performance  plans are prepared  frequently,  the ability to write logical and convincing  technical
documents  has become  a decisive  factor in determining  success  and failure in one's work.
>> Learning  Objectives
1. To be able to explain the concepts  and types of technical  documents.
2. To be able to clearly write technical  documents  that fit the purpose.
