## Learning Guide: Network System Architecture

### 04. Network Service Quality

#### A) Quality of Service (QoS) Characteristics

**QoS Definition:** Technology that guarantees a communication service's quality and performance to meet user requirements.

**QoS Attributes:**
*   **Confidence:** Ensures safe packet delivery to the destination.
*   **Delay:** Time taken to transmit a packet from sender to receiver.
*   **Jitter:** Variation in delay for packets belonging to the same flow.
*   **Bandwidth:** Maximum data transfer rate available in communication.

#### B) Quality Implementation Techniques

**1. Scheduling:**
Routers manage packet flow, and scheduling determines the order of packet delivery.

*   **FIFO Queuing (First-In, First-Out):** Delivers packets in order of arrival (basic Internet method).
*   **Priority Queuing:** Assigns priority to packets; higher-priority packets are handled first.
*   **Weighted Fair Queuing:** Assigns packets to priority classes/queues. Selects queues round-robin, delivering varying numbers of packets based on queue weight.

**2. Traffic Shaping and Traffic Policing:**
Used to control traffic speed and volume.

*   **Traffic Shaping:** Controls traffic *as it leaves* the network.
*   **Traffic Policing:** Controls traffic *as it enters* the network.

**Techniques:**
*   **Leaky Bucket:** Stores burst input packets in a buffer ("bucket") and outputs them at an average, steady rate. Packets may be discarded if the input exceeds bucket size.
*   **Token Bucket:** A fundamental algorithm used by both traffic shaping and policing.

**3. Resource Reservation:**
Method of reserving network resources (e.g., buffer, bandwidth, CPU, time) for a specific data flow to ensure service quality.

**4. Admission Control:**
A procedure where a communication network's control unit decides whether to accept a new connection request.

**5. Service Quality Model and Protocol:**

*   **Service Quality Models:**
    *   **Integrated Service (IntServ):** A flow-based model that explicitly reserves resources (like bandwidth) for a specific data flow.
    *   **Differentiated Service (DiffServ):** A class-based model that specifies the required service type for each packet transmission, operating based on packet priority.

*   **Service Quality Protocol:**
    *   **Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP):** A standardized protocol used to reserve and secure bandwidth for applications between endpoints (RFC 2110).

### 05. Routing Protocol Algorithm and Type

#### A) What is a Routing Protocol?
Defines the messages, exchange procedures, and actions routers use to efficiently set up and update routing tables.

#### B) What is a Routing Algorithm?
Finds the "low-cost" (minimum value of combined link costs) path between a source and destination router in a network.

**Types of Routing Algorithms:**

*   **Link State Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Each router has a complete map (configuration and link-state information) of the entire network.
    *   Calculates the low-cost path to all destinations independently.
*   **Distance Vector Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Each router maintains a table (vector) of low-cost paths to all destinations.
    *   Initially, only stores costs to directly connected neighbors.
    *   Shares its path cost data with neighboring routers.

**Specific Algorithms:**

*   **Dijkstra Algorithm:**
    *   A leading **link-state** routing algorithm.
    *   Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes by iteratively building a tree of shortest paths.

*   **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
    *   A leading **distance-vector** routing algorithm.
    *   Finds the shortest path from a single source node by iteratively "relaxing" (updating) all edges in the graph `|V|-1` times (where `|V|` is the number of nodes).

#### C) Routing Protocol Types (Classification)

Routing protocols are classified by routing type and Autonomous System (AS).

**Autonomous System (AS):** A collection of networks under a single, independent management system with a common operating policy.

*   **Static Routing:** Manual configuration of routes.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Routes are automatically learned and updated.
    *   **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol):** Protocols used *within* an Autonomous System (AS).
        *   Examples: RIP, OSPF, IGRP, ISIS, EIGRP.
    *   **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol):** Protocols used *between* different Autonomous Systems (ASs).
        *   Example: BGP.

#### D) Routing Protocol Type (Details)

| Protocol | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| **RIP**  | - Uses **distance-vector** algorithm. <br> - Broadcasts routing table every 30 seconds. <br> - Limited to 15 hops (16th hop is unreachable). <br> - Does NOT support Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM). <br> - Does NOT support load balancing. <br> - Does NOT reflect network state (bandwidth, delay, load). |
| **IGRP** | - Enhances some RIP problems. <br> - Reflects network state (bandwidth, delay, load). <br> - Increased hop limit (up to 255 hops). <br> - Does NOT support VLSM. <br> - Supports load balancing. |
| **OSPF** | - Uses **link-state** algorithm. <br> - Spreads information on changes (user-specified, economical, multiple routes) faster than RIP. <br> - All routers maintain the same network topology information. <br> - Supports VLSM and load balancing. |
| **BGP**  | - An **EGP** method for connecting different ASs and large network interconnections. <br> - Uses a **path-vector** routing algorithm. <br> - Operates over TCP. |

### 06. IPv4 Overview

#### A) What is an IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) Address?

*   A **32-bit address** used at the IP layer.
*   Serves as a unique and universal identifier for a router or host connected to the Internet.
*   **Structure:** Composed of four 8-bit sections (octets), typically represented in dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

04 Network  Service  Quality
A) Quality  of Service  (QoS) characteristics
QoS is the technology  of guaranteeing  a service quality and performance  of a communication  service  to meet user
requirements,  The attributes  to determine  the QoS include confidence,  delay, jitter, and bandwidth,  as shown in
<Table  45>.
{Table 45) QoS Measurements
Attribute Description
Confidence - An attribute  needed by a flow in order to deliver a packet safely to the destination
Delay - Adelay  when transmitting  a packet from the transmitting  side to the receiving  side
Jitter - Variation  of delay for packets belonging  to the same flow
Bandwidth - The maximum  rate available  in communication,  i.e. the ability to transmit  information
B) Quality  implementation  technique
® Scheduling
Routers  are responsible  for handling  packets  over the Internet.  Therefore,  the packet  flow can differ, according  to the
schedule.

- The method  assigns  a priority  class to packets,  and packets  are assigned  to each priority  queue.
Weighted  fair queuing - It selects  a queue in the form  of a round-robin,  and the packets  in the selected  queue are delivered.
The number  of packets  delivered  varies, according  to the weight  of the queue.
@ Traffic shaping  and traffic policing
As a way to control the traffic speed and volume,  traffic shaping  is used when the traffic leaves the network, and
traffic policing  is used when the traffic enters  the network.

05 Routing  Protocol  Algorithm  and Type
A) What is a routing  protocol?
Routing  protocol  defines  the types of messages  exchanged  between  routers,  exchange  procedure,  and actions  when
receiving  a message,  for efficient  setting  and updating  of the routing  tables.
B) What is a routing  algorithm?
The routing algorithm  finds the low-cost  path between  a source router and a destination  router in a graphical
network,  connected  by links with a cost between  routers. The low-cost  path refers to the path of minimum  value
among  the sum of link costs out of all possible  paths from the source to the destination.  <Table 49> shows the types
of routing  algorithms.
Table 49) Routing  Algorithm  Types
Algorithm Description
+ Link state routing  algorithm
+ Each router calculates  the low-cost  path to all destinations  with the configuration  and link-state  information
of the entire network.Link state
Routing
+ Distance  vector routing  algorithm
Distance  vector + Each router maintains  the low-cost  path table (vector)  to all destination  routers.
Routing + The initial router path cost table only maintains  the cost data of the directly  connected  routers, and the
router notifies  the path cost data to the neighboring  routers.
