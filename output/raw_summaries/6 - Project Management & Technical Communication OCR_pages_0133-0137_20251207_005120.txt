## Project Management & Risk Control Learning Guide

### I. Risk Response Strategies

#### A. Negative Risk Response: Acceptance

Adopted when risk elimination isn't possible and other response strategies can't be established.

1.  **Passive Acceptance:**
    *   No active steps taken.
    *   Risk is documented.
    *   Project team handles the risk if it occurs.
2.  **Active Acceptance:**
    *   Proactively build a **contingency reserve** (time, capital, resources) to deal with the risk if it occurs.

#### B. Positive Risk Response Strategies (Opportunities)

Methods for dealing with risks that can positively impact project objectives.

1.  **Exploit:**
    *   Eliminate uncertainty to ensure an opportunity happens.
    *   *Actions:* Reduce provision cost, dedicate skilled resources to shorten completion time.
2.  **Share:**
    *   Share ownership of an opportunity with other organizations to realize it.
    *   *Actions:* Establish partnerships, create special-purpose organizations.
3.  **Enhance:**
    *   Maximize the probability and impact of an opportunity.
    *   *Actions:* Identify main causes, take actions to maximize effectiveness.
4.  **Acceptance:**
    *   Choose to take advantage of an opportunity if it arises naturally.
    *   No active pursuit or dedicated resources to make the opportunity happen.

### II. Risk Control

**Definition:** The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking and managing identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk management activities.

**Methods:**

1.  **Risk Reassessment:**
    *   Regularly identify new risks.
    *   Reassess current risks.
    *   Terminate outdated risks.
2.  **Risk Audits:**
    *   Investigate and document the effectiveness of risk countermeasures and risk management processes.
3.  **Variance and Trend Analysis:**
    *   Analyze differences between planned and actual outcomes.
    *   Review trends in project execution using performance information.
4.  **Technical Performance Measurement:**
    *   Compare actual technical performance (e.g., weight, number of transactions, defects, storage capacity) against the project plan's schedule.

### III. Project Evaluation

#### A. Evolution of Success Criteria

*   **Past:** Project success measured by completing on schedule, within budget, and achieving original objectives.
*   **Current:** Success measured by quantitative and qualitative contribution to company management goals and competitiveness.

#### B. Evaluation Stages

1.  **Ex-ante evaluation:** Before the project starts.
2.  **Interim evaluation:** During the project.
3.  **Ex-post evaluation:** After the project is completed.

#### C. Evaluation Types

1.  IT Investment Performance Management
2.  Performance Evaluation

#### D. Importance of Long-Term Value (Sydney Opera House Example)

*   A project might initially fail traditional metrics (over budget, delayed).
*   However, it can still be a long-term success if it delivers significant value or achieves strategic goals.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Transparent and reliable decisions are needed for changes in project scope, cost, and schedule, considering potential long-term value.

### IV. Project Management Systems (PMS)

**Definition:** A system used to manage the entire process from project creation to completion, providing efficiency and transparency, removing risk factors, and managing schedules for large-scale projects.

*   **Purpose:** Manage projects, connect with practical software for efficiency.
*   **Functionality:** Team members input activity completion rates, software manages overall project progress (e.g., Excel, dedicated PMS).
*   **Examples (Open Source Tools):** Redmine, Gantt Project, Open Project.

### V. Risk Management Systems (RMS)

**Definition:** A tool or system used by project managers to monitor and control project-related issues and risks throughout the project lifecycle.

*   **Purpose:** Track and manage identified risks and issues, similar to how requirements are managed with a Traceability Matrix.
*   **Functionality:** Provides a centralized way to log, track, and update the status of issues and risks.

### VI. Configuration Management Systems (CMS)

**Definition:** A management tool that systematically manages source codes or deliverables in an environment where multiple people work simultaneously.

*   **Purpose:** Prevent duplicate revisions and loss of updated content.
*   **Key Functionality:** Tracks the history of source codes/deliverables and performs **version control**.
*   **Popular Tools:** CVS, Subversion, Git.

Strategy Explanation
This strategy  is adopted  when risk elimination  is not possible. Passive  acceptance  and active
acceptance  are selected  when appropriate  response  strategies  cannot be established.
+ Passive  acceptance:  No action is required  other than documenting  the strategy  and the risk
incurred  is handled  by the project  team.
+ Active acceptance:  actively  build a contingency  reserve,  including  time, capital,  or resources  to
deal with the risk.Acceptance
Positive risk response  strategy  is a method of dealing  with risks that can have  a positive  impact on the proj-
ect objectives  and includes  Exploit,  Share, Enhance  and Acceptance.
<Table 68> Positive  Risk Response  Strategy
Strategy Explanation
+ An activity  that eliminates  uncertainty  so that opportunities  are evident  during the
Exploit project's  execution  period, requiring  actions such as reducing  the cost of provision  or
dedicating  competent  resources  to shorten  the completion  time.
+ If there is a positive  impact on the progress  of the project,  ownership  of the opportunity  is
Share shared with other organizations  to realize opportunities,  including  establishing  partnerships
with risk-sharing  partners  and special-purpose  organizations.
+ As a strategy  to maximize  the probability  and impact  of an opportunity,  it identifies  the
Elie main causes and take action to maximize effectiveness
Acceptance + Choose  to take advantage  of opportunities  but not actively  pursue them so that risks arise
E) Risk Control
Risk control is a process  for implementing  a risk response plan, tracking and managing  identified  risks, mon-
itoring residual risks, identifying  new risks, and evaluating  risk management  activities.  Assessing  the effec-
tiveness  of a risk response  by monitoring  the identified  risks and investigating  and documenting  whether  risk
management  is effective.
<Table 69> Risk Control  Method
Method Explanation
+ Perform  on a regular  schedule  with activities  to identify  new risks as a result of riskRisk Reassessment :monitoring  and control,  reassess  current  risks, and terminate  outdated  risks.
+ Investigate  and document  the effectiveness  of risk countermeasures  addressing  theSSeS identified risks and root causes, and the effectiveness  of risk management  processes.
+ Analyze  the difference  between  planned  and actual outputs,  and review trends inVariance  and Trend Analysis - : ; ; ais project execution using performance  information  for event monitoring  and controlling
+ Technical  performance  during project  execution  is compared  to the technical
performance  schedule  in the project  plan, and technical  performance  is measured  by

>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
In the past, whether  the project was completed on schedule,  did not exceed the budget, and
achieved  the originally  planned  objective  were the criteria for measuring  its success and failure. In
contrast,  today, how much the project contributed  quantitatively  and qualitatively  to achieving  the
company's  management  goals and improvement  of competitiveness  is an evaluating  criterion.
>> Learning  Objectives
To be able to explain the concept  of project  evaluation  and step-by-step  process
>> Concept  summary
+ Evaluation  stage: Ex-ante  evaluation,  interim evaluation,  ex-post  evaluation
+ Evaluation  type: IT investment  performance  management,  performance  evaluation

+ Preview  for practical business
If the project evaluation  criteria are successfully  met within the planned schedule and budget, the
project is evaluated  as a success,  However,  the Sydney Opera House runs counter  to such idea.
The construction  project,  which started with the groundbreaking  ceremony  in 1958, was delayed
leading to additional  costs increasing  exponentially.  The duration  got 6 years longer than originally
planned,  and the cost was 15 times higher than the original budget.  A project  with the construction
duration  and cost increased  significantly  compared  to the original plan is a failure in terms of project
management.  But what about now? More than 100  million tourists  visit the venue each year, earning
several times more profit the total construction  cost, and it has even been designated  as the World
Heritage  Site as a modern  building.
In business,  project performance  and evaluation  are based on compliance  with scope, schedule,
and cost, but even if the project fails to accomplish  the original plan, it may not be necessarily  a
failure, given the potential  value of the completed  project. In other words, it is necessary  to m...
