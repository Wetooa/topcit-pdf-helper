## Software Requirements Management: A Study Guide

### 1. Introduction: Why Requirements Management Matters

*   **Problem:** Project failures often stem from poor requirements management.
*   **Statistics:**
    *   50% of IT project failures linked to requirements management.
    *   70-80% of total project cost caused by requirements management failures.
*   **Main Causes of Failure:**
    *   **Inadequate Definition/Insufficient Communication:** Poor understanding of requirements early on, limited stakeholder dialogue.
    *   **Lack of Change Management:** Not considering the impact of requirement changes on deliverables.

### 2. Requirements Management (RM)

#### 2.1 Definition
*   **Requirements Engineering** consists of:
    *   **Requirements Development:** Defining "what to do."
    *   **Requirements Management:** Checking if defined requirements are accurately reflected and continuously managing changes.

#### 2.2 Importance
*   Provides effective communication among stakeholders.
*   Prevents project delays and budget overruns.
*   Ensures systematic management of user requirements from the project's start.

#### 2.3 Purposes
*   Satisfy customer requirements by understanding their perspective.
*   Produce high-quality software within schedule and budget constraints.

#### 2.4 Requirements Management Process
This process covers activities throughout the software development lifecycle.

| Process Step              | Description                                                                                             | Deliverable(s)             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| **1. Requirements Extraction** | Define business requirements, identify participants, extract initial requirements.                        | Candidate requirements     |
| **2. Requirements Analysis** | Model candidate requirements, prioritize them, discuss with stakeholders.                                 | Agreed requirements        |
| **3. Requirements Specification** | Define specification standards, create the requirements specification document, record traceability info. | Formal requirement         |
| **4. Requirements Verification** | Review the specification, verify terms, set the requirements baseline.                                  | Baselined Requirement      |
| **5. Requirements Change Management** | Control requirements changes, manage traceability, control versions (history).                          | Consistent Requirement     |

#### 2.5 Principles of Requirements Management
*   Prioritize customer value based on requirements and obtain stakeholder consent.
*   Clearly identify the exact target of the system (manage expectations and scope).
*   Analyze the impact of requirement changes using a **Change Control Board (CCB)** and set a baseline for each change.

### 3. Requirements Specification

#### 3.1 Requirements Specification Techniques
These techniques define requirements, categorized by method:

| Classification | Technique Name                  | Description                                                                     |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Formal**     | **VDM** (Vienna Development Method) | Mathematics-based; provides a framework for development and systematic verification. |
|                | **ESM** (Finite State Machine)  | Expresses state transitions based on input signals.                             |
| **Informal**   | **SADT** (Structured Analysis and Design Technique) | Graphic-based structural analysis model.                                        |
|                | **Use Case**                    | User-based modeling.                                                            |
|                | **Decision Table**              | Documents probabilities and cases for decision-making.                          |
|                | **ER Modeling** (Entity Relationship) | Represents entities and their relationships.                                    |

#### 3.2 Principles of Requirements Specification (IEEE Standards)
The IEEE recommends these principles for high-quality software requirements specifications:

*   **Verifiability:** Requirements can be objectively tested.
*   **Modifiability:** Requirements can be easily changed without excessive effort.
*   **Clarity:** Requirements are clearly presented to all stakeholders.
*   **Accuracy:** Requirements are precisely and correctly described.
*   **Traceability:** The source and reasoning behind each requirement can be tracked.
*   **Consistency:** No conflicts exist between different requirements.
*   **Completeness:** All important details (functionality, performance, constraints) are documented.
*   **Interpretability:** Requirements provide a consistent interpretation for everyone.
*   **Understandability:** Requirements are easy for stakeholders to comprehend.

#### 3.3 Main Contents of a Requirements Specification (IEEE Standard)
This outlines the typical structure and details of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS):

1.  **Overview**
    *   Purpose of the SRS and software, intended audience.
    *   Development scope (constraints, characteristics, business strategy).
2.  **Overall Description**
    *   Project perspective, product functions (list only).
    *   User characteristics (experience, education, frequency of use).
    *   Software operating environment (hardware, OS, software).
    *   Constraints (hardware, memory, security, multilingual support).
    *   Assumptions (dependencies on outsourced components, other projects).
    *   User scenarios (how users interact with the system).
3.  **Interface**
    *   User Interface (UI) details.
    *   Hardware Interface (protocols, interaction between components).
    *   Software Interface (data/messages exchanged with other software).
4.  **Functional Requirements**
    *   Detailed requirements for each function listed in Chapter 2.
    *   For each function: purpose, inputs (with validation), outputs (with error messages, parameters).
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements**
    *   **Performance Requirements:** Speed, response time, throughput.
    *   **Security Requirements:** Authentication, authorization, data protection.
    *   **Software Quality Requirements:** Availability, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, usability.
6.  **Other Requirements**
    *   Operation rules, standards (e.g., Current Business Process - CBP, Future Process Model - FPM).

### 4. Requirements Change and Tracking Management

#### 4.1 Overview of Requirements Traceability
*   **Inevitability of Change:** Once a requirements baseline is set, changes are unavoidable.
*   **Purpose:** Formally control all changes to maintain consistency and integrity.
*   **Reasons for Changes/Errors:**
    *   Initial requirements errors, conflicts, or inconsistencies.
    *   Participants gaining a deeper understanding of the system.
    *   Changes in the system's environment or organization.
    *   Technical, time, or cost issues arising.
*   **Reducing Errors:** Defining and configuring traceability helps reduce these errors.
*   **What is Traced?** Traceability applies to individual sentences/elements within the requirements document, not just the document as a whole. This ensures fine-grained tracking of each requirement's origin, implementation, and verification.

* Preview  for practical  business
Projects  fail mostly because  of inappropriate  requirements  management.
According  to data from Standish  Group, a global market  research  organization,  50% of IT project
failures in overseas  countries  are related to requirements  management,  and 70-80%  of the total
project cost is caused by the failure of requirements  management.  The above data also apply to
domestic  projects.  The main causes  of these results can be summarized  as follows.
- Inadequate  definition  of requirements/insufficient  communication:  Insufficient  understanding  of
the requirements  in the early development  process due to limited resources  and timelines,  and
incomplete  dialogue  between  stakeholders.
- Lack of change management:  When changing  the customers’  requirements  or the development
deliverables,  its impact  and relevancy  are not considered.

01 Requirements  Management
A) Definition  of requirements  management
Requirements  engineering  can be largely divided into requirements  development  and requirements
management.  Requirements  development  consists  in defining  what to do, while requirements  management
consists  in checking  whether  the planned and defined requirements  are accurately  reflected  and in managing
changes  to the first requirements  on a continuous  basis.
B) Importance  of requirements  management
Proper requirements  management  should provide an effective  means  of communication  among the
stakeholders,  prevent  delivery  delays and going over budget through systematic  requirements management
from the initial phase of the project,  and execute  and manage  the user requirements  specification.
C) Purposes  of requirements  management
Requirements  management  aims to satisfy the customer’s  requirements  by understanding  them from the
customer's  point of view and to produce  high-quality  software  within  a limited schedule  and period.
D) Requirements  management  process
The figure below illustrates  the requirements  management  activities  in the entire software  development  life
cycle.

setting  a baseline  for each change  step.
02 Requirements  Specification
Requirements  should be defined by specification  techniques,  and the correct specification  can be defined only
when the principles  are considered.
A) Requirements  specification  techniques
Requirements  specification  techniques  can be divided into formal specification  and informal specification
depending  on the method.
