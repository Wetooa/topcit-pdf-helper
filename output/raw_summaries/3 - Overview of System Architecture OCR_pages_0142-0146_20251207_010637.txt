## Big Data System Architecture & Ecosystem

### 1. MapReduce Word Count Process

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across a cluster. Here's how it works for counting words:

1.  **Input:** Raw data (e.g., a character string).
2.  **Splitting:** Divides the input data into smaller chunks (e.g., by line).
3.  **Mapping:**
    *   Processes each chunk independently.
    *   Takes each line, extracts words, and outputs them as `<Key, Value>` pairs (e.g., `<DOG, 1>`, `<CAT, 1>`).
4.  **Shuffling:**
    *   Gathers all values for the same key from across different mappers.
    *   Groups them together (e.g., `DOG -> [1, 1, 1]`).
5.  **Reducing:**
    *   Processes the grouped data for each key.
    *   Calculates the sum of frequencies for each key (e.g., `DOG -> 3`).
    *   Outputs the final `<Key, Value>` pairs (e.g., `<DOG, 3>`).
6.  **Final Result:** Combines the output from all reducers and stores it (e.g., in Hadoop Distributed File System - HDFS).

### 2. Hadoop Support Programs (Ecosystem Technologies)

Hadoop's ecosystem includes various support programs for collecting, storing, utilizing, processing, and managing big data:

#### A. Data Collection
*   **Unstructured Data:**
    *   **Flume:** Collects unstructured data (developed by Cloudera, now Apache).
    *   **Scribe:** Collects unstructured data for transfer to a centralized server (developed by Facebook).
    *   **Chukwa:** Collects unstructured data to store in HDFS.
*   **Structured Data:**
    *   **Sqoop:** Imports data from relational databases and transfers it to repositories like HDFS and NoSQL.
    *   **Hiho:** Solution for large-capacity structured data collection and transfer.

#### B. Distributed Database
*   **HBase:** HDFS-based, column-oriented NoSQL database (based on Google's BigTable paper). Used by Yahoo, Twitter, NHN.
*   **Cassandra:** Open-source distributed database management system. A NoSQL database that blends column-centered and row-centered approaches.

#### C. Real-time SQL Query
*   **Impala:** Real-time SQL query system (developed by Cloudera). Uses its own engine, not MapReduce.

#### D. Data Management & Analysis
*   **HCatalog:** Manages big data metadata.
*   **Hive:** Hadoop-based data warehousing solution. Provides SQL-like query capabilities for big data processing (developed by Facebook).
*   **Pig:** Data analysis tool that uses its own language, Pig Latin, instead of MapReduce for processing.
*   **Spark:** Open-source cluster computing framework for in-memory processing (developed by UC Berkeley's AMPLab).
*   **Mahout:** Hadoop-based open-source data mining library.

#### E. System Management & Coordination
*   **Oozie:** Manages big data processing workflows and Hadoop tasks.
*   **Zookeeper:** Provides mutual coordination services for servers in a distributed big data environment.
*   **Avro:** Framework supporting serialization for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and data.
*   **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):** Hadoop's resource management platform. Manages computing resources within clusters and schedules user applications in a distributed computing environment.

### 3. Commercial Hadoop Solutions

Leading companies offer commercial Hadoop solutions, often building platforms based on Hadoop and forming alliances with existing database, data warehousing, and business intelligence companies.

*   **Cloudera:**
    *   **CDH (Cloudera Distribution including Hadoop):** Includes Hadoop, Hive, Oozie, Pig, Zookeeper, and other open-source tools.
    *   **Cloudera Manager:** A tool for managing and monitoring the CDH environment.
        *   **Free Edition:** Supports up to 50-node clusters with limited functions for infrastructure service and setting management.
        *   **Enterprise Edition:** Supports unlimited node clusters, active monitoring, and additional data analysis tools.
        *   *Note: Cloudera and Hortonworks merged on October 3, 2018.*

*   **Hortonworks (HDP - Hortonworks Data Platform):**
    *   Includes Hadoop, Hive, Oozie, Pig, Zookeeper, and other open-source tools.
    *   All software is free; revenue comes from education and support programs.

*   **MapR:**
    *   **M3:** Free version, offers NFS access, integrated management UI, and improved scalability.
    *   **M5:** Paid subscription version, features include no single points of failure, mirroring, snapshots, NFS High Availability (HA), and data placement control.
    *   **M7:** Enhancements for HBase, offering improved speed, scalability, and stability.

## Big Data System Trends & Forecast

### 1. Big Data System Trends

*   **Ecosystem Formation:** Service providers build corporate ecosystems by addressing big data challenges like real-time and memory-based processing, ease of query, and varied file system accessibility.
    *   **Cloud Providers (Amazon):** Link their cloud capabilities with open-source big data solutions to create unique platforms.
    *   **Enterprise Leaders (IBM, Microsoft):** Adapt strategies to focus on big data, leveraging existing competencies.
    *   **Mobile-based Companies (Google, Apple):** Build analysis systems based on existing servers and user data to enhance services.
*   **Service Delivery Differentiation:**
    *   **Total Solution Providers (Amazon, IBM, Google):** Develop internal platforms supporting the entire big data analysis process and offer consulting services.
    *   **Specialized Solution Companies (Teradata, Good Data):** Focus on specific functions like analysis and visualization for big data, striving for unique performance.

### 2. Forecast of Big Data Systems

*   **Low Versatility:** Despite the growth of the Hadoop ecosystem, it remains technically complex for non-engineers, often requiring significant help from engineers.
*   **Growth of Open-Source Systems:** The rise of open-source technologies creates a competitive landscape, enabling small venture companies offering user-centered customized software and traditional cloud companies to thrive.
*   **Strengthened Linkage with AI:**
    *   Industrial use of AI (e.g., IBM Watson, Google AlphaGo) is increasing.
    *   Cloud companies are integrating their infrastructure with AI and forming expanded ecosystems through cooperation with competitors.
