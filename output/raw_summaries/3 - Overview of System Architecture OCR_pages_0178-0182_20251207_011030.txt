| Address Type    | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Link-Local**  | - Can only be used within the internal network segment. <br/> - Example: `FE80:0000:0000:0000:2CDA:D834:CBA0:XXXX` (first 64 bits are typically `FE80::`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Global Unicast** | - Can be used externally (routable on the internet). <br/> - Consists of Network Address, Interface ID, and Prefix. <br/> - Example: `2001:DB8:131F:0000:0000:070D:126A:140B /64`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Multicast**   | - Delivers packets to **all** interfaces registered in a specific multicast group. <br/> - Format: Starts with `FF` (8 bits), followed by a 4-bit flag, a 4-bit scope, and a 112-bit group ID. <br/> - **Flag (last bit):** `0` = well-known multicast address; `1` = temporarily used multicast address.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Anycast**     | - Similar to multicast (designates multiple interfaces), but packets are delivered only to the **nearest** interface (router's perspective) in the group, not all. <br/> - Expressed as `n-bit Prefix` and `0` for the remaining `(128-n)` bits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### **2. IPv6 Header Structure**

IPv6 uses a basic header and can include optional extension headers.

#### **A) IPv6 Basic Header (40 octets / 320 bits)**

| Component         | Size    | Description                                       |
| :---------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Version**       | 4 bits  | IP Version (always 6 for IPv6).                   |
| **Traffic Class** | 8 bits  | Requests transmission priority (for QoS).         |
| **Flow Label**    | 20 bits | Service classification for QoS.                   |
| **Payload Length**| 16 bits | Length of the data payload.                       |
| **Next Header**   | 8 bits  | Defines the type of header immediately following the IP header (e.g., TCP, UDP, or an Extension Header). |
| **Hop Limit**     | 8 bits  | Maximum number of hops (routers) a packet can traverse. Decremented by each router. |
| **Source Address**| 128 bits| Address of the sender device.                     |
| **Destination Address**| 128 bits| Address of the receiver device.                   |

#### **B) IPv6 Extension Headers**

*   **Optional:** Added after the basic header.
*   **Size:** Each extension header is set to 64 bits.
*   **Structure:** Configured in a "daisy chain" fashion, meaning one extension header points to the next, until the final payload.

| Header Type          | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hop-by-Hop Options** | Information needed by *all* communication devices (routers) in the path to process packets.                                                    |
| **Destination Options**| Information needed only by the *final destination* device to process packets.                                                                  |
| **Routing**          | Specifies a list of intermediate routes/paths the sender wants the packet to take.                                                             |
| **Fragmentation**    | Information for partitioning and recombining packets, especially when transmission length increases.                                           |
| **Authentication**   | Ensures data integrity and authenticates the sender.                                                                                           |
| **Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)**| Provides encryption for the packet's payload section.                                                                          |

## **Transport Layer Protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP)**

### **1. Overview of Transport Layer**

*   **Function:** Transmits application data between **end-point hosts** (e.g., your computer and a web server).
*   **Scope:** Operates **end-to-end**. Intermediate network devices (routers, switches) are *not* involved in transport layer protocol operations.
*   **Protocols:**
    *   **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
    *   **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)
    *   **SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) - A newer protocol combining advantages of TCP and UDP.

---

### **2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

*   **Connectionless Service:**
    *   No prior connection setup process required.
    *   Data can be sent and received immediately.
*   **Unreliable Protocol:**
    *   Does *not* guarantee data delivery.
    *   Does not use acknowledgments to confirm receipt.

---

### **3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

*   **Connection-Oriented Service:**
    *   Requires a pre-configuration process (connection establishment) before sending/receiving data.
    *   Requires connection termination after data transfer is complete.
*   **Reliable Protocol:**
    *   Provides reliable interprocess communication.
    *   Uses **acknowledgment techniques** (sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers) to confirm that transmitted data has been properly received.
*   **Position:** Sits between the application layer and the network layer in the TCP/IP model.
*   **Stream-Based:** Processes data as a continuous stream.
    *   Uses **transmission and reception buffers** to manage data flow.
    *   Breaks down the data stream into **segments** for the lower (network) layer to transmit as packets.
*   **Byte Numbering:** Assigns a sequence number to each byte of data within a segment.
    *   If `m` bits are used for the sequence number, it ranges from `0` to `2^m - 1` (modular `2^m`).
*   **Key Control Techniques for Reliability:**

    *   **Flow Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Prevents packet loss by controlling the volume of data sent, ensuring it doesn't exceed the receiver's capacity.
        *   **Mechanism:** Uses transmission and reception buffers on both sending and receiving sides.

    *   **Error Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Detects and corrects errors that occur during transmission to ensure accurate information.
        *   **Mechanisms:**
            *   Detects and discards damaged packets.
            *   Tracks and resends lost or missing packets.
            *   Checks for and discards duplicate received packets.

    *   **Congestion Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Manages network load to prevent congestion (when packets transmitted per unit time exceed network processing capacity).
        *   **Mechanism:** Ensures the total load is kept below the network's available bandwidth.
