# IP Addressing & Network Configuration Learning Guide

## 1. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

### 1.1 Concept
*   **Definition:** A method to combine multiple Class C IP addresses into a single larger network.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduces the size of routing tables.
    *   Allows flexible use of IP addresses with various subnet formats.

### 1.2 Role & Flexibility
*   Provides flexibility in IP address management by allowing users to define the network identifier range freely, without being restricted by traditional A, B, or C classes.
*   Prevents IP address waste and enables efficient network configuration.
*   Key for managing IP addresses used for routing between different domains.

### 1.3 CIDR Expression
*   **Format:** `a.b.c.d/x`
*   `x`: Represents the length (in bits) of the network part of the IP address (the subnet mask).
    *   **Example:** `200.23.16.0 / 23` means the first 23 bits define the network, and the remaining bits define the host.

## 2. Supernetting

### 2.1 Concept
*   **Definition:** The opposite of subnetting. It consolidates several smaller networks into one larger network.
*   **Purpose:** Allocates consecutive class address blocks to an organization, enabling external routing as if they were a single, larger address block.

### 2.2 Method
*   Groups multiple Class C addresses into a single network.
*   Achieved by using part of the *network identifier* as the *host identifier*, effectively shortening the network portion and expanding the host portion.
*   **Rules for Consolidation:**
    *   The number of consolidated Class C addresses must be a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8 networks).
    *   The addresses must be sequential.
*   **Effect:** A Supernet Mask (e.g., 255.255.248.0) allows more bits for hosts (e.g., 11 bits, supporting up to 8190 hosts), compared to a single Class C network (8 bits, up to 254 hosts).

## 3. IPv4 Address Allocation

### 3.1 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
*   **Definition:** A protocol for automatically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration details to devices (clients) on a network via a DHCP server.
*   **DHCP Server Provides:**
    *   IP Address
    *   Subnet Mask
    *   Default Gateway
    *   DNS Server Address
    *   Lease Period (how long the IP is assigned)
    *   Domain Name
    *   Local Router address

*   **IPv4 DHCP Lease Process (4-step UDP Message Exchange):**
    1.  **DHCPDISCOVER:** Client broadcasts a request (to `255.255.255.255`) to find a DHCP server and get an IP.
    2.  **DHCPOFFER:** DHCP server responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and lease period.
    3.  **DHCPREQUEST:** Client accepts the offer (or requests to keep a previous IP) and sends a request back to the server.
    4.  **DHCPACK:** DHCP server sends an acknowledgment, confirming the IP address lease for the client.

### 3.2 NAT (Network Address Translation)
*   **Definition:** A function that allows devices on a private network to communicate with devices on a public network (like the Internet).
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Security:** Hides internal (private) IP addresses from external networks, protecting them from direct attacks.
    *   **IP Address Conservation:** Helps mitigate the shortage of public IPv4 addresses by allowing multiple private IPs to share fewer public IPs.

*   **NAT Types:**
    *   **Basic NAT:** Maps each private IP address to a unique public IP address. Requires as many public IPs as internal devices need to connect.
    *   **NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) / PAT (Port Address Translation):**
        *   An extension of basic NAT that allows multiple private IP addresses to share a *single* public IP address.
        *   Achieved by converting (translating) the packet's *source port number* in addition to the IP address.
        *   **Capacity:** Theoretically supports up to 65,535 internal hosts connecting simultaneously using one public IP address.

## 4. IPv6 Overview

### 4.1 What is IPv6?
*   **Definition:** The next-generation Internet Protocol (Internet Protocol Version 6).
*   **Addressing System:** Uses a 128-bit addressing system.
*   **Developed to Solve IPv4 Problems:**
    *   Address depletion (running out of IP addresses).
    *   Security concerns.
    *   Limited mobility support.

### 4.2 Background & Improvements over IPv4
*   Developed in the mid-1990s due to the rapid increase in network-connected devices, leading to IPv4 address shortages and security issues.
*   **Key Features & Advantages:**
    *   **Vastly Expanded Address Space:** 128 bits vs. 32 bits, allowing ~3.4 x 10^38 addresses (solves address depletion).
    *   **Simplified Header Format:** Removes infrequently used fields from the header for more efficient processing.
    *   **Enhanced QoS Support:** Better support for Quality of Service services.
    *   **Built-in Security:** Includes integrated security and privacy features (end-to-end encryption) via IPsec, unlike IPv4 which requires IPsec to be added separately.

## 5. IPv6 Addressing System and Header Structure

### 5.1 IPv6 Addressing System
*   **Length:** 128 bits (four times longer than IPv4).
*   **Expression:** Uses hexadecimal notation for readability.
*   **Format:** Each 16-bit segment is separated by a colon (e.g., `2001:0DB8:85A3:0000:0000:8A2E:0370:7334`).
*   **Network Prefix Notation:** Similar to IPv4's CIDR, uses `/x` to denote the length of the network prefix (e.g., `2001:DB8::/64`).

*   **Common IPv6 Address Format Prefixes:**
    *   `001`: Global Unicast Address (routable on the internet).
    *   `11111110 10` (`FE80::`): Link-Local Address.
    *   `11111111` (`FF00::`): Multicast Address.

*   **IPv6 Address Types (by Use):**
    *   **Link-Local Address:**
        *   **Usage:** Only valid and usable within the local network segment (not routable beyond it).
        *   **Purpose:** Used for communication and identification of devices within that specific network link.
        *   **Format Example:** `FE80::2CDA:D834:CBA0:1234`
    *   **Global Unicast Address:**
        *   **Usage:** Routable on the global Internet.
        *   **Purpose:** Unique identification of an interface on the public internet.
        *   **Format Example:** `2001:DB8:131F::70D:126A:140B/64` (consists of Network Address, Interface ID, and Prefix).
    *   **Multicast Address:**
        *   **Purpose:** Delivers packets to *all* interfaces that are members of a specific multicast group.
        *   **Format:** Starts with `FFxx::` (where `xx` denotes flags and scope, followed by a Group ID).
    *   **Anycast Address:**
        *   **Purpose:** Similar to multicast in designating multiple interfaces, but packets are delivered *only to the nearest* interface (based on routing metrics), not all of them.
        *   **Expression:** Defined by an `n-bit Prefix` followed by `0s` for the remaining bits.

### 5.2 IPv6 Header Structure

*   **Basic Header:** A fixed size of 40 bytes (320 bits).
*   **Extension Headers:** IPv6 can include multiple optional "extension headers" after the basic header, chained together in a specific sequence.

*   **IPv6 Basic Header Components:**
    *   **Version (4 bits):** Indicates IP version 6.
    *   **Traffic Class (8 bits):** Used for requesting transmission priority (QoS).
    *   **Flow Label (20 bits):** Used for service classification, especially for real-time applications (QoS).
    *   **Payload Length (16 bits):** Indicates the length of the data portion (payload) that follows the header.
    *   **Next Header (8 bits):** Identifies the type of the next header (e.g., TCP, UDP, or the first extension header).
    *   **Hop Limit (8 bits):** Maximum number of hops (routers) a packet can traverse. Decremented by each router; discarded if it reaches zero.
    *   **Source Address (128 bits):** The IP address of the sender.
    *   **Destination Address (128 bits):** The IP address of the recipient.

*   **IPv6 Extension Header Structure and Components:**
    *   **Chain:** Extension headers are linked in a daisy chain; each header's "Next Header" field points to the next header or the final payload.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Hop-by-Hop Options:** Information that must be processed by *every* device in the packet's path.
        *   **Destination Options:** Information intended *only* for the final destination device.
        *   **Routing:** Specifies a strict or loose path (list of intermediate routers) the packet must follow.
        *   **Fragment:** Handles packet fragmentation and reassembly for very large packets.
        *   **Authentication Header (AH):** Provides data integrity and sender authentication.
        *   **Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP):** Provides confidentiality (encryption) of the packet's payload section.

@ DHCP (Dynamic  Host Configuration  Protocol)
DHCP is a protocol  that provides  a method of dynamically  allocating  IP addresses,  and other related configuration
details,  to DHCP-enabled  clients on a network,  using a DHCP server.
The DHCP server can assign a default gateway,  a DNS server address, a local router, a lease period, and a domain
name as DHCP options, in addition  to the IP address  and subnet  mask.
The IPv4 DHCP lease process  is established  through  the exchange  of four UDP messages.  The four UDP messages
are DHCPDISCOVER,  DHCPOFFER,  DHCPREQUEST,  and DHCPACK.  <Table 54> lists the details.
{Table 54) DHCP Message  [10]
Message Description
DHCPDISCOVER The IP address,  sent by a client, has the address  value of 255.255.255.255.
DHCPOFFER The DHCP server  delivers information,  such as the IP address,  subnet mask, default  gateway,  and lease period.
The client sends DHCPREQUEST  to the server, and the message  includes  that the client has selected
the lease information.
DHCPACK The DHCP server  sends the DHCPACK  message  to the client to allow the use of the IP address.DHCPREQUEST
@NAT  (Network  Address  Translation)
NAT is a function  that interconnects  terminals  on a private network  to communicate  with public networks, such as
the Internet.  It is defined  in RFC 3022 and RFC 2663.
The purpose  of using NAT is to hide internal IPs to defend them from outside attacks  while solving insufficient  IP
addresses. NAPT (Network  Address  Port Translation)  is an extension  of the basic NAT and converts  the packet's
source  port number.  The reason for using NAPT is to connect  to multiple internal hosts with an IP address.  NAPT can
theoretically  process  communication  with up to 65,535 internal  hosts with an official IP address.

08 IPv6 Overview
A) What is an IPv6 (Internet  Protocol  Version  6) address?
IPv6 is the next-generation  Internet  protocol  with a 128-bit addressing  system developed  to solve the current IPv4
problems,  such as address  depletion,  security,  and mobility  support.
B) Background  of IPv6
The rapidly increasing  hosts and terminals  connected  to networks  have led to problems  with the existing IPv4
addressing  system, such as a shortage  of IP address  space and poor Internet  security.  The IPv6 protocol  [16] was
developed  in the mid-90s  to solve the problems. Compared  to the existing  IPv4, the most notable feature of IPv6
is the expansion  of the address  space, from 32 bits, to 128 bits, to enable the use of approximately  3.4 x 1032
addresses,  thereby  fundamentally  solving the ...
