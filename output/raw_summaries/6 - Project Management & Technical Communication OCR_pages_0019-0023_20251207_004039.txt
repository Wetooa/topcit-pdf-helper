## Learning Guide: Communication & Problem Solving Essentials

### I. Essence of Communication

*   **Written Communication:** Requires a structured format (e.g., subject line, summary, main text, explanation) due to varying environments and communication difficulties.
*   **Non-Verbal Communication:** Extremely important for message delivery. It significantly affects how information is received, often more than logical content alone.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **Tone, Intonation, Voice:** Accounts for a large portion of communication impact (e.g., 71% as per the diagram).
        *   **Gestures:** Body language, breathing changes, skin color, tears, sweat, eye contact, movement (stepping back/forward).
    *   **Impact:** An attractive voice or a bright smile can significantly enhance communication and attention.

### II. Methods of Business Communication

#### A) Types of Business Communication

Business communication is divided into two main categories:

1.  **Horizontal Communication:**
    *   **Definition:** Communication between individuals or departments at similar organizational levels (e.g., colleagues).
    *   **Purpose:** Achieve common goals through organic interaction, especially for complex or new challenges.
    *   **Examples:** Prior consultations, information circulation, committees, task forces.
    *   **Importance:** Increasingly vital for addressing complex, converged problems.

2.  **Vertical Communication:**
    *   **Definition:** Communication between different organizational levels (e.g., supervisors and subordinates).
    *   **Sub-types:**
        *   **Top-down Communication:** Instructions, commands, and directives from higher to lower levels.
        *   **Bottom-up Communication:** Reports and feedback from lower to higher levels.
    *   **Formal Communication:** Often requires standardized document formats and delivery techniques, especially when communicating with superiors.

#### B) Communication Channels & Information Integrity

*   **Communication Channels:** Common methods include meetings, emails, phone calls, reports, and official letters.
*   **Information Integrity:** Refers to the amount and diversity of information a communication channel can deliver.
    *   **High Integrity:** Can transmit large, complex information in multiple forms, with fast delivery and feedback.
    *   **Low Integrity:** Restricted to simpler information, limited forms, slower delivery, and feedback.

*   **Channel Integrity Spectrum (Highest to Lowest):**
    1.  **Direct Conversation:** Highest integrity (large info, various cues, fast delivery/feedback).
    2.  **Online Video Conference**
    3.  **Phone Conversation**
    4.  **Voice Mail**
    5.  **E-mail:** Moderate integrity (overcomes time/space, fast, attachments, creates a record).
    6.  **Informal Memo or Letter**
    7.  **Written Official Document:** Lowest integrity.

*   **Comparison of Key Channels:**

    | Feature        | Discussion                               | Meeting                                  | Email                                      |
    | :------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
    | **Definition** | Proponents/opponents present logical ideas/rebuttals. | People gather to discuss a topic and draw conclusions. | Communication in an internet environment.  |
    | **Purpose**    | Good decisions/judgments, logical thinking. | Info delivery/sharing, decision agreement, multiple topics, progress checks. | Info delivery/sharing, decision agreement, various requests. |
    | **Strengths**  | Logical judgment, analysis, develops listening skills. | Real-time opinion exchange, fast conclusions, easy info sharing. | Flexible (time/space), wide topic range, secure/traceable. |
    | **Weaknesses** | Can lose focus, become unilateral/critical if unprepared. | Can lack conclusion, waste time.         | Hard to convey nuanced/complex info, security/spam risks. |
    | **Business Use** | R&D, engineering for critical decisions. | Common for sharing info quickly, progress updates. | Common for info sharing, progress, source materials; requires concise, clear messages. |

#### C) Methods of Logical Explanation & Persuasion

*   **Logical Explanation:** Connects objective facts (grounds) with subjective arguments to capture attention and persuade stakeholders.

1.  **Deductive Reasoning:**
    *   **Definition:** Deriving a specific conclusion from general, known premises.
    *   **Types:**
        *   *Direct Reasoning:* One premise leads to one fact.
        *   *Indirect Reasoning:* Two or more premises lead to a concrete fact.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Premise 1: All men are mortal.
        *   Premise 2: Socrates is a man.
        *   Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

2.  **Inductive Reasoning:**
    *   **Definition:** Deriving a general principle or hypothesis from several concrete, empirical facts. (Introduced by Francis Bacon in 1620).
    *   **Example:**
        *   Concrete Fact 1: Socrates is dead.
        *   Concrete Fact 2: Socrates is a man.
        *   General Principle: Therefore, a man is mortal.

*   **Persuasion Beyond Pure Logic:** Logical explanation alone is often insufficient for effective persuasion.

*   **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:**
    *   **Purpose:** To statistically explain or verify an established hypothesis.
    *   **Key Concepts:**
        *   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The initial argument, based on existing knowledge or status quo (e.g., "The average life expectancy of men in Korea is 70 years").
        *   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A new argument that you aim to prove true through testing (e.g., "The average life expectancy of men in Korea is not 70 years").
    *   **Process:** Statistical tests are performed to determine whether to reject the Null Hypothesis and adopt the Alternative Hypothesis.

### III. Learning Objectives

1.  Identify the definition and types of business problems.
2.  Describe the business problem-solving process.
3.  Apply appropriate problem-solving techniques to various situations.

### IV. Practical Business Preview

*   **Scenario:** K System plans to enter the online bank business within the FinTech industry (focusing on payment/settlement services).
*   **Challenge:** Must submit a business plan to the Financial Services Commission and gain approval through review/presentation.
*   **Action Plan (Director Kim):**
    *   Conduct current situation analysis of K System and the external online bank environment.
    *   Prepare a comprehensive business plan including strategies for building the online bank.
    *   Utilize various business problem-solving techniques to understand K System and competitors, and to define the online bank promotion strategy.

ESSENCE
it is possible  to communicate  relatively  accurately,  but in the case of writing, as it is difficult to communicate
in consideration  of various  environments,  a certain  format is required.  For example,  when writing  an email, you
need a certain strategy  for how to write it, such as a subject  line, a summary  of the important  points, a full
text, and an extra explanation.
The most important  type of communication  is gestures  (non-verbal).  It can be thought  that gestures  are less
definitive  than speech or voice, but not only logics but non-verbal  elements  significantly  affect the delivery  of
communication.

Nonverbal  gestures
(Change  in breathing  or skin
color, tear, sweat, glaring,
eye contact,  avoidance,  step
back, approach,  etc.)
For example,  if your voice is more attractive  than any other part of your face and body, like many successful
movie stars with good voice, it is easy to focus the other person’s  attention  on your words. Just putting  on a
bright smile on your face while talking to the other person  will help you achieve  a certain level of communica-
tion goals.
O02 Methods  of Business  Communication
A) Bottom-up,  top-down,  horizontal  business  communication
Business  communication  can be largely divided into two types: horizontal  communication  and vertical com-
munication.  Horizontal  communication  means communication  between  colleagues,  and vertical  communication
means communication  between  supervisors  and subordinates.  In each case, a different  way of communication
is required.
Vertical communication  can be divided into top-down  communication  and bottom-up  communication.  Top-
down communication  includes  instructions,  commands,  and deliveries  from top to bottom of the organization,

and bottom-up  communication  includes  reports from bottom to top of the organization.  In general,  formal
communication  with the boss requires  a certain standardized  document  format  and delivery  technique.
Horizontal  communication  refers to communication  between  members  or departments  at a similar level within
an organization.  In the process  of performing  work, it is possible  to achieve common  goals through  organic
interactions  within a functionally  divided organization.  In recent  years, the importance  of horizontal  communi-
cation is increasing,  as new problems  or challenges  of increasingly  complex  and converged  forms are emerging.
Examples  include prior consultation,  circulation,  committees,  and task forces.
B) Communication  channels  and information  integrity
There are many channels  for business  communication,  but usually meetings,  emails, phone calls, reports, and
official letters are used. The amount  and diversity  of information  that can be delivered  are different  for each
communication  channel.  The amount  and degree of diversity  of information  that can be delivered  by commu-
nication  channel  is called information  integrity.

<Figure  4> Communication  Channel  Selection  According  to Information  Integrity
In the figure below, you can see that, in the case of direct conversation,  the level of information  integrity  is
very high in that the amount  of information  to be transmitted  is large, can be delivered  in various languages,
and the speed of delivery  and feedback  are also fast. In contrast,  mediums  such as official letters have very
low level of information  integrity.  E-mail, which is frequently  used for business  communication  in recent years,
has a moderate  level of information  integrity.  E-mail can help overcome  time and space constraints  of a face-
to-face  conversation,  and deliver a message  at a fast speed and attach various  documents,  and unlike phone
calls, the content  of e-mails  sent and received  becomes  a record of your communication.
Table 2 shows the features  and strengths  and weaknesses  of discussions,  meetings,  and e-mails.
