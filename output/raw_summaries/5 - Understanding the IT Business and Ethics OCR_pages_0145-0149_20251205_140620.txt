### 3. Cloud Computing

**What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud computing allows users to access IT resources (networks, servers, storage, applications) over the Internet as a service, on demand, without owning the underlying infrastructure. It's like a rental business for IT.

**Origins:**
*   An old concept that gained market interest due to global economic recession and the need for cost reduction.
*   Improved virtualization technology made it possible to integrate distributed IT resources into a single system for service.

**Characteristics of Cloud Computing:**
*   **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can provision computing capabilities (e.g., server time, network storage) as needed, automatically, without human interaction with each service provider. Minimal infrastructure investment for customers.
*   **Scalability:** Resources can be rapidly provisioned or released to meet changing demands.
*   **Broad Network Access:** Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (e.g., thick/thin clients).
*   **Resource Pooling:** The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with resources dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand.
*   **Measured Service:** Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both providers and consumers (pay-as-you-go).

**Cloud Computing Stakeholders:**
1.  **Vendors:** Provide hardware, solutions, and applications to cloud service providers.
2.  **Providers:** Offer cloud services to users (e.g., Amazon, Salesforce, Google).
3.  **Users:** Individuals or corporations who actually use cloud services, paying only for what they use and scaling resources in real-time.

**Cloud Service Technologies (Hierarchy):**
*   **Cloud Client:** Technologies for utilizing cloud services (e.g., lightweight terminals, mobile cloud tech).
*   **Cloud Service & Applications:** Technologies for delivering various cloud services as software or applications.
*   **Cloud Platform:** Technologies providing the basic functional environment for easily developing services (e.g., PaaS).
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Technologies providing fundamental resources like servers, storage, and networks as services (e.g., IaaS).

**Standardization & Quality:**
*   Standardization focuses on cloud security, clients, and platform virtualization to ensure compatibility.
*   Guidelines for managing quality indicators (SLA) are crucial for market growth.

**Cloud Service Models (Based on IT Resources):**
1.  **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
    *   **What:** Users access applications over the Internet via a web browser.
    *   **How:** Applications are hosted and managed by the provider.
    *   **Examples:** Google Gmail, MS Office 365.
2.  **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
    *   **What:** Providers offer an environment for developing and running web applications.
    *   **How:** Includes operating systems, programming languages, databases, web servers. App development technologies must be modularized and standardized.
    *   **Examples:** Salesforce.com's Force.com, Google App Engine.
3.  **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
    *   **What:** Providers offer virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networks.
    *   **How:** Users manage operating systems, applications, and sometimes middleware. Requires significant infrastructure (data centers, capital, power).
    *   **Examples:** Amazon EC2 & S3.

**Cloud Service Deployment Models (Based on Configuration):**
1.  **Public Cloud:**
    *   **What:** Services shared by multiple users over the Internet.
    *   **Management:** Provided and managed by a third-party cloud service provider.
2.  **Private Cloud:**
    *   **What:** An IT environment exclusively deployed on a company's or organization's intranet.
    *   **Management:** Controlled by the company or organization itself.
3.  **Hybrid Cloud:**
    *   **What:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    *   **Benefit:** Offers scalability and allows specialized applications to run in parallel.

**Advantages of Cloud Computing:**
*   Users can purchase, design, and install services directly without IT manager intervention.
*   Improves efficiency by sharing IT resources.
*   Avoids costs associated with owning IT resources.
*   Enables new business models by merging with different services.

### 4. Virtualization

**What is Virtualization?**
Virtualization is the abstraction of computer resources. It's a technique that hides the physical characteristics of computer resources from other systems, applications, and end-users. It allows:
*   Creating multiple logical resources from a single physical resource.
*   Creating a single logical resource from multiple physical resources.

**Types of Virtualization:**
1.  **Application Virtualization:**
    *   Users access needed applications instantly without installing them on their individual PCs.
2.  **Desktop Virtualization:**
    *   **Server-Side:** Users can virtually own a heterogeneous desktop (e.g., Windows Vista, Windows 7) from a server.
    *   **Client-Side:** Enables heterogeneous virtual desktops directly on individual PCs.
    *   **Benefit:** Allows separation of personal and corporate workspaces.

ESSENCE
There are three reasons  driving the spread of the infrastructure  for M2M communication.  The first reason is the
expanding  wireless  networks.  The coverage  of wireless  networks  and the guaranteed  service stability  greatly
facilitated  the growth of M2M communication.  The second reason is the declining  prices and increasing  availability
of telecommunication  modules.  The telecommunication  module market is growing  at more than 30% per year, but
prices are gradually  decreasing,  and market penetration  is rapidly increasing.  The third reason is the declining  price
of sensors.  As the market  expands,  sensor  technology  is getting more sophisticated,  but prices are falling, allowing
companies  that provide sensing-based  services  at low cost. These sensors  are expanding  from simple monitoring  to
fault and accident  detection,  asset management,  and customer  usage management  information.  Furthermore,  the
applications  of these sensors  are becoming  increasingly  diverse.  Starting  first with simple monitoring,  sensors  are now
being used to detect  malfunctions  and accidents,  manage  assets, and extract  data about customer  usage levels.
Typically,  the process  of developing  an M2M device first begins with developing  a module that contains  a mobile
chipset. Then the device is developed using the module.  An M2M device can be roughly  designed  as an object
consisting  of a chipset and a module and largely divided into three parts: a sensor/input&output  unit, a data
processing  unit, and a communication  module.

The data acquired  through  the input&output  uniit is processed  by the data processing  unit before it is sent to the
communication  module.  RS-232  or USB is used when sending  the data from the processing  unit to the communication
module.  The technology  used in M2M communication  defines  the technology  needed  for services  at the service layer
and takes a typical top-down  approach  to design the the lower layer to follow the definition  set by the service layer.
However,  this approach  can disrupt the standardization  and public sharing  of the technology  and hinder the growth
of the market. Therefore,  standardization  of the M2M environment  is a critical task for stimulating  the growth of the
market.
Q@loT (Internet  of Things)
The diffusion  of M2M technology  has opened  wide the era of loT which creates  an environment  where communication
takes place not only between  objects but everything  from people to objects, spaces are connected  to the Internet
to create, collect,  share, and utilize information  about everything,  Unlike the recent explosion  of public interest  in loT,
the idea of loT was already commercialized  a long time agolts  just that loT has been spreading/evolving  gradually

due to a combination  of factors at play such as the technology  development  levels and the economic  conditions.  In
recent years, buzzwords  describing  a completedly  connected  world (M2M, loT and Internet  of Everything)  are being
discussed  so much that it has become  rather  diffcult  to distinguish  the difference  between  such words.The  difference
between  the approaches  taken by M2M and loT is in how connections  are made. As mentioned  earlier, as M2M
evolved  in each industry  sector, it became  specialized to the particular  sector it served. loT is the effort to connect
these disparate  M2M technologies  under the universal  communication  network  umbrella  we call the Internet  so that
businesses  could offer more diverse and dynamic  services.  There are many different  perspectives  to M2M, but if they
are grouped  by different  types of services,  some of the typical examples  can be listed as follows.
