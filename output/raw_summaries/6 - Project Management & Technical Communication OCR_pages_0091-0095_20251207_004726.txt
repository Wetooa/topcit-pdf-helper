## Project Schedule Management: Learning Guide (Pages 91-95)

### 1. Core Concept & Importance

*   **Problem**: Overconfidence in resources leads to project delays and missed deadlines.
*   **Solution**: Project schedules must be realistic, based on the project's **scope** and available **resource capacity**.
*   **Goal**: Systematically manage the project timeline to ensure completion on time.

### 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1.  Explain the concept and process of schedule management.
2.  Understand schedule management techniques.
3.  Identify schedule compression techniques (Crashing, Fast Tracking - mentioned as keywords, but not detailed in this extract).

### 3. Key Terminology

*   **Schedule Management Process**: Planning, activity definition, activity sequencing, activity resource estimation, activity duration estimation, schedule development, schedule control.
*   **Activity Duration Estimation Techniques**: One-point estimating, three-point estimating, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, expert judgment.
*   **Schedule Management Techniques**: Critical Path Method (CPM), Critical Chain Method (CCM).
*   **Compression Techniques**: Crashing, Fast Tracking.
*   **Schedule**: A display of activity start and finish dates, derived from analyzing durations, relationships, resources, costs, and uncertainties. More than a simple timetable.
*   **Sprint**: In Agile, a short, iterative development cycle for a part of the project.
*   **Retrospective**: A meeting at the end of a sprint to discuss progress and adjust future plans.

### 4. Why Schedule Management Matters

*   Projects have a definite **start and end date** (delivery date).
*   Systematic schedule management helps prevent project failure due to delays.
*   It breaks down projects into smaller, manageable units, allowing for iterative adjustment.
*   **Benefits of a well-written schedule**:
    *   **Feasible Planning**: Sets realistic timelines.
    *   **Project Overview**: Provides a complete picture for the team and stakeholders (clients, management).
    *   **Effective Control**: Identifies areas needing focused management.
    *   **Clear Communication**: Conveys a lot of project information efficiently.

### 5. Modern Approaches: Agile Process

*   Driven by intense market competition and diverse technical development.
*   **Agile Process** (e.g., XP, Scrum) uses rapid, iterative development.
*   **Sprints**: Short development cycles for parts of the project, repeated to increase completion.
*   **Retrospective**: A procedure at the end of each sprint for team communication and realistic adjustment of future plans.

### 6. Understanding the Project Schedule

*   **What is a Schedule?**
    *   A visual representation (tables, graphs, network diagrams) of project activities' start and finish dates.
    *   It's based on comprehensive analysis of activity duration, dependencies, resources (human/physical), costs, project uncertainty, and working conditions.
    *   **Distinction**: A schedule is *not* a simple timetable; it logically links factors affecting project time and cost.

*   **Common Schedule Formats**:
    *   **Network Schedule**:
        *   Illustrates relationships between activities.
        *   Used for project planning.
        *   Good for showing individual activity progress.
    *   **Gantt Chart**:
        *   Mainly for reporting to management.
        *   Shows when milestones are executed.
    *   **Milestone Chart**:
        *   Simplest form, suitable for high-level reporting (clients, management).
        *   Focuses on important project checkpoints (milestones) with zero duration.

### 7. Schedule Management Process

Schedule management involves a series of steps to plan and control the project timeline:

1.  **Schedule Management Planning**:
    *   Develop a **Project Schedule Management Plan**.
    *   This detailed plan is created by sharing project approval, project management plan, and rules for measuring the schedule with the team.
    *   It's a crucial document; any changes require approval from the project steering committee and must be recorded.

2.  **Activity Definition**:
    *   Identify and document all activities needed to create project deliverables.
    *   Based on project scope and requirements.
    *   Activities are refined iteratively through **Rolling Wave Planning** and **Work Breakdown System (WBS)**.

3.  **Activity Sequencing**:
    *   Arrange defined activities in a logical order by identifying relationships between them.
    *   **Logical Relationships between Activities**:
        *   **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Successor activity cannot start until predecessor activity finishes. (Most common)
            *   *Example: Develop product AFTER screen design finishes.*
        *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Successor activity cannot finish until predecessor activity finishes.
            *   *Example: Analysis finishes ONLY when writing AND deletion of text finish.*
        *   **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Successor activity cannot start until predecessor activity starts.
            *   *Example: Development activities can start ONLY when planning begins.*
        *   **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Successor activity cannot finish until predecessor activity starts.
            *   *Example: In 3-shift work, Shift B (successor) can leave only when Shift A (predecessor) comes to work.*

4.  **Activity Duration Estimation**:
    *   Estimate the time required for each activity, considering allocated resources.
    *   **Estimation Methods**:
        *   **Expert Judgment**: An expert uses experience from similar projects to estimate resources and duration.
        *   **Analogous Estimating**: Refers to similar past projects for estimation (less accurate than parametric methods, but good when data is limited).
        *   **Three-point Estimating**: A risk-based technique, especially useful with limited experience. It uses three estimates:
            *   **Optimistic (O)**: Best-case scenario, shortest duration.
            *   **Most Likely (M)**: Realistic estimate, average duration.
            *   **Pessimistic (P)**: Worst-case scenario, longest duration.
            *   **Calculation Formula (from PERT)**: `(O + 4M + P) / 6`
            *   *Example: If O=4 days, M=6 days, P=10 days, then Duration = (4 + 4*6 + 10) / 6 = 6.3 days.*
            *   **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**: The technique behind three-point estimation. It predicts project schedule while considering various risk factors and fluctuations.

5.  **Schedule Development**:
    *   Create the final project schedule by combining and analyzing activity sequences, estimated durations, resource needs, and any schedule constraints.

6.  **Schedule Control**: (Mentioned as a process step, but details are not provided in this extract).
    *   This involves monitoring project status, managing changes to the schedule, and influencing factors that create schedule changes.

If you are overconfident  about resource  capacity  for scheduling,  it is difficult to comply with the
delivery  date of the project, if the schedule  is delayed in the latter half of the project. Therefore,  the
product  schedule  should be based on the scope of requirements  and the capacity  of resources.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
+ Preview  for practical  business
One of the characteristics  of the project is that “it has the beginning  and the end’, which means
that “there is a fixed timeline”  or “a delivery  date’. In other words, as time precisely  heads toward  the
delivery  date, it is necessary  not only to work efficiently  work in the project execution  process, but
also to minimize  errors or unnecessary  work.
Nevertheless,  there are cases in which the delivery  date of the project is delayed,  resulting  in a
“project  failure”.
Accordingly,  an approach  to systematically  manage  the schedule  is being adopted, and one is to
break down the project schedule  into smaller  units and repeat them to fulfill the schedule.  In other
words, you adjust the schedule  according  to the situation  while estimating  the future schedule
based on the tasks already  completed.  This concept  is nothing  new but has become  more necessary
as market  competition  intensifies  or technical  development  diversifies.
One example  is the Agile Process,  which is based on rapid and iterative  development  through
XP (eXtreme  Programming)  or Scrum. In other words, a short schedule  of developing  part of  the
whole is called a “sprint”, and these sprints are performed  several times to increase  the degree of
completion.  At the end of the sprint, there is a procedure  called “retrospective”  to allow participants
to communicate  in a free atmosphere  and to realistically  adjust future plans.

01 Concept  and Process  of Schedule  Management
A) Concept  of schedule  management
@ Schedule
A schedule  is a display of the start and finish dates of each of the activities  that make up the project  and can
be expressed  in various  formats  such as tables, graphs,  and network  diagrams.
However,  the date information  displayed  in the schedule  is determined  based on a comprehensive  analysis  of
the duration,  sequential  relationships,  human and physical resources  required  of the activities,  input costs, the
uncertainty  of the project progress,  and the working  conditions.  It is distinct  from the timetable  for a simple
goal.
@ Importance  of Schedule
The schedule  is distinguished  from the timetable  as it describes  in a logical manner  the factors  that affect the
overall project  execution  time and cost, such as the dependency  between  activities  and the type and quantity
of resources  required  for each activity,  in addition  to the arbitrary  relationship  between  work and time. Writing
a schedule  is important  as it functions  as follows:
+ Useful planning:  you can set a feasible  timeline  by reasonably  estimating  the duration  of the project.
+A bird's eye view of the project: you can get a full understanding  of what the project is and how it is
executed.  In addition,  the completed  schedule  is a good tool to explain the project team's plans to
stakeholders  such as clients and the management.
+ Effective  control: resources can be concentrated  by identifying  areas that need intensive  management
through  schedule  analysis.
+ Effective  communication:  the schedule  itself expresses  a lot of information  about the project. Thus, a well-
written  schedule  allows for effective  communication.
® Format  of Schedule
Schedules  can take many formats.  The most common  schedule  formats  in project management  are as follows.
