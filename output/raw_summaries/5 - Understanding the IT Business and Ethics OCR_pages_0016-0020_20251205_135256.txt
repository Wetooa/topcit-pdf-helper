*   **Purpose:** To maximize corporate value by optimizing management through IT integration and utilizing the latest technologies.

**B. Evolution of the IT Business Concept**
*   **20th Century:** IT (computers) primarily used in dedicated computing rooms, limited integration into daily work.
*   **1990s:** With web technology, computers became more common in general work environments.
*   **21st Century:**
    *   IT permeates all industries, leading to a digital-centered lifestyle.
    *   IT plays a key role in business processes and enterprise-wide decision-making.
*   **Around 2005:** The concept of "IT business" gained recognition, especially in industries where IT was critical to products.
*   **Post-2010:** IT became tightly merged with business processes to gain competitive advantage. Decision-makers recognized IT's crucial role in acquiring high-quality data in a dynamic environment.
*   **Concept Shift:** From "IT utilization" (IT as a mere tool) to "IT integration" (IT and business closely merged).

**C. IT Business Lifecycle**
An ongoing cycle to develop and deliver IT business services:
1.  **Strategy & Planning:** Develop a strategy and plan for adopting IT business.
2.  **Adoption:** Begin the process of integrating IT.
3.  **Process:** Execute the IT business operations.
4.  **Service:** Deliver IT business services that generate earnings.

### 2. Strategic Alignment of Business and IT

**A. Importance of Alignment**
*   IT is not just a tool; it's interdependent with business strategy and objectives.
*   This interdependence strengthens a company's business model competitiveness and creates new business value.

**B. Business-IT Alignment Defined**
*   It's how IT application programs, IT infrastructure, and the IT organization support and realize a company's business strategy and processes.

**C. Strategic Alignment Model (SAM)**
This model illustrates the strategic links between business and IT using two main dimensions:
1.  **Strategic Fit:** Focuses on the harmony between internal and external factors.
    *   **External Focus:** Aligning business strategy with the external business environment.
    *   **Internal Focus:** Aligning organizational structure and processes with internal management.
2.  **Functional Integration:** Focuses on the interplay between business and IT.
    *   **Business:** Relates to business strategy and business processes.
    *   **IT:** Relates to IT strategy, IT infrastructure, and IT processes.

*To achieve strategic alignment, these four areas (Business Strategy, IT Strategy, Organizational Infrastructure & Processes, IT Infrastructure & Processes) must complement each other.*

    *   New technologies are first introduced.
    *   Early public interest and expectations are high.
2.  **Peak of Inflated Expectations:**
    *   Hype and publicity reach their maximum.
    *   Expectations often exceed the technology's actual capabilities, creating an "inflated bubble."
3.  **Trough of Disillusionment:**
    *   The "bubble bursts" as technologies fail to meet exaggerated expectations.
    *   Interest wanes, and investment may decrease.
4.  **Slope of Enlightenment:**
    *   A period of revival where the technology's true potential and practical applications become clearer.
    *   Expectations climb steadily again, based on real-world use cases.
5.  **Plateau of Productivity:**
    *   The technology achieves mainstream adoption.
    *   Its benefits are widely demonstrated, and it generates steady, reliable value.

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
+ Preview  for practical  business
Alibaba,  a Chinese  e-commerce  company,  was listed on the New York Stock Exchange  on the morning  of
September  19, 2014. What's amazing  about Alibaba is that on the day of its listing, its stock price rose by
38 percent  to $231.4 billion (241.6 trillion won) in market  value, and Jack Ma, Alibaba’s  largest  shareholder,
quickly  became  China's  richest  man, with $25 billion (26 trillion won) in assets.
In 1999, Jack Ma, along with seventeen  friends,  founded  Alibaba,  an online shopping  mall that sells Chinese |
SME products  to companies  around the world from his apartment.  Alibaba’s  rapid growth began in 2000
with a $20 million investment  from Softbank's  Masayoshi  Son. Following  in the footsteps  of Alibaba a B2B
service,  the company  launched  "Taobao,"  an online shopping  mall for individuals  (C2C), “tmall.com’  an online
department  store for wealthy  customers,  and "Alipay,  an electronic  payment  service.  Today, Alibaba Group
has become  the world’s leading  online shopping  mall and fintech corporation.  Alibaba is also one of the
finest models  of success  in the IT business.  So what is the key success  factor (CSF) that has enabled  the
company  to out-maneuver  eBay, the global company  that previously  occupied  the dominant  position  in the
Chinese  market?
First, there are no transaction  fees at Alibaba's  online shopping  mall. Profits are generated  from advertising |
and search services,  Second,  the company  deployed  an innovative  logistics  system that can deliver  goods
to any address  in the vast Chinese  territory  in just 1~2 days, and, using the ‘Alipay’  service,  it tured China's
unreliable  e-commerce  into a trading channel trusted by the trading parties.  Third, it worked aggressively
to meet customer  requirements.  It supported  the practice  of ‘chat-purchase’  when shopping  through  the
Internet,  whereby  customers  can negotiate  the price of a product  by chatting  before making a purchase
decision.  Fourth, CEO Ma Yun's vision and strategy  inspired his employees  to dedicate  themselves  to the
company  and drove them to work with all they have got.
As we saw earlier, Alibaba provides  the three elements  of competitiveness  that all companies  must have:
price, quality, and customer-friendly  services.  And, most importantly,  the organization  is very well led by the
CEO thanks to his vision and strategy. Alibaba is a perfect  example  of why strategy  is so important  in the
IT business,

[Fig.1] IT  Business  Lifecycle  and Interrelationship  Diagram
An IT business  is pursued  as a series of steps after developing  a strategy  and establishing  a plan for adopting  an
IT business.  The IT business  process  begins right after the adoption  of the IT business.  The ultimate  output  of
this process  is an IT business  service that will generate  earnings  for the company.  This cycle then “recycles”  itself
perpetually  as IT becomes  integrated  into the company’s  business,  Thereafter,  the direction  of the IT business  can be
corrected  or improved  by evaluating  its performance  on a continuous  basis.
The management  environment  surrounding  a company  responds  with sensitivity  to changes  in politics, economy,
society, culture, and technology.  Further, the management  environment  evolves continuously  to become  fully
optimized  for the objective  of maximizing  corporate  value. As a core element  for optimizing  the management  of a
company,  IT’s integration with the service (which utilizes the latest technologies)  sets the direction  in which the IT
business  will evolve.
