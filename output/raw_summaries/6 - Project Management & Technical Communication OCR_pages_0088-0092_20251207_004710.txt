## Project Management & Technical Communication Learning Guide

### I. Scope Controlling

**A. Definition:**
*   Monitoring project status and product scope.
*   Managing them according to formal procedures.

**B. Key Activities:**
*   Processing requested changes.
*   Implementing recommended corrective actions.
*   Implementing preventive actions throughout the project.

**C. Importance of Change Control:**
*   Changes to the baseline scope are common.
*   Scope changes impact schedule and cost.
*   All scope changes **must** be reported to the **Project Change Control Board (CCB)**.
*   Changes are reviewed for project-wide impacts and processed formally.

### II. Scope Management Technique: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**A. Purpose:**
*   The primary tool for scope management.
*   Requires collecting customer requirements and preparing a requirements definition document.

**B. Requirements Gathering Techniques (Prerequisite for WBS):**
1.  **Interview:** Systematic oral interviews with individuals or groups to derive requirements.
2.  **Prototyping:**
    *   Promptly and schematically building a partial or full system.
    *   Better than specifications for user understanding and feedback.
3.  **Moderator Meeting:**
    *   Generates ideas for products, services, or improvements.
    *   A moderator ensures predefined goals are met during group discussions.
4.  **Document Analysis:**
    *   Derives system requirements by examining existing documents and related data.
    *   Includes business plans, market research, contracts, RFPs, SOWs, existing guides, training materials, problem reports, similar product documents, and existing system designs.

**C. Concept of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**
*   **Definition:** A hierarchical structure that breaks down project deliverables into manageable tasks.
*   **Work Package:**
    *   Each subtask item in the WBS is called a work package.
    *   Example: An "online bulletin board" project could have work packages like "Writing," "Deleting," "Editing," and "Uploading."

**D. Structure of WBS:**
*   Most commonly represented as a **tree diagram**.
*   Arranges components in a **parent-to-child relationship** for intuitive hierarchy.

**E. Components of WBS:**
1.  **Work Package:**
    *   The lowest-level unit of the WBS.
    *   Cost and duration can be planned, estimated, monitored, and controlled at this level.
2.  **Code of Account:**
    *   A unique identification or numbering system.
    *   Assigns unique numbers to each work package.
3.  **WBS Dictionary:**
    *   A detailed description for each work package.
    *   Includes outline, schedule, person in charge, and budget.
4.  **RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix):**
    *   A standard that defines who is responsible for each WBS element.
    *   Identifies approvers, quality reviewers, and input managers.

**F. How to Create a WBS (Principles):**
*   WBS is created by breaking down the scope statement into small, manageable work packages.
1.  **Deliverable-based:** Focus on tangible deliverables to effectively control and manage scope.
2.  **Detailed Segmentation:**
    *   The lowest WBS unit typically has a duration of **~80 hours (2 weeks)** for effective performance control.
    *   Units should be processable by project members within 1-2 weeks.
3.  **Hierarchical Representation:** Defined to clearly show sequential relationships or correlations between WBS elements.

### III. Schedule Management Fundamentals

**A. Importance of Schedule Management:**
*   Projects have a "fixed timeline" or "delivery date."
*   Requires efficient work and minimizing errors to meet deadlines.
*   Delays can lead to "project failure."

**B. Recent Trends & Key Issue (Resource Capacity):**
*   Overconfidence in resource capacity often leads to project delays.
*   Project schedules **must** be based on realistic scope requirements and available resource capacity.

**C. Key Concepts & Processes:**
1.  **Schedule Management Process Steps:**
    *   Schedule management planning
    *   Activity definition
    *   Activity sequencing
    *   Activity resource estimation
    *   Activity duration estimation
    *   Schedule development
    *   Schedule control
2.  **Activity Duration Estimation Techniques:**
    *   One-point estimating
    *   Three-point estimating
    *   Analogous estimating
    *   Parametric estimating
    *   Expert judgment
3.  **Schedule Management Techniques:**
    *   Critical Path Method (CPM)
    *   Critical Chain Method (CCM)
4.  **Schedule Compression Techniques:**
    *   Crashing
    *   Fast Tracking

### IV. Modern Approaches to Schedule Management: Agile Process

**A. Context and Need:**
*   Systematically managing schedules is crucial.
*   Involves breaking down schedules into smaller, iterative units.
*   Adjusts schedules based on completed tasks and estimates future work.
*   Becoming more necessary due to intense market competition and technical diversification.

**B. Agile Process Overview (XP, Scrum):**
*   An example of systematic schedule management.
*   Based on rapid and iterative development (e.g., eXtreme Programming (XP) or Scrum).

**C. Key Agile Concepts:**
1.  **Sprint:**
    *   A short, fixed-duration period for developing a part of the whole project.
    *   Multiple sprints are performed to incrementally increase the degree of completion.
2.  **Retrospective:**
    *   A procedure at the end of each sprint.
    *   Allows participants to communicate openly and adjust future plans realistically based on lessons learned.

the requirements  and criteria for delivery.  Examples  of official inspection  include Review  and Walkthrough.
© Scope Controlling
It is the process  of monitoring  project status and product range and managing  them according  to formal
procedures.
It makes sure that requested  changes,  recommended  corrective  actions, and preventive  actions are processed
throughout  the project. Requests  for changes  to the baseline scope made through scope definition  in the
project  design and analysis  stage are frequent  in practice.  Since scope changes  are closely  related to schedule
and cost, they should be reported  to the Project Change Control Board (CCB), reviewed for their impacts
throughout  the project, and approved  and processed  according  to formal procedures.
O02 Scope Management  Technique
A) Work breakdown  structure  (WBS)
A work breakdown  system is created, in general,  for scope management.  In order to desgin work breakdown
system, customer  requirements  must be collected,  and the requirements  definition  document  must be pre-
pared.
Requirements  are generally  gathered  in the following  ways.
<Table 36> Scope Management  Techniques
Technique Explanation
Interview + A systematic  approach  to derive requirements  through  an oral interview  with individuals  and groups
Prototyping+ A technique  to promptly  and schematically  build a system  to be developed  in full or part
+ Prototyping  is better than specification  to enhance  the understanding  of and feedback  from users
Moderator
meeting+ A technique  to generate  ideas for specific  products,  services  and opportunities  for improvement
+ The moderator  ensures  to achieve  intended  goals by faithfully  implementing  the pre-defined  contents
for specific  issues when conducting  group discussions
Document
analysis+ A technique  to derive system requirements  by examining  documents  and related data on the existing
system
+ Analysis  of business  plans, market  research  results,  contract  details, RFP, SOW, related records,
existing  business  guides/procedures,  training  materials,  documents  related to similar products,  problem
reports,  customer  proposal  records,  and existing  system  design  documents
@ Concept  of Work Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)
The work breakdown  system is a hierarchical  structure  of tasks that are classified  based on project  deliverables
and broken down into manageable  packages.  Each subtask  item in the work breakdown  system  is called a
work package.  For example,  a project that creates an online bulletin board can be divided into work packages
of “Writing”,  “Deleting”,  “Editing”,  and “Uploading”.  The following  is an example of WBS created by Microsoft
Project.

A tree diagram  is the most common  structure  of WBS. It arranges  components  in a parent-to-child  relationship,
which facilitates  an intuitive  understanding  of the hierarchy.
@® Components  of Work Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)
The elements  of the work breakdown  system include Work Package,  Code of Account, WBS dictionary,  and
RAM, and their explanations  are as follows:
