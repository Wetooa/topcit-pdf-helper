## **Learning Guide: Project Evaluation**

This guide covers the essentials of project evaluation, its stages, and benefits.

### **1. What is Project Evaluation?**

*   **Definition:** Project evaluation is the comprehensive process of assessing a project from its beginning (investment) to its completion and even after, including post-completion analysis.
*   **Purpose:** To systematically manage and assess projects, especially given their significant investment and resource requirements.
*   **Three Key Perspectives for Evaluation:**
    1.  **Financial:** Evaluates project investment and Return on Investment (ROI).
    2.  **Management:** Assesses project progress in terms of schedule, scope, quality, and risk management.
    3.  **Technical:** Examines the technologies and solutions applied within the project.

### **2. Role of the Project Management Office (PMO)**

The **PMO (Project Management Office)** is central to integrated project management and evaluation. Its functions include:

*   **Investment:** Decision-making, entry, management, and evaluation.
*   **Planning & Execution:** Scope, schedule, cost, and quality management.
*   **Resources:** Resource acquisition, manpower management, and purchase management.
*   **Collaboration:** Communication and stakeholder management.
*   **Risk Management.**
*   **Analysis:** Results analysis and gap analysis.

### **3. Key Project Evaluation Items**

A fair evaluation after a project is completed is crucial due to the substantial resources invested. This helps assess the project's value and how it's perceived. Common evaluation items include:

*   **Return on Investment (ROI)**
*   **Consistency with Business Strategy**
*   **Sales Increase Effect**
*   **Cost Reduction Effect**
*   **User Satisfaction**
*   **Competitive Differentiation**
*   **Process Improvement**
*   **Recycle/Reusability**

*Project managers* must use project plans and Business Cases to quantitatively assess if project goals were met, which supports continuous process improvement.

### **4. Project Evaluation Stages**

Project evaluation is performed at different times throughout its lifecycle to analyze its contribution to business goals.

| Evaluation Stage     | Timing & Purpose                                                                      | Key Focus / Activities                                                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ex-ante Evaluation** | **Before Project Start:** To analyze feasibility and support IT investment decisions.    | *   Assess project feasibility in advance. <br> *   Prioritize multiple potential projects. <br> *   Decide whether to proceed with an IT project and select alternatives. <br> *   Often done annually for budget allocation.         |
| **Interim Evaluation** | **During the Project:** To monitor progress, supervise, and manage risks.               | *   Frequent evaluation to ensure project alignment. <br> *   Supervision, inspection, and risk management during execution. <br> *   Manage IT investment risks to achieve goals.                                                     |
| **Ex-post Evaluation** | **After Project Completion:** To verify effectiveness, confirm management goals, and plan improvements. | *   Conducted a specific period after completion (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually, annually). <br> *   Check if company management goals for IT investment were achieved. <br> *   Confirm project effectiveness and investment feasibility. <br> *   Establish future improvement plans and enhance IT operation efficiency. |

### **5. Benefits of Project Evaluation**

The three-step evaluation process provides significant advantages:

*   **Verifies IT Investment Effectiveness:** Confirms that IT investments successfully support business goals.
*   **Captures Lessons Learned:** Gathers insights to improve performance for future projects.
*   **Identifies Improvement Points:** Pinpoints areas for project progress enhancement and helps develop improvement plans.
*   **Fosters Continuous Improvement:** Leads to the progressive and ongoing enhancement of the overall project management process.

and third, a technical  perspective.  From a financial  standpoint,  investment  and ROI are evaluated.  From a
management  point of view, the process  of project progress  (schedule,  scope, quality, risk management,  etc.)
is evaluated,  and from a technical  point of view, it is evaluated  from the perspective  of technologies  and solu-
tions applied to the project.
B) Project  evaluation
As a project  requires a lot of investment  management,  companies  generally  run multiple projects  and require
systematic  management.  Project  evaluation means evaluating  everything  from the start of the project  to the
project  investment  after the end of the project.

Just because  the project is completely  finished,  it doesn't  mean that everything  is finished.  Since a large num-
ber of personnel  and costs were invested  in one project,  it is necessary  to carry out a fair ex-post  evaluation
process.  The example  below shows evaluation  items for the value and perception  of the project information
system.

The result of the project below is an example  of evaluating  the project  goals speculated  in the project  charter
and the actual results after 4 months.  This helps to measure  monthly  project performance  based on monthly
sales and to derive future operations  and improvements  along with investment  evaluation  of the project.

Project managers  should check the project plan and Business  Case to determine  quantitatively  whether  the
project has reached  its goals, through project management  tools and evaluation,  thereby  actively  managing
and supporting  continuous  process  improvement.
C) Project  evaluation  stage and focal point
The project  evaluation  stage is a task that analyzes  how much the IT project  has contributed  to the achieve-
ment of business  goals from the three points of view previously  examined.  It can be divided into Ex-ante  eval-
uation, Interim evaluation,  and Ex-post  evaluation  depending  on when the project  is evaluated.
