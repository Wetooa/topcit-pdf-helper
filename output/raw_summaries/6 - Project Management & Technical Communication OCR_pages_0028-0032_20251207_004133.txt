## Learning Guide: Project Management & Technical Communication Essentials

### I. Key Analytical Principles

#### A. The 80-20 Rule (Pareto's Principle)
*   **Origin:** Discovered by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto.
*   **Concept:** States that roughly 20% of inputs or causes are responsible for 80% of outputs or effects.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   20% of customers generate 80% of sales.
        *   Solving the core 20% of problems tends to resolve 80% of all problems.
*   **Application:** Focus resources on the essential 20% causal variables of a problem to solve over 80% of it.

#### B. MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
*   **Concept:** A structuring principle used to break down information into components that are distinct (mutually exclusive) and cover all possibilities (collectively exhaustive).
*   **Application:** Useful for decomposing complex analyses (e.g., "Status Analysis") into manageable, comprehensive parts, often in a hierarchical tree form.

### II. Rational Decision-Making

#### A. Overview
*   **Definition:** A thinking technique for making the most efficient and effective decisions among various alternatives, aligning best with a given purpose.

#### B. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MADM)
*   **Purpose:** A technique for selecting the best alternative by considering multiple criteria or factors, rather than just one.
*   **Process:** Evaluates how well each factor (attribute of the object) meets the overall purpose, and reflects this in the final decision.

#### C. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
*   **Purpose:** A technique to make complex decisions by structuring information hierarchically.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Arrange decision information into a hierarchical tree.
    2.  Segment complex, non-quantifiable problems into smaller, understandable parts.
    3.  Evaluate segmented problems using pairwise comparisons.
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies complex problems, making elements easier for decision-makers to compare and judge.

### III. Essential Problem-Solving Skills

#### A. Definition
*   Problem-solving is the activity of recognizing and improving the gap between a desired state and the current state.
*   It requires continuously raising the "desired level" (quality threshold) through information collection and experience.

#### B. Key Factors to Improve Problem-Solving
1.  **Always Ask "Why":** Cultivate a strong sense of problem awareness by constantly questioning the root causes.
2.  **Develop an Active Attitude:** Embrace positive thinking and the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas to propose new solutions. Solutions rarely come from a single thought due to many variables.
3.  **Take Ownership:** See problems as your responsibility and be accountable for resolving them. Avoid blaming others ("passing the buck") to genuinely solve problems and grow professionally.

### IV. Business Communication & Documentation

#### A. Importance of Business Documents
*   Most business activities rely on documentation.
*   Effective document writing skills, combined with oral communication, are crucial for success, especially in today's complex business environment.
*   Ability to write concise and clear business documents is highly valued.

#### B. Concept of Business Documents
*   **Definition:** All documents necessary for business activities, including process plans, reports, meeting minutes, and status updates.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Accuracy:** Must be accurately described in a standardized form to avoid misunderstanding.
    *   **Clarity:** Use concise phrases and objective expressions, avoiding lengthy or emotional language.
    *   **Intuitiveness:** Should be easy for the reader to understand.

#### C. Types of Business Documents

1.  **General Document Types (Most Common)**
    *   **Reports:** For reporting on business feasibility, product/idea, or business environment.
    *   **Proposals:** To obtain approval for business promotion of a product or idea.
    *   **Business Plans:** To prepare a commercialization plan after product/idea approval.
    *   **Letters:** Used to evaluate the value of a product or idea.
    *   **Manuals:** Documents explaining the details of a plan or product.

2.  **Detailed Types of Reports**
    *   **Based on Nature:**
        *   **Situation-Describing Report:**
            *   **Purpose:** Explains a situation objectively.
            *   **Method:** Uses the 5WIH principle (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How).
            *   **Priority:** Speed and accuracy (e.g., status reports, situation reports).
        *   **Judgment-Seeking Report:**
            *   **Purpose:** Seeks a decision or judgment.
            *   **Method:** Developed with a logical table of contents from the recipient's perspective, clearly presenting logic and reasons.
            *   **Priority:** Logic and reason (e.g., plan reports, countermeasure reports).
    *   **Based on Purpose:**
        *   **Information Reports:** Generated during the planning process (e.g., planning reports).
        *   **Management Reports:** Generated during the control process (e.g., inspection results reports).

#### D. Core Principle of Writing Business Documents: Understanding the Audience

*   **Rule:** Always create documents from the perspective of the **reader** or **final decision-maker**, not just your own.
*   **Considerations:** Comprehensively factor in the end-user's:
    *   Knowledge level
    *   Experience
    *   Needs
*   **End Consumer:** This can be management (e.g., a CEO, even if you report to an intermediary manager) or any ordinary member of an organization. Tailor content and detail accordingly.

For example,  “Status Analysis”  can be decomposed  into business  environment  and the 3C analysis  according
to the MECE principle  and if each component  of the next step is decomposed  into a tree form according  to the
MECE principle,  the given key content  can be checked.
© The 80-20 rule
The 80-20 rule was discovered  by an Italian economist  named Pareto who found out that the top 20% of
people have 80% of their total wealth, while analyzing  the distribution  of income in Europe. The 80-20 rule is
found in many cases, meaning  that the top 20% of customers  generate  80% of sales, and solving  the core 20%
of problems  tend to solve 80% of all problems.
Strategies  and Pareto’s  rule are very well matched.  As shown in the figure below, it can be understood  that if
resources  are concentrated  on solving  the causal variable  that is the essence  of the problem,  more than 80%
of the problem  can be solved as a result.
E) Rational  decision-making  techniques
Rational  thinking  is a technique  for making  the most efficient  and effective  decisions,  although  it cannot  accu-
rately verify truth/falsehood.  In other words, it can be said that it is a thinking  technique  for decision-making
that best suits the purpose among many alternatives.  There are the following  techniques  for making  this ra-
tional decision.
@ Multi-Criteria  Decision  Making(MADM)
The Multi-Criteria  Decision  Making is a technique  that considers  the criteria of various  factors rather  than one
criterion  in the process  of selecting  the best alternative.  The factors to be considered  refer to the attributes
that are characteristic  of the object, and the degree to which each factor meets the purpose  is evaluated  and
reflected  in the final decision-making.
@ Analytic  Hierarchy  Process  (AHP)
The AHP technique  is a technique  that leads to the final decision  by arranging  the information  of the situation
in hierarchical  tree for decision-making  and analyzing  it in stages. This technique  proceeds  by segmenting
complex  and non-quantifiable  problems  for easier analysis  and evaluating  the segmented  problems  through
pairwise comparisons.  Through  segmentation,  the problem is divided into a more understandable  form, and
decision  makers  can easily compare  and judge the elements  of each class.
F) Problem-solving  skills
Recently,  companies  are emphasizing  problem-solving  skills as a common  competency.  Problem  awareness
is necessary  to solve real problems.  In simple terms, problem-solving  can be described  as “an activity  that
recognizes  the gap between  the desired level and the current  level and improves  it’. In other words, since it is
difficult  to solve practical  problems  if you are complacent  with the current level or simply follow the existing
method,  efforts to continuously  raise the desired  level (quality  threshold) through  various  information collec-
tion and experiences  are required.  There are three main factors  that increase  the level of problem  solving.
@ Always  ask “why”
Above all, trying to recognize  the problem by questing  “why” is the essence  of problem-  solving. Of course, if
you do not recognize  the problem itself, you cannot solve the problem,  so you must always have a sense of

ESSENCE
problem  awareness  of asking “why” to enhance  problem-solving  skills.
@ Develop  an active attitude  to solve problems.
Since there are many variables  in every problem,  a solution may not come out from a momentary  thought.
Therefore,  positive thinking  about problem-solving  and the ability to transform  ideas are important.  This
is because  there are many cases where things that are completely  irrelevant  are linked together  and new
alternatives  are proposed.
© Take ownership  of your problems.
Ownership  that sees a problem as yours and accountability  that strives to resolve it are the most important.
When problem-solving  is difficult,  we often pass the buck, saying  “because  of what” or “because  of whom’, etc.
But in this way, you cannot solve problems  or become  a professional  employee.
