# Personal Information Protection: A Learning Guide

## 1. Introduction to Personal Information Security

### 1.1 Why Personal Information Protection Matters
Recent incidents highlight the critical need for personal information protection. Hackers have leaked millions of individuals' data, including:
*   Website IDs, names, dates of birth, emails, phone numbers, addresses, passport numbers.
*   Accommodation reservations and member information.

These breaches lead to severe penalties, such as large fines and corrective orders, for companies violating personal information protection laws like the **Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection, Etc. (Network Act)**. Violations include failures in access control, record preservation, encryption, and data expiration.

## 2. Understanding Personal Information

### 2.1 Definition of Personal Information
**Personal Information** is any information relating to a **living individual** that identifies them (e.g., name, resident registration number, image). It also includes information that, even if not identifying by itself, can be **easily combined** with other data to identify an individual.

*   **"Easily combined with other information"** means there's a high and possible chance of obtaining and combining additional information to identify someone.

### 2.2 Types of Personal Information
Personal information encompasses various categories:

*   **Identification:** Name, ID numbers, address, phone, email, date/place of birth, family details.
*   **Physical:** Biometrics (face, fingerprint, iris, voice, genetic info), height, weight. Medical/Health status, records, disabilities.
*   **Mental:** Preferences (rental/purchase history, website searches), inner secrets (thoughts, beliefs, religion, values, political views).
*   **Property:** Real estate, savings, income, credit card numbers, bank accounts. Credit rating, loan/collateral details.
*   **Social:** Education (grades, attendance, certificates), legal (criminal record, trial record), labor (workplace, experience, job evaluations), military service.
*   **Others:** Phone call history, website access history, emails/messages, GPS location data.

### 2.3 What is NOT Considered Personal Information
*   Information on deceased persons, corporations, groups, or objects.
*   Group statistics (aggregated data).
*   Information where it's difficult to identify a specific individual.

## 3. Key Terms in Personal Information Processing

*   **Information Subject:** The individual who can be identified by the collected and processed information.
*   **Processing:** Any act involving personal information, including collection, creation, storage, use, provision, disclosure, destruction, etc.
*   **Personal Information File:** Systematically arranged personal information for easy searching.
*   **Personal Information Processor:** Public institutions, corporations, organizations, businesses, or individuals who process personal information (themselves or via others) for business purposes.
*   **Privacy Policy:** A document outlining how an entity processes and protects personal information. It must detail processing purpose, retention period, data items, third-party provision, security measures, and the Personal Information Protection Officer.
*   **Personal Information Leakage:** Occurs when:
    *   Documents, storage devices, or computers with personal information are lost or stolen.
    *   Unauthorized persons access a personal information processing system/database.
    *   Personal information is incorrectly transmitted to unauthorized persons (intentional or negligent).
    *   Personal information is transferred to unauthorized persons or access is permitted to the processing system.
*   **Personal Information Exposure:** When general internet users can obtain others' personal information during normal internet use, without special methods like hacking.
*   **Permission to Access Personal Information:** The right of the personal information controller to access, view, record, correct, and delete personal information within the processing system.

## 4. Basic Principles of Personal Information Protection Act

*   **Scope:** Applies to all personal information processors (public and private sector). Covers handwritten documents and computer-processed information.
*   **Processing Restrictions:**
    *   Generally **prohibited** (unless the information subject consents or legal basis exists).
    *   **Sensitive information** (e.g., ideology, beliefs, health, sex life, criminal history) and **unique identification information** (e.g., resident registration number) require specific safety measures like encryption due to higher risks.
*   **Leakage Notification:** Mandatory notification of personal information leakage.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Provides for a group dispute mediation system and group lawsuits.
*   **Committee:** Presidential Personal Information Protection Committee.

## 5. Personal Information Processing Procedure & Guidelines

The Personal Information Protection Act outlines obligations at each stage:

### 5.1 Stages of Processing

1.  **Collection and Use:**
    *   **Restriction:** Only collect the minimum personal information required.
    *   **Management:** Strict restrictions on sensitive and unique identification information.
    *   **Website Membership:** Offer alternative sign-up without resident registration numbers.
    *   **Image Data:** Install/operate processing equipment, disclose management policies.
    *   **Management:** Designate Personal Information Protection Managers, implement safety measures.
2.  **Provision:**
    *   **Limitation:** Do not provide personal information to third parties or for unintended purposes without proper consent.
    *   **Outsourcing/Transfer:** Follow rules for outsourcing processing or transferring data during business changes.
3.  **Destruction:** Destroy personal information when no longer needed.
4.  **Reporting:** Report personal information leakage and damage.
5.  **Guarantee of Rights:**
    *   **Information Subjects' Rights:** Right to access, request correction, deletion, and destruction of personal information.
    *   **Dispute Resolution:** Utilize the Personal Information Dispute Mediation Committee.
    *   **Legal Action:** Class action lawsuits to suspend infringements.
6.  **Penalty and Transition Measures:** Penalties apply for violations.

### 5.2 Guidelines for Personal Information Agreement (Privacy Policy Development)

When collecting or providing customer personal information, companies and public institutions must follow government guidelines for obtaining consent. Information should be presented clearly for users to understand.

#### 5.2.1 Preparation Stage for Policy Development

1.  **Identify Required Personal Information:**
    *   Determine the **minimum personal information** needed for a task.
    *   Check for **unique identification information** (resident registration, driver's license, passport, alien registration numbers) or **sensitive information** (ideology, beliefs, health, sex life, criminal history), as these require separate processing and consent.
2.  **Identify Retention Period:**
    *   Confirm the retention period via privacy policy guidelines or relevant laws.
    *   Set the minimum necessary retention period if not specified.
3.  **Confirm Consent Requirement for Collection & Use:**
    *   **Generally, consent from the information subject is required** for collection and use.
    *   **Exceptions (consent NOT needed for collection/use):**
        *   Public institutions performing statutory duties.
        *   Legal obligations or specific statutory provisions.
        *   Inevitably necessary for executing a contract with the data subject.
        *   Manifestly necessary to protect life, body, or property from imminent danger (and consent can't be obtained).
        *   Necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller, clearly superior to data subject's rights.
        *   For information and communication services, if difficult to get consent normally due to economic/technical reasons, or for service charge payment.
    *   **Special Consent for Sensitive/Unique ID:** Requires **separate consent** (unless laws specifically require or permit processing without it). Processing resident registration numbers is highly restricted to specific legal requirements or imminent danger situations.
    *   **Children Under 14:** Consent of a legal representative is required.
4.  **Identify if Personal Information is Provided to a Third Party:**
    *   **Generally, separate consent is required** to provide personal information to a third party.
    *   **Checklist for Third-Party Provision (to be disclosed):**
        1.  Recipient of personal information.
        2.  Purpose of recipient's use.
        3.  Specific items of personal information provided.
        4.  Recipient's retention and use period.
        5.  The data subject's right to deny consent and any disadvantages.
    *   **Exception (consent NOT needed for third-party provision):** If provided within the scope of original collection purposes under certain legal conditions (similar to collection/use exceptions above).

## 6. Personal Information Protection Management Levels

Public institutions undergo a "Diagnosis of Personal Information Protection Management Levels" to continuously improve their protection standards.

+ Preview  for practical  business
A hacker who infiltrated  into an accommodation  app last year was found to have leaked personal
information  of 2.9 million people from eight other companies  during the same period. The leaked personal
information  included  website ID as well as name, date of birth, e-mail, mobile phone number, address,
passport  number, etc. The information  about 3,239,000  cases of accommodation  reservation  and 178,625
members,  as well as personal  information  about 971,877  members  (excluding  duplicative  cases) were found
to have been leaked from several companies.  In addition,  4817 menacing  and obscene  texts were sent by
abusing  the leaked accommodation  details.
The Korea Communications  Commission  found that the act amounts  to a “severe act of violation”  and
imposed  the penalty, as it violates  a number  of personal  information  protection  measures  such as access
control, access record preservation,  encryption,  and expiration  date set forth in the “Act on Promotion  of
Information  and Communication.  Network  Utilization  and Information  Protection,  Etc.” (the "Network  Act’).
The following  are examples  of personal  information  leaks in domestic  companies.
