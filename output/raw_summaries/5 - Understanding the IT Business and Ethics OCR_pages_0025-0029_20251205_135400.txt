## **1. The Expanding Role of IT in Business Value**

Information Technology (IT) is fundamental for modern businesses, driving efficiency, creating new values, and enabling global expansion.

*   **Boosting Production Efficiency & Sales:**
    *   IT allows for continuous adjustments to inventory levels based on real-time customer purchasing data.
    *   **Example:** Wal-Mart's **RetailLink system** provides suppliers direct access to sales data, improving inventory management, maximizing sales, and creating a significant competitive advantage.
*   **Creating New Business Values:**
    *   IT enables the formation of entirely new business models and value propositions.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Apple's iTunes Store:** Revolutionized music distribution from physical to digital, becoming a major growth driver for the company.
        *   **E-commerce:** Created virtual online markets, leading to new concepts like open markets and social commerce, changing traditional commerce.
*   **Expanding Global Business:**
    *   IT facilitates global cooperative work environments, allowing companies to explore new international markets.
    *   It challenges traditional views on the costs, labor, and time required for global expansion.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Videoconferencing systems:** Enhance decision-making speed and efficiency across dispersed teams.
        *   **Intranet systems:** Enable instant information exchange globally, overcoming time and space constraints, giving competitive advantages to international businesses.

## **2. Managing IT Business: The PDCA Cycle**

IT business management uses a cyclical process, the **PDCA cycle** (Plan, Do, Check, Act), to ensure IT initiatives are aligned with business goals and continuously improved.

*   **Plan (P):**
    *   Identify opportunities and issues related to IT business.
    *   Set clear goals and define the scope for IT initiatives.
    *   Establish an IT business plan that strategically links IT with overall business objectives.
*   **Do (D):**
    *   Design and implement the IT business solution or project.
    *   Collect operational data generated by the implemented IT solution.
*   **Check (C):**
    *   Analyze the results and outcomes of the IT business operations.
    *   Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for both business and IT.
    *   Verify the correlation and impact of IT performance on business results.
*   **Action (A):**
    *   Identify necessary improvements or adjustments based on the analysis from the "Check" phase.
    *   Modify the IT solution or processes to better support the business.
    *   The cycle then repeats, returning to the "Planning" phase for continuous refinement and renewal.

### **2.1 IT Business Management and Control Structure**

*   **Purpose:** To ensure IT services and infrastructure effectively support business processes to achieve desired IT business outcomes.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **IT Service & Infrastructure Support:** Provide operational support.
    2.  **Business Process:** The core activities that utilize IT.
    3.  **Performance Metrics:**
        *   **IT Service Quality (IT QoS):** Measures the quality of IT operational support.
        *   **Business Performance Results:** Measures the overall performance of the organization.
        *   These combine to form **IT-business performance metrics**.
    4.  **IT Business Management:** Analyzes these metrics and IT QoS to make informed decisions, adjustments, and investments in IT service and infrastructure, ensuring target performance levels are met.

## **3. The IT Business Value Chain**

The value chain model is a critical management theory for analyzing business activities and understanding a company's competitive advantage. It breaks down an enterprise into **key (primary) activities** and **support activities**.

### **3.1 Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains**

The structure of the value chain differs significantly based on the business model:

*   **Traditional Manufacturing Company Value Chain:**
    *   **Key Activities:** Warehousing, operation (production), shipment, marketing & sales, customer service.
    *   **Support Activities:** Corporate infrastructure, HR management, technology development, purchasing activities.
*   **E-commerce Company Value Chain:** (Focused on digital and electronic processes for efficiency)
    *   **Key Activities:** Procurement, zero-inventory production, third-party logistics, network sales, online services.
    *   **Support Activities:** Integrated information platform and network infrastructure, Internet recruitment, online management of suppliers.

### **3.2 The Evolving Role of IT in the Value Chain**

The perception of IT's role in the value chain has changed dramatically:

*   **Past View (Pre-mid-2000s):** IT was largely considered a "back-office support activity," separate from a company's main operations.
*   **Current View (Post-2000s, especially Post-2010):**
    *   **Company-Wide IT Integration:** IT is now integrated into *all* key and support activities across the entire company. It is a critical factor in every aspect of primary operations.
        *   **Example:** A hypermarket cannot operate competitively without IT to manage inventory, display products, and collect customer data in real-time. This highlights a fundamental **convergence** of the value chain model with IT.
    *   **IT-Specialized Companies:** For businesses whose core model is e-business or Internet-based (e.g., Amazon.com, Interpark), IT is inseparable from both their key and support activities. Their entire value chain is inherently IT-driven.
    *   **Expansion of the Value Chain Model:** This pervasive integration means our understanding of the traditional value chain must expand.
        *   IT integration drives significant **structural changes** within organizations (e.g., eliminating unnecessary decision-making steps via intranet systems, fostering more horizontal organizations by distributing information widely).
        *   The utilization of IT is now seen as having a decisive impact on an entire organization's structure and competitive advantages, representing a **new concept of the value chain model**.

## **4. Recent Trends & Major Issues: IT Business Strategy**

Developing an effective IT business strategy is crucial for companies to achieve their missions and objectives within complex internal and external environments.

*   **Strategic Importance:** Setting the right strategy is particularly critical for the modern IT business, which involves deep integration of IT with business processes.
*   **Key Areas of Focus:** As the domain of IT business expands, there is growing interest in:
    *   Methods for establishing robust IT business strategies.
    *   Techniques for analyzing the business environment (e.g., **SWOT analysis**) as a prerequisite for strategy formulation.
*   **Future Learning:** This topic involves exploring current and future models for IT business strategies, implementation methods, and various environmental analysis tools.

inventory  levels continuously  based on information  gleaned  from the customers’  purchasing  data. The inventory  data
are sent to a process  that analyzes  real-time  customer  purchasing  patterns.  This pursuit  of production  efficiency  can
maximize  sales and contribute  significantly  to the building  of competitive  advantages.
Wal-Mart  is a case in point. The company  recorded  sales of more than $28 per unit area of the store (which is more
than double that of other retailers  (sales of $12 per unit area on average)  through  the use of its RetailLink  system,
which allows suppliers  to access  Wal-Mart's  data warehouse  directly.
@ Creation  of new business  values
Since the dawn of the twenty-first  century,  we have been seeing ever more examples  of new business  values being
created through  the application  of IT resources.  Apple completely  changed  the offline music distribution  structure
with its iTunes music store. The new online music distribution  structure  has created  a new business  value, and this is
considered  by many to have been the greatest  driver of Apple’s  growth  as a company.
E-commerce  is also another  example  of a new business  value created by IT resources.  The virtual online market  that
emerged  through  IT is changing  the traditional  concept  of commerce,  spawning  new concepts  of commerce  such as
open markets  and social commerce.
@ Expansion  of global business
Many companies  today are seeking new markets  and global businesses  to develop  for the sake of their survival
and prosperity.  The global cooperative  working  environment  enabled by IT resources  has presented  possibilities  for
exploring  new markets  to companies  that otherwise  would have kept their focus on local markets  only. The global
cooperative  working  environment  has challenged  traditional  ideas about the costs, labor, and time needed for
developing  global businesses.
For example,  the establishment  of videoconferencing  systems  has improved  decision-making  speed and efficiency
in the rapidly changing  business  environment,  while the ability to exchange  information  through Intranet  systems
without  the constraints  of time and space has given huge competitive  advantages  to global businesses.
C) Management  activities  and structure  for IT business
The IT business's cyclical management  activities  follow the traditional  PDCA management  cycle of planning,
execution,  checking,  and corrective  action. The Planning  (P) phase identifies  opportunities  and issues, sets the goals
and scope for IT business,  and establishes  an IT business  plan for linking business  with IT.
In the Do (D) phase, the IT business  is designed  and implemented  and the business  operations  data are collected.  In
theC (Check)  phase, the results of IT business  operations  are analyzed,  the business  and IT performance  indicators
are monitored,  and business  & IT correlation  verification  is carried out.
In the Action (A) phase, the improvements  needed are identified  and IT adjustments/modifications  are made to
support  the IT business,  after which the Planning  (P) phase begins all over again, completing  and continuing  the cycle
of repeat and renewal  ad infinitum.

[Fig.8] The cyclical  management  of IT business
The cyclical management  structure  of IT business  is shown in [Fig, 8]. The IT service and  IT infra provide  operational
support  aimed at enablinga  business  (process)  toachieve  results in its IT business.
In IT business  management,  new IT business  performance  indicators  are derived from the service quality of the IT
operational  support  service (IT QoS) and the business  performance  results of the organization.  These indicators  are
then sent to the IT division.  The IT business  management  provides  support  for the making  and adjusting  of decisions,
and investments,  to the IT service and  IT infra,thus  ensuring  that the target levels for the performance  indicators  can
be met.
