    *   Evolving from single-operator services to common platforms where multiple providers participate.
    *   Shift from **closed platforms** (proprietary) to **open platforms**.
    *   Trend: Using shared common platforms instead of building individual ones.
    *   *Examples:* Apple App Store, Google Play, Facebook, Kakao.
*   **Network (N):**
    *   The "smart revolution" (smartphones, tablets, smart TVs) significantly increases network traffic.
    *   Next-generation services (smart homes, smart cars) generate large volumes of diverse traffic.
    *   IoT devices and sensors in the hyper-connected society produce massive data traffic.
    *   *Examples:* SK Telecom, KT, LG U+.
*   **Device (D):**
    *   Wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches, smart glasses) lead to fierce competition and collaboration among manufacturers.
    *   The number of smartphones and tablet PCs connecting to smart devices is growing.
    *   *Examples:* Smartphones, Tablets, PCs, McIntosh.
*   **Security (S):**
    *   Increasing sophistication of cyber threats (e.g., cyber terrorism, hacktivism) leads to more damage, especially to national infrastructure.
    *   Response strategy shifts from post-attack investigation to **early prevention** and **real-time resolution**.
    *   *Examples:* DDoS response, Attack detection, PIMS (Personal Information Management System), ISMS (Information Security Management System).

### 4. IT Resources and Management Activities

#### A) Concept of IT Resources

**IT Resources** include the people, processes, software, and hardware essential for running an IT business.

*   **Components of IT Resources:**
    *   **IT Support Systems:** Systems that support or manage IT businesses.
        *   *Examples:* **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning), **SCM** (Supply Chain Management), **PLM** (Product Lifecycle Management).
    *   **IT Management Systems:** Systems for managing IT services.
        *   *Example:* **ITSM** (Information Technology Service Management).
*   **Nature:** IT resources continuously evolve to maximize IT business results, adapting to changing technologies and times.
*   **IT Resource Management System:** Manages the entire lifecycle of IT resources (planning, development, application, operation, management, disposal). It tracks resource specifications and the business performance gains achieved by using them.

#### B) Role of IT Resources

IT resources provide three main benefits to an IT business:

1.  **Improved Production Efficiency:**
    *   Companies use IT to monitor customer patterns and manage inventory in real-time.
    *   *Example:* Wal-Mart's RetailLink system allows suppliers direct access to sales data, maximizing sales and competitive advantage.
2.  **Creation of New Business Values:**
    *   IT applications create entirely new business models and markets.
    *   *Examples:* Apple's iTunes transformed music distribution; E-commerce created online markets, open markets, and social commerce.
3.  **Expansion of Global Business:**
    *   IT resources enable global cooperative work, opening new markets and reducing costs, labor, and time for international expansion.
    *   *Examples:* Videoconferencing improves decision-making speed; Intranet systems facilitate information exchange across borders.

#### C) Management Activities and Structure for IT Business

IT business management follows a cyclical process:

**1. Cyclical Management Activities (PDCA Cycle):**

*   **P - Planning:**
    *   Identify opportunities and issues.
    *   Set IT business goals and scope.
    *   Create an IT business plan linking business objectives with IT.
*   **D - Do (Execution):**
    *   Design and implement the IT business solution.
    *   Collect operational data.
*   **C - Check:**
    *   Analyze IT business operational results.
    *   Monitor business and IT performance indicators.
    *   Verify the correlation between business and IT performance.
*   **A - Action (Corrective Action):**
    *   Identify necessary improvements.
    *   Adjust or modify IT solutions to better support the business.
    *   Repeat the cycle, returning to the Planning phase.

**2. Management and Control Structure:**

*   **Operational Support:** IT service and IT infrastructure provide support to enable business processes to achieve IT business results.
*   **Performance Metrics:** New IT business performance indicators are derived from:
    *   **IT QoS** (IT operational support service quality)
    *   Organizational business performance results.
*   **Decision Support:** These indicators are sent to the IT division. IT business management then supports decisions, adjustments, and investments in IT service and infrastructure to ensure target performance levels are met.
