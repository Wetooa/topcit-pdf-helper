2.  **Use of HTTP URI:** Proposes URIs accessible via HTTP protocol to enhance data access.
3.  **Use of RDF:** Uses data structured in a **triple model** (like RDF) for formalized representation and linking.
4.  **Assignment of Linked Information:** Makes linking existing Web data easier by assigning specific link information.

**Usefulness of Linked Data:**

*   **Reusable Data:** Data can be used via URI even if it's not one's own.
*   **Reduced Data Redundancy:** Helps identify and eliminate duplicate data.
*   **Maximize Interoperability & Consolidate Data Value:** Acts as a semantic web standard, can be queried like a database, enables "mash-ups" using data.
*   **Network Effects:** Data expansion through linking leads to network effects and acceleration.

### III. Open Data

**Open data** is data that anyone can freely use, reuse, and redistribute, provided it meets specific conditions.

**Conditions for Open Data:**

1.  **Availability and Access:**
    *   Must be downloadable over the Internet.
    *   Original data can be transformed, and new works produced, at reasonable cost.
    *   Provided in a convenient, modifiable format.
2.  **Reuse and Redistribution:**
    *   Data must be reusable and redistributable, including combinations with other datasets.
3.  **Universal Participation:**
    *   Everyone must be able to use, reuse, and redistribute the data.
    *   No restrictions on commercial/non-commercial use or specific purposes (e.g., education).

@ 3D Printing
A 3D printing  is a way of printing  3-dimensional  objects  using 3D data. The 3D data that is used as input is generated
from  a digital drawing, It is also known as additive  manufacturing,  since it builds three-dimensional  structures  by
stacking  layers of materials  that could be in powder,  liquid, or solid (threads,  wires, pellets)  state.
The reason why manufacturers  are paying attention  to 3D printing is that 3D printing is suitable  for customized
production  of small batches  of diverse range of products.  3D printing  improves  the manufacturing  environment
to satisfy consumers’  diverse needs, making it easy to customize  the product  quickly and easily to the needs of
consumers,  and providing  a one-person  manufacturing  environment  where consumers  can make their own products
In addition,  as the principal  of product  manufacturing  becomes  diverse  and the share of the manufacturing/
distribution  businesses  generated  by individuals  and small manufacturers  increases,  the reproce...
