## Learning Guide: Network Protocols (SCTP & Application Layer)

### 1. Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

SCTP is a transport layer protocol that offers features beyond TCP and UDP, especially useful for telephony applications and multi-homed hosts.

#### 1.1 Core SCTP Features

*   **Message Reassembly:** Fragments of a user message, divided for transmission, are reassembled by SCTP back into the original user message at the receiving end.
*   **Acknowledgment (ACK) & Congestion Avoidance:**
    *   SCTP assigns a **Transmission Sequence Number (TSN)** to each data chunk, regardless of its stream.
    *   The receiver acknowledges (ACKs) all received TSNs to ensure reliable transmission.
    *   If an ACK is not received within a set time, the packet is retransmitted using a congestion avoidance procedure, similar to TCP.
*   **Chunk Bundling:**
    *   SCTP can combine multiple user data chunks or SCTP control information chunks into a single SCTP packet for efficient transmission.
*   **Packet Validation:**
    *   SCTP packets include a **Verification Tag (VT)** and a 32-bit checksum (CRC32c) in their common header.
    *   The VT is unique to each "association" (connection) and prevents misdelivered packets. Packets with incorrect VTs are discarded.
    *   The checksum prevents data corruption during network transmission.
*   **Path Management:**
    *   Allows manipulation of the destination IP address and SCTP port number.
    *   A **primary path** is established during connection setup.
    *   If the primary path fails, an alternative path (possible with multi-homing, where an endpoint has multiple network interfaces) can be designated.
    *   Path management works alongside packet verification.

#### 1.2 SCTP Packet Structure

SCTP packets consist of a **general header** followed by a set of **chunks**.

*   **General Header:**
    *   Defines the endpoint of the association, ensures the packet belongs to a specific association, and maintains data integrity.
    *   **Components (Table 69):**
        *   **Source/Destination Port No.:** Identifies the application process, similar to TCP/UDP.
        *   **Verification Tag (VT):** Unique identifier for the association, present in all packets.
        *   **Checksum:** A 32-bit CRC-32 checksum (more robust than the 16-bit checksums in UDP, TCP, IP).
*   **Chunks:**
    *   Carry control information or user data.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Control Chunks:** Delivered before data chunks.
        *   **Data Chunks:** Carry user data.
    *   **Common Fields:** Each chunk has Type, Flag, and Length fields.
        *   **Type Field:** Indicates the specific chunk type.
        *   **Flag Field:** Defines special flags for chunk processing.
    *   **Major Chunk Types (Table 70):**
        *   0: Payload data
        *   1: INIT (Initiate an association)
        *   2: INIT ACK (Acknowledge initiation)
        *   3: SACK (Selective ACK)
        *   4: HEARTBEAT (Check path liveness)
        *   5: HEARTBEAT ACK
        *   6: Abort (Terminate an association abnormally)
        *   7: SHUTDOWN (Initiate graceful association termination)
        *   8: SHUTDOWN ACK
        *   9: ERROR
        *   10: COOKIE ECHO (Exchange security cookies)
        *   11: COOKIE ACK

### 2. Introduction to Application Layer Protocols

The application layer is the top layer in the network model, providing services directly to user applications.

#### 2.1 The Mobile Era & Protocol Importance

*   Since the mid-2000s, mobile platforms (Android, iOS) have driven a rapid shift to the mobile era.
*   Applications use either standard (e.g., SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP) or custom (e.g., KakaoTalk, Line, Facebook) application layer protocols.
*   Understanding these protocols is crucial for developing user-friendly applications.

#### 2.2 Learning Objectives (Summarized)

*   Understand, design, and use application layer protocols.
*   Understand and use **HTTP** for web client-server data exchange.
*   Understand and use **FTP** for client-server file exchange, including using open-source libraries.
*   Understand and develop web applications using **JSP-based server programming** and **client programming** (HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, etc.).

#### 2.3 Key Application Layer Terminology

*   **Application Layer Protocol:** Rules and procedures for applications to communicate over a network.
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Protocol for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It's the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
    *   **GET method:** Used to request data from a specified resource (e.g., loading a webpage).
    *   **POST method:** Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource (e.g., submitting a form).
*   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Protocol for transferring files between a client and a server.
    *   **Control connection:** Used for commands (e.g., login, directory listings).
    *   **Data connection:** Used for the actual file transfer.
    *   **General transport mode:** Active mode, where the client opens a port and tells the server to connect to it for data transfer.
    *   **Passive transport mode:** Passive mode, where the server opens a port and tells the client to connect to it for data transfer (common for clients behind firewalls).
*   **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** A technology that helps developers create dynamic, platform-independent web applications.
*   **HTML, JavaScript, AJAX:** Core technologies for web client-side development.

### 3. Application Layer Protocol Operation

#### 3.1 End-to-End Principle

*   Application layer protocols operate **end-to-end** between the client and server.
*   Intermediate network devices (like routers) between the endpoints do not affect their operation, similar to transport layer protocols (e.g., TCP).
*   Using internationally recognized standard protocols ensures compatibility across various applications and systems.

#### 3.2 Web Usage Scenario (HTTP Example)

*   **Scenario:** A user logs into a web server (`my.server.com`) and downloads a file (`my.pdf`).
*   This involves an application layer program (web browser) connecting to a web server program (`httpd`) via a **TCP connection**.
*   The web browser uses **HTTP/1.1** to communicate with the web server. It fetches content and displays it in a user-friendly format.

#### 3.3 HTTP/1.1 Protocol

*   HTTP/1.1 is a **text-based application layer protocol**.
*   Text data formatted according to HTTP/1.1 rules is delivered to the other application layer program via the transport layer.

#### 3.4 Role of Socket Programming

*   Application layer programs use **socket programming** to send and receive user data through the transport layer.
*   This is a fundamental technique for implementing application layer protocols, but its details are beyond the scope of this guide.

technique  is provided  to resolve it. Each fragment  that has been divided and transmitted  is reassembled  in the SCTP
layer to become  one user message.
@ Acknowledgment  and congestion  avoidance
SCTP transmits  a data chunk by assigning  a TSN to it, regardless  of the stream.  The receiving  side separately  secures
the transmission  reliability  from the sequenced  stream transmission  by acknowledging  (ACK) all the received  TSNs.
Acknowledgment  and congestion  control  functions  are related  to packet retransmission  if an acknowledgment  is not
received  within a given time. Packet retransmission  is performed  according  to a congestion  avoidance  procedure,
similar  to TCP congestion  control.
© Chunk bundling
A chunk with multiple  user data or SCTP control information  may follow an SCTP packet's  common  header,  An SCTP
user can request  to bundle multiple user messages  in a single SCTP packet. The SCTP chunk bundling  function is
responsible  for assembling  multiple  chunks  into one SCTP packet  and decomposing  it.
© Packet  validation
The SCTP common  header  has a verification  tag (VT) and a 32-bit checksum  field. The VT is a value selected  at
each endpoint  when setting  up the association. During  the set association,  SCTP packets  must be transmitted  using
the same VT, and if an SCTP packet with a wrong VT is received,  it is discarded.  Moreover, generating  a CRC32c
checksum  and transmitting  the SCTP packet  prevents  data corruption  in the network.
@ Path management
The transmitting  SCTP user can use the path management  function  to manipulate  the transport  address,  SCTP port
number,  and IP address,  used in the SCTP packet  destination. When the association  is established,  the primary  path
of each SCTP endpoint  is defined and used to transmit  and receive SCTP packets. However,  if there is a problem
with the current path, and available  transmission address  among the addresses,  defined by multi-homing, can be
designated  as an alternative  path. The path management  and the packet  verification  that uses the VT and checksum
are performed  simultaneously.
SCTP packets  have a general  header  and set of blocks called chunks.  There are two types of chunks: control chunks
and data chunks.  Control  chunks  are delivered  before data chunks.
The general header  defines the endpoint  of each association  of the packet, guarantees  a packet belonging  to a
specific  association,  and preserves  the integrity  of the contents  of the packet, including  the header  itself

chunks. The information  field indicates the type of the chunk, and the Type field is defined up to 256 bytes of the
chunk, but only some are defined,  and the rest are reserved  for future use. The Flag field defines special flags that
may require special chunks.
In some chunk types, the data chunk is identified  as the control  chunk. <Table  70> shows major chunk types.

>p> Recent  trends and issues
With the advent  of mobile platforms,  such as Android and iOS, since the mid-2000s,  society  has rapidly
transformed  into the mobile era, as applications  useful for work and personal  leisure have emerged.  Some
programs  use standard  application  layer protocols,  such as SMTP, POP3, IMAP. and FTP. and some others,
like SNS, use their own application  layer protocols,  such as KakaoTalk,  Line, and Facebook.  Developers  can
only develop  user-friendly  application  programs  when they have a good understanding  of the concept  and
operation  method  of the application  layer protocol  operating  on the transport  layer.
