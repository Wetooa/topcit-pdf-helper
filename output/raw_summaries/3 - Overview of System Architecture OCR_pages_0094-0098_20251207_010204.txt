## Learning Guide: System Architecture & Data Management

### 1. RAID Configurations

**RAID** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) provides data redundancy and/or improved performance.

#### 1.1 RAID-6 (Stripe set with dual distributed parity)
*   **Concept:** Similar to RAID-5, but stores **two independent parity blocks** across different drives.
*   **Minimum Drives:** 4
*   **Benefit:** Enhanced data durability and safety. Can withstand **two drive failures** without data loss.
*   **Why use it?** Solves the risk of data loss in RAID-5 if a second drive fails during a long rebuild process.
*   **Mechanism:** Data is striped (distributed) across drives, with two dedicated parity blocks for redundancy.

#### 1.2 RAID-10 (Striping & Mirroring)
*   **Concept:** A combination of RAID-0 (striping for speed) and RAID-1 (mirroring for redundancy).
*   **Minimum Drives:** 4
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Improved I/O Speed:** From RAID-0.
    *   **High Data Stability/Redundancy:** From RAID-1.
    *   Addresses performance issues of RAID-1 and stability issues of RAID-0.
*   **Drawback:** High cost due to 50% storage overhead (mirrored drives).
*   **Configurations:**
    *   **RAID 1+0 (RAID-10):** Drives are first mirrored (RAID-1 sets), then these mirrored sets are striped together (RAID-0). This is generally preferred for better stability.
    *   **RAID 0+1:** Drives are first striped (RAID-0 sets), then these striped sets are mirrored (RAID-1).

### 2. Backup Storage Solutions

#### 2.1 Linear Tape-Open (LTO)
*   **Concept:** An open-standard tape drive technology.
*   **Purpose:** High-speed data processing and large-capacity data storage (tape backups).
*   **Terminology:** Also referred to as tape backup machines, LTO libraries, etc.
*   **Evolution:** LTO generations have significantly increased speed and capacity over time (e.g., LTO-1: 100 GB / 20 MB/s in 2000; LTO-8: 12.8 TB / 427 MB/s today; LTO-10 (expected): 48 TB / 1100 MB/s).

#### 2.2 Virtual Tape Library (VTL)
*   **Concept:** A backup solution that emulates disk storage as a virtual tape device.
*   **Purpose:** Overcomes limitations of physical tape devices (performance, scalability, recovery time).
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies backup processes and enables high-speed backups through tape virtualization, using disk arrays to simulate tape libraries.

### 3. Graphic Compression Technology

Compression reduces file size, essential for multimedia data.

#### 3.1 Types of Compression

*   **Lossless Compression (Reversible Compression):**
    *   **Definition:** Compresses data in a way that allows perfect reconstruction of the original data upon decompression. **No information is lost.**
    *   **Characteristic:** Lower compression rates compared to lossy compression.
*   **Lossy Compression (Irreversible Compression):**
    *   **Definition:** Achieves higher compression rates by **permanently discarding some data** that is deemed redundant or less important. The decompressed data is an approximation of the original.
    *   **Characteristic:** Higher compression rates.

#### 3.2 Lossless Compression Methods
*   **Run-length Encoding (RLE):** Represents consecutive identical symbols as the symbol itself and a count of its repetitions (e.g., "AAAAB" becomes "A4B1").
*   **Dictionary Coding:** Builds a dictionary of frequently occurring character strings. When a string is found, it's replaced by a shorter code or index from the dictionary.
*   **Huffman Coding:** Assigns shorter binary codes to frequently occurring symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols.
*   **Arithmetic Coding:** Represents an entire message as a fraction within the interval [0,1], then encodes that fraction in binary.

#### 3.3 Lossy Compression Methods
*   **Prediction Coding:** Used for analog signals. Instead of quantizing (digitizing) samples directly, it quantizes the *difference* between samples. These difference values are smaller, requiring fewer bits.
*   **Transform Coding:** Transforms a signal from one domain (e.g., time/space) to another (e.g., frequency). This allows more efficient compression in the new domain, often by discarding less perceptually important frequency components.

### 4. Multimedia Data

Multimedia data includes text, image, video, and audio.

#### 4.1 Text Data
*   **Forms:** Plain text, non-linear hypertext.
*   **Standard:** Unicode is used for expressing symbols.
*   **Compression:** Typically uses **lossless compression**.

#### 4.2 Image Data (Still Image)
*   **Examples:** Photos, fax pages, video frames.
*   **JPEG Compression Process:**
    1.  **Transformation:** Image data (often in 8x8 blocks) is transformed using a **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**. This converts spatial information into frequency information.
    2.  **Quantization:** The real numbers from the DCT are converted to integers, and some values (less perceptually significant frequencies) are set to zero. **This is the main lossy step.**
    3.  **Coding:** Data is arranged in a zigzag pattern, then **lossless compression** methods like Run-length Encoding and Arithmetic Coding are applied for further reduction.
*   **Decompression:** Uses inverse processes (inverse DCT).

#### 4.3 Video Data
*   **Composition:** Series of individual image frames. Requires high transmission rates.
*   **Compression Methods:**
    *   **Spatial Compression:** Compresses *each individual frame* as a standalone image (like JPEG).
    *   **Temporal Compression:** Removes redundancy *between frames*. It categorizes frames:
        *   **I-frames (Intra-coded):** Independent, full image frames.
        *   **P-frames (Predictive):** Reference previous I- or P-frames to encode only changes.
        *   **B-frames (Bi-directional):** Reference both previous and future I- or P-frames for even greater efficiency.

#### 4.4 Audio Data
*   **Digitization:** Analog audio signals are converted to digital using an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**.
*   **ADC Processes:**
    1.  **Sampling:** Taking discrete measurements of the analog signal at regular intervals.
    2.  **Quantization:** Assigning a digital value to each sampled measurement.

### 5. Video Compression Standards (MPEG)

**MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)** is an international standardization organization for multimedia.

| Standard Type       | Key Features                                       | Common Applications                  |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **MPEG-1**          | Audio and video compression/decompression          | MP3, Video CD                        |
| **MPEG-2**          | Compression/decompression for DTV broadcasting     | Digital TV, DVD                      |
| **MPEG-4**          | Mobile phone video compression/decompression       | IMT2000, Internet broadcasting       |
| **AVC/H.264**       | Twice the compression rate compared to MPEG-2      | HDTV, mobile phone video             |
| **MPEG-V**          | VR media presentation and control                  | 4D movies, VR                        |
| **MPEG-DASH**       | Internet-based video streaming (adaptive)          | Internet image streaming             |
| **HEVC/H.265**      | Twice the compression rate compared to AVC         | UHDTV, Smart TV                      |
| **3D Audio**        | Adds dimensions to existing surround audio         | UHDTV, Smart TV                      |

#### 5.1 AVC (Advanced Video Coding) & HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)
*   **AVC (H.264 / MPEG4 Part10/AVC):** A video compression technology jointly developed by ITU-T (called H.264) and ISO (called MPEG4 Part10/AVC). They refer to the same standard.
*   **HEVC (H.265 / ISO/IEC 23008-2):** The successor to AVC, offering significantly higher compression efficiency, roughly double that of AVC.

@ RAID-6  (Stripe set with dual distributed  parity)
RAID-6 is similar to RAID-5, except that while RAID-5 stores one parity, RAID-6  redundantly  stores a parity in two
drives. The configuration  is more durable  than RAID-5  and can store data safely. In a RAID-5  configuration,  the rebuild
time restores  data to the new drive when  a drive fails and is replaced. The rebuilding  takes a long time in a storage
system  with a large storage  capacity.  If another  drive fails during  this rebuilding  time, there is a possibility  of data loss.
Therefore,  RAID-6 is recommended.

© RAID-10(Striping  & Mirroring)
RAID-10  requires  at least four drives and is a combination  of RAID-O and RAID-1 to improve  |/O speed while
providing  data stability.  It eliminates  the concern  with stability,  which is an important  drawback  of RAID-O, and it
can significantly  improve  performance,  which is the biggest  drawback  of RAID-1. However,  its disadvantage  is that
the cost is high. RAID 1+0 configures  two drives in mirroring  first, then RAID-1 drives, configured  of two drives, are
configured  in RAID-0.  RAID 0+1 divides  the drives to be configured  in half, configures  them in RAID-O,  and reconfigures
Ys of the drives and the remaining  1/2 of the drives in RAID-1. The RAID-10  configuration  features  better stability  and
generally  uses RAID-10  more than RAID-O+1.

B) Backup  storage:  LTO and VTL
@ Linear  tape-open  (LTO)
LTO is a standard  open tape drive technology  that supports  high-speed  data processing  and  a large capacity.
Although  LTO refers to physical devices  and technology,  they are also used interchangeably.  It is also called the tape
backup machine,  tape media machine,  LTO machine,  LTO library, and LTO. LTO-1, first released in 2000, provided  a
maximum  speed of 20 MB/s at an uncompressed  capacity  of 100 GB. The LTO-8 that is currently  available,  supports
the performance  of a maximum  speed of 427MB/s  based on an uncompressed  capacity  of 12.8TB. The LTO-10 is
expected  to provide  a maximum  speed of 1100MB/s  at an uncompressed  capacity  of 48TB.
@ Virtual tape library (VTL)
VTL is a backup solution  that emulates  disk storage and makes it into a virtual tape device to compensate  for
problems  such as limited performance,  scalability,  and the recovery  time of existing  tape backup devices. Backup is
simplified,  and high-speed  backup  is enabled  through  tape virtualization.

04 Graphic  Compression  Technology
A) Graphic  compression  type
Video data compression,  which accounts  for most of the traffic in a multimedia  network,  can be divided  into lossless
compression  (reversible  compression)  and lossy compression  (irreversible  compression).  Lossless  compression  is also
called reversible  compression.It  refers to a method  of restoring  a compressed  image without  information  loss from the
original data while decompressing.  It is characterized  by a lower compression  rate than lossy compression.
Lossy compression  is also called irreversible  compression.It  refers to a compression  method when the compressed
data is restored,  but it does not match  the original  data before the compression  because  some data is lost.

@ Lossless  compression
Since the compression  and decompression  algorithms  are exactly  the opposite  of each other, the compression
method preserves  the original data’s integrity,  and no part of the data is lost during processing.  Leading  lossless
compression  methods  include run-length  decoding,  dictionary  decoding,  Huffman  coding, dictionary  coding, and
arithmetic  coding.
