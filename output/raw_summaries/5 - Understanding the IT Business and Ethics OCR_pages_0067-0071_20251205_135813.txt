# Learning Guide: Business Processes and IT Management

## 1. Business Processes: The Foundation of an Enterprise

*   **Enterprise Definition:** A formal organization focused on making profits by selling goods or services for more than their production costs.
*   **Enterprise as Functions:** Can be seen as a collection of interconnected business activities (functions) governed by **business rules** to achieve specific objectives.
    *   **Business Rules:** Dictate *when, how, in what order, and which* actions apply. They heavily influence an organization's management, performance, and value creation.
*   **Business Process Definition:** The documented method and organization of work within an enterprise.

### Common Business Processes by Function:

| Function                      | Key Business Processes                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manufacturing & Production** | Product assembly, quality inspections, raw material list production, ordering & procurement management, production planning management, Bill of Materials (BOM) management.                                          |
| **Sales & Marketing**         | Customer identification, customer product management, product sales, distribution management.                                                                                                                         |
| **Finance/Accounting**        | Cost estimation, prepayment/borrowing management, issuance of bonds, settlement of payment, process payment, tax invoice issuance, production of financial statements, cost management.                                |
| **HR Management**             | Recruitment, appointment, tardiness & absenteeism management, employee welfare management, performance evaluation, wage management.                                                                                       |

### Example: An IT Business Service Process (Printer Repair)

This shows a typical service lifecycle:
1.  **Customer Problem:** A customer's printer isn't working.
2.  **Service Request:** Customer contacts the customer center for repair.
3.  **Personnel Assignment:** If an on-site visit is needed, the center assigns service personnel.
4.  **Visit Scheduling:** Personnel contacts the customer to understand symptoms and arrange a visit time.
5.  **Repair & Confirmation:** Personnel visits, diagnoses, repairs the printer, and gets the customer's signature as confirmation.
6.  **Billing & Payment:**
    *   For paid repairs, the customer is billed, creating revenue for the company.
    *   A tax invoice is issued and sent to the customer.
    *   The customer pays, and the payment is processed (crediting accounts receivable).
*   **Outcomes:** This process enables customer service and generates profits.
*   **Involved Departments:** Service, Accounting, Materials, and Revenue (Sales).
*   **Key Principle:** Business processes need continuous improvement and flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Waste and bottlenecks must be constantly identified and addressed.

## 2. Methods of Executing IT Business Processes

### A) IT Business Process Management (BPM)

*   **Overview:** A core technique for optimizing and automating business processes within IT.
    *   **Related Concepts:**
        *   **BAM (Business Activity Monitoring):** Used to identify and manage bottlenecks.
        *   **BRE (Business Rule Engine):** Manages and executes business rules and process flows.
*   **BPM Definition:** The consolidated management, optimization, and automation of the flow of people, information, resources, and tasks in IT business processes. It's vital for business performance and requires a logical, structured approach that can actively respond to changes.

#### BPM Design Stages:

1.  **Process Definition:** Define core processes, identify rules, analyze processes, and establish measurement methods.
2.  **Process Execution, Operation:** Run and manage processes according to guidelines, ensuring seamless connections (person-to-person, person-to-system, system-to-system).
3.  **Monitoring Control:** Track job completion times, performance quality, and execution progress in real-time. Maintain records of monitoring.
4.  **Process Improvement:** Identify and compare Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for process performance. Conduct simulations to find improvements, and continuously repeat the execution and improvement cycle.

### B) Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)

*   **Definition:** A technique to optimize IT business processes. It monitors processes in real-time to detect bottlenecks and identify risk factors early.
*   **Function:** Leverages extended **Business Intelligence (BI)** techniques for real-time analysis to monitor and manage process flow.

#### BAM Base Technologies:

*   **Business Intelligence (BI):** Analyzes key business process indicators (KPIs).
*   **Data Warehouse:** Collects and analyzes statistical data to identify risks in business processes.
*   **BPM (Business Process Management):** Analyzes business events and guides process improvements.
*   **System Infrastructure:** Manages the network and integrated system; used for collecting, analyzing, visualizing data, and processing events.

### C) Business Rule Engine (BRE)

*   **Definition:** A technique for effectively managing, automating, and optimizing processes by formalizing complex business rules and process flows.
*   **Need:** Essential due to the increasing volume and complexity of information in IT business processes. Rule-based management is needed for service improvements and cost savings.
*   **Benefits:** Helps enterprises proactively manage changes and reduce operating costs for business processes.

#### BRE Component Elements:

*   **Rule Manager:** Develops and manages business rules, handles the process lifecycle, and manages the rule repository.
*   **Rule Service:** Acts as a server for the rule engine, providing interfaces between processes, distributing rules, and offering rule services.
*   **Rule Monitoring:** Supports process improvement, rule performance tuning, analysis, and statistical functions.
*   **Rule Repository:** A storage location for all business rules.

## 3. IT Business Process Information Management

*   **Context:** As IT business processes become more complex and require rapid adaptation to changes, systematic management of the data they generate is increasingly important.
*   **Methods:** Data generated by IT business processes can be managed using **Information Life Cycle Management (ILM)** or **Information Resource Management (IRM)**.

### A) Information Life Cycle Management (ILM)

*   **Definition:** A series of processes for categorizing and managing storage media based on the changing value of data throughout its entire life cycle.
*   **Purpose:** To reduce data management costs and systematically manage data, especially as data volume grows and its value changes over time.

#### ILM Constituent Elements:

1.  **Management Policies Category:**
    *   **IT Governance:** Provides guidelines for data generation, storage, and disposal.
    *   **IT Compliance:** Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and policy standards.
    *   **Enterprise Data Management Policy:** Specific policies related to the organization's Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Data Architecture (DA) systems and data operations.
2.  **Technology Elements Category:**
    *   **1st Storage:** For high-utilization, high-value data; uses high-performance, expensive storage solutions.
    *   **2nd Storage:** For lower-utilization, lower-value data; uses low-performance, low-priced storage solutions.
    *   **Data Archiving:** Technology that periodically archives data and processes it automatically.
    *   **Backup:** Storing data separately using tape libraries or affordable disks, following a defined backup policy.

### B) Information Resource Management (IRM)

*   **Definition:** The efficient and integrated management of all IT resources.
*   **Purpose:** To prevent redundant investments in IT resources and increase the Return on Investment (ROI).
*   **Scope:** Manages a wide range of IT resources, including human resources, IT equipment, budgets, and IT outputs.

ESSENCE
B) Business  process
An enterprise  is a formal organization  whose objective  is the pursuit  of profits through  the sale of goods or services
at prices higher  than the costs required  to produce  them.
Furthermore,  an enterprise  can be viewed as a collection  of interrelated  business  functions  (or activities)  defined by
various business  rules with the aim of realizing  some objectives.  Here, the term “business  rules” refers to the rules
that determine  when, how, in what order, and which rules should be applied. Business  rules (ie. processes)  have a
significant  impact  on an organization's  management,  performance,  and value creation.
The step of describing  the method and the job of organizing  work in an enterprise  is called the “business  process”.
Examples  of common  business processes  by function  (such as manufacturing  and production,  sales and marketing,
finance,  and HR management)  are described  in the table below.
<Table 20> Relationships  between  the functions  and business  processes  of an enterprise
Functions  of an enterprise Business  Processes
| + Product  assembly + Ordering  and procurement  management
Manufacturing  and * Quality inspections * Production  planning management
Production
+ Raw material  list production + BOM management
+ Customer  identification + Product  sales
Sales and Marketing + Customer  product  management + Distribution  management
* Cost estimation  management + Prepayment/borrowing  management
+ Issuance  of bonds + Settlement  of payment
Finance/Accounting + Process payment + Tax invoice issuance
+ Production  of financial  statements + Cost management
+ Recruitment + Employee  welfare  management
HR Management + Appointment + Performance  evaluation
* ardiness  and absenteeism  management + Wage management
03 Examples  of the IT Business  Process
The figure below is a diagram  of the typical service process of a company  that sells multifunctional  printers.If  a
customer  encounters  a problem with the multifunctional  printer he/she has been using, he/she requests  a repair
service by contacting  the customer  center. The center assigns  a member  of the service personnel if a visit to the
customer's  site is deemed  to be warranted. The service personnel  assigned  to the task talks to the customer  to
determine  the symptoms  and schedule  the visit.

The service personnel  will then visit the customer  at the appointed  time to examine  the problem  with the printer and
repair it. The service  personnel  will request  the customer's  signature  as confirmation  of completion  of the repair work.
In the case of paid repairs, the customer  will be billed for the repairs,  which translates  into revenues  for the company.
When the sales amount  and service  fee are settled and  a sale is confirmed,  a tax invoice is issued and delivered  to
the customer.  Upon receipt  of the tax invoice,  the customer  proceeds  with the payment.
The money received and deposited  by the customer  is settled by crediting  the accounts  receivables  through the
deposit  process.  This series of processes  enables  the enterprise  to perform  two activities.  First, it can provide
customer  services  through service activities  and, second, it can generate  profits. The processes  involved in the
payment-based  service  fall under the following  job domains:  service,  accounting,  materials,  and revenue  (sales).
While some of these business  processes  are firmly cemented,  most of them have to be improved  and be able
to adapt flexibly to changes  in the business  environment.  An environment  must be created  wherein waste and
bottlenecks  can be constantly  identified  and jobs quickly  processed.
