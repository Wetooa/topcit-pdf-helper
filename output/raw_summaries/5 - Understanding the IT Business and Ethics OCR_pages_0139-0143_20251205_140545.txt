## IT ESSENTIALS: Online Services & Mobile Technologies

This guide covers key concepts in online social interaction, software integration, and mobile services.

### 1. Social Network Service (SNS)

**Definition:**
*   Online platform for people to maintain existing relationships or form new ones.
*   Began as early online communities (e.g., "The Well" in 1985).

**Main Functions:**
*   **Forming Relationships:** Set connections with others.
*   **Profile Management:** Register personal info (hometown, interests, occupation).
*   **Communication:** Chat, messages, email, video calls.
*   **Content Production:** Create and share photos, videos, texts.
*   **Network Utilization:** Share profiles and content with others.

**Scale:**
*   Global SNS sites have billions of monthly users (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp).

### 2. Open API (Open Application Programming Interface)

**Definition:**
*   A free, public API that allows anyone (users, developers) to access website functions.
*   Enables users to move beyond consuming services to developing and using their own.

**Characteristics:**
*   **Access Website Functions:** Allows external applications to interact with a website's features.
*   **New Service Design:** Multiple APIs can be combined to create novel services.
*   **Mashup Sites:** A key enabler for mashup sites (websites that combine data/functions from multiple sources, e.g., combining map data with real estate listings).
*   **User Empowerment:** Transforms users into potential service providers.

**Component Elements:**
*   **Open API Service:** The actual functionality provided (e.g., weather data, traffic info, maps).
*   **How to 'Open' an API:** Technologies used for communication (e.g., XML, SOAP on server-side; XML, JavaScript, AJAX on client-side).

#### REST (Representational State Transfer) API

**Definition:**
*   Currently the most widely used type of Open API.
*   A network-based architecture for web services, designed by Roy Fielding in 2000.
*   Based on Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), utilizing HTTP methods.

**Structure:**
*   **HTTP URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** Specifies the target resource (e.g., a user profile, a product).
*   **HTTP Method:** Specifies the action to be performed on that resource.

**Common REST API Methods:**
*   **POST:** Creates a new resource.
*   **GET:** Searches for and retrieves information about a resource.
*   **PUT:** Corrects/updates an existing resource.
*   **DELETE:** Removes a resource.

### 3. Mobile Services

The "Anytime, Anywhere, Any Device" nature of mobile technology drives mobile commerce, entertainment, communication, and location-based services.

#### A. Location Based Service (LBS)

**Definition:**
*   Services that merge location information with commerce, entertainment, and other applications.
*   Has grown exponentially with the smartphone market.

**Key Drivers:**

Category Description
What could be Open API Service  that an API provides  to users (weather,  traffic, public information,  map, etc.)
Server: XML, SOAP, Blooging  API
How to ‘open’ an API Ciient: XML, Javascript,  DOM, XML Http Request, AJAX, etc.
+ REST (Representational  State Transfer)  API
REST API is currently  the most widely used Open API.
REST API is a network-based  architecture  published  in 2000 by Roy Fielding,  one of HTTP's leading authors, to
properly  utilize the superiority  of the Web (HTTP). REST is a web service architecture  based on the Resource
Oriented  Architecture  (ROA) and it is composed  of HTTP URI + HTTP Method.  HTTP URI is used to specify  the target
resource,  and the designation  of actions  for that resource  utilizes the HTTP Method.
<Table  70> Examples  of REST API Method
Method Role
POST Generates  the relevant  resource.
GET Search  the relevant  resource  and extracts  information.
PUT Corrects  the relevant  resource.
DELETE Deletes  the relevant  resource.
B) Mobile service
@ Location  Based Service
Location-based  services  are growing  together  with the smartphone  market, which has seen exponential  growth
since 2010, and are evolving  into a broad category  of services  by merging  location information,  commerce,  and
entertainment.  Due to the mobile Big Bang, the availability  of location  detection  capable  devices greatly increased
and the location  determination  platform  became  open. This led to the rapid evolution  of location-based  services  (LBS)
In the case of location  detection  mechanism  used in smartphones,  location  detection  technologies  like base stations
Cell-ID, GPS, and Wi-Fi were combined  with motion sensor-based  precision  guess navigation.  Furthermore,  by
adopting  maps like Google Map and Apple Map, location-based  services  began to be used for many general purposes.
9 Mashup site -Websites  that use APIs for product  information,  map information,  etc. from Microsoft,  Google, Yahoo, Amazon,  and
others and combines  them with their own user interfaces  to come up with new services.
