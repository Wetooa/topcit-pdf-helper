## Operating Systems (OS) Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to Operating Systems (OS)

*   **What are Computers?**
    *   Electronic devices like desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablet PCs are all considered "computers."
    *   They all require an Operating System (OS) and major hardware components.
*   **Importance of an OS:**
    *   An OS is **indispensable software**. Without it, even the best hardware is useless.
    *   It's the **medium** that allows users to access the full performance of a computer.
    *   It **controls** all device operations, from power-on to power-off.
    *   It **commands hardware** (CPU, memory, storage) to perform tasks, allowing users to run programs and applications.
*   **Definition of OS:**
    *   A **system software** that efficiently manages a computer's limited hardware resources.
    *   It provides an **interface** for users and application programs to access these resources.
*   **Historical Context:**
    *   Early computers lacked an OS and ran only **single-purpose programs**.
    *   Developers had to manually implement every interface and resource allocation, making development slow and difficult.
*   **Main Purposes of OS:**
    *   **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex hardware by providing standardized interfaces (APIs) for applications.
        *   *API (Application Programming Interface):* A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
    *   **Virtualization:** Allows multiple applications and users to share computer resources, making a single physical computer appear as multiple virtual ones.
    *   **Management:** Maximizes computer resource performance while managing constraints, providing resources to applications efficiently.

### 2. Main Functions of an OS

The OS abstracts and virtualizes hardware to manage resources efficiently. Its main functions include:

*   **Process Management:**
    *   **What is a Process?** A running program. It's a system work unit that allocates, uses, and recovers resources (CPU, storage, files, I/O) to perform tasks.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Creating and disposing of user and system processes.
        *   Terminating and restarting processes.
        *   Providing techniques for process communication and synchronization.
        *   Preventing deadlocks (situations where processes are stuck waiting for each other).
*   **Main Memory Unit Management:**
    *   **What is Main Memory?** (Often called RAM) A high-speed storage where the CPU fetches commands and data. The CPU can only access data directly if it's in main memory.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Tracking and managing memory space usage.
        *   Deciding which process occupies memory space.
        *   Allocating and recovering memory space.
*   **File Management:**
    *   Abstracts various physical storage devices (magnetic tape, disks, flash memory) into **files**, which are logical storage units.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Creating and disposing of files.
        *   Creating and disposing of directories (folders).
        *   Providing basic file and directory management.
        *   Mapping files from auxiliary memory (like hard drives) for OS use.
        *   Storing files on non-volatile storage (data persists even when power is off).
*   **Input/Output (I/O) System Management:**
    *   Helps users easily use various input/output devices (mouse, keyboard, printer, speaker) without needing to know their specific characteristics.
*   **Auxiliary Memory Unit Management:**
    *   Manages large volumes of data stored on secondary storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs) as main memory capacity is limited.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Managing empty space on storage.
        *   Allocating storage space.
        *   Disk scheduling (optimizing how data is read/written to disks).
*   **Networking:**
    *   Integrates scattered computer resources into a distributed system (multiple processors/memory units communicating at high speed).
    *   **Purpose:** Improves calculation speed, shares data, and enhances reliability.
*   **Command-Interpreter System:**
    *   A system program that allows users to access main OS functions by entering commands (e.g., MS-DOS, UNIX shell).

### 3. Types of Main Operating Systems

| Type        | OS             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 4. Process and Thread

#### A) Understanding a Process

*   **Early vs. Modern Systems:**
    *   Early computers ran only one program at a time, monopolizing all resources.
    *   Modern systems run multiple programs **concurrently** (at the same time). The OS manages resources for stable concurrent operation.
*   **Process Definition:**
    *   A **running program**. In a concurrent, multi-process environment, it's a work unit in a time-sharing system.
*   **Process Status:** A process goes through different stages during its lifecycle:
    *   **Created:** Process is generated but not yet running by the OS.
    *   **Preparing (Ready):** Process is waiting for the CPU to be allocated so it can run.
    *   **Running:** Process has been allocated the CPU and is actively executing instructions.
    *   **Finished:** Process has completed its execution, and the CPU allocation is released.
    *   **Standby (Waiting/Blocked):** Process was running but is now waiting for an event to complete (e.g., an input/output operation).
*   **Process Control Block (PCB):**
    *   A data structure that stores all information necessary for the OS to manage a specific process.
    *   A unique PCB is created when a process starts and removed when it finishes.
    *   **Includes:** Process Identification Number (PIC), process status, program counter (next instruction to run), scheduling priority, registered information, main memory unit information.

#### B) Process Management Techniques

*   **Process Creation:**
    *   Processes can be created and removed dynamically and run in parallel.
    *   A running process can create new processes using the **`fork()` system call**.
    *   The creator is the **parent process**, and the new one is the **child process**.
    *   This forms a **tree structure** where a child can also become a parent.
*   **Process Termination:**
    *   When a process finishes its code, it requests the OS to delete it using the **`exit()` system call**.
    *   A parent process can use the **`wait()` system call** to receive data from its child process before the child terminates.
    *   The OS then **recollects all resources** allocated to the terminated process.

computer  operation
As of 2016, Korea’s computer  user rate was 85.7%, meaning  that more than 8 out of 10 people were
using computers.  During  the same period, the smartphone  user rate grew much faster than PCs, reaching
88.5%. With the rapid proliferation  of mobile devices,  the PC user rate is gradually  decreasing,  and the us of
laptopswhich  have gradually  replaced  desktops,  have also continued  to decline  after exceeding  30% for the
first time in 2014. Smartphones  and tablet PCs are increasingly  taking  over the place of computers.
Electronic  devices,  such as desktops,  laptops,  and smartphones,  are collectively  referred  to as “computers”
and they have things that are commonly  applied to them. They contain indispensable  software,  an
operating  system (OS), and major hardware.  Having  the best processor  and components  is useless  without
an OS. The OS is a medium  that delivers  close to 100% of the outstanding  performance  of a manufacturer's
computer  to users.
The elements,  such as the CPU, mainboard,  memory,  graphics  card, and storage  device, that make up a
computer  cannot  do anything  by themselves.  Users can get work done with a word processor  and can enjoy
playing  World of Warcraft,  only when the OS gives the commands  of what to do to each piece of hardware.
The operating  system, which is software,  is responsible  for the device operation  from start to finish. It is
the OS's role from the moment  it recognizes  the power supply, until it shuts off the power on command.
Without  an OS, the user must manually  turn the power on or off in an analog way, like the older products.
Commands  for device operation  are mechanical, and the device can only perform  one function  with an
input. In today’s  electronic  devices,  which have been mostly  converted  to operate  electronically,  the volume
and power buttons  remain manual.

01 Operating  System  (OS)
A) Overview  of OS
OS is a system software  that provides  a computer  resource  interface  to users or application programs  by efficiently
managing  the limited resources  of computer  hardware.
The first computers  were set to operate single-purpose  programs,  as they did not have an OS. The programs

ran slowly and were difficult  to develop  in this form, since the developer  needed to implement  every interface  for
accessing  the computer's  resources  and allocating  and recovering  resources.  OS implements  input, control,  memory,
operation,  and output functions  to provide services  in order to use computer  resources  efficiently.  In other words,
an OS controls  the computer's  resources  and implements  usage policies to allocate resources  to users through
scheduling,  It exchanges  data through  input/output  devices,  or outputs  exceptions  or errors. The purposes  of using
the operating  system  are as follows.
+ Abstraction:  Provides  standardized  API to application  programs  by abstracting  the complexity  of the computer's
hardware.
+ Virtualization:  Provides  a virtualization  function to enable application  programs  and users to share computer
resources,  and to use a single virtual computer  hardware.
+ Management:  Maximizes  computer  resource  performances  and provides  them to application  programs,  while
meeting  computer  resource  constraints.
B) Main functions  of OS
OS abstracts  and virtualizes  computer  hardware  to provide resources  to application  programs,  or to manage  them
efficiently.  Therefore,  OS can be understood  by the functions  of managing  main hardware  components.  The main
functions  of OS are described  as follows.
@ Process  management
In simple terms, a process is a running  program.  However,  it is actually more than just a program,  as a process  is a
system  work unit that allocates,  uses, and recovers  various  resources,  such as the CPU, storage  unit, files, and input/
output  units to perform  its tasks. An OS manages  processes  and performs  the following  tasks:
- Creating  and disposing  of user and system processes
- Terminating  and re-running  processes
- Providing  a technique  for process  communication  and synchronization
- Providing  techniques  to prevent  deadlock
@ Main memory  unit management
A hard disk (HDD) is the hardware  that most people think of when they consider  a storage unit. However,  the main
memory  is a different  type of storage. The main memory  is a depository  that allows the CPU to fetch commands
and data to use from the instructions,  The addresses  that the CPU uses to access data are only available  in the main
memory.  Even if the CPU intends  to retrieve  data in an HDD, it cannot read the data if it is not stored in the main
memory.  The main memory  must handle the following  management  function...
