## Learning Guide: Personal Information De-identification and Protection

This guide summarizes essential concepts, methods, and systems related to protecting personal information, focusing on de-identification and management systems.

---

### 1. De-identification of Personal Information

**Purpose:** To prevent the identification of an individual while still allowing the use of data for its intended purpose.

**1.1. De-identification Standards**

*   **Identifiers:**
    *   **Rule:** Delete identifiers from datasets.
    *   **Exception:** If absolutely essential, de-identify the identifier before use.
*   **Attribute Values:**
    *   **Rule:** Remove attribute values irrelevant to the data's purpose.
    *   **Strict De-identification:** Apply to unique values (e.g., rare disease, unique professional experiences) that could easily identify an individual.

**1.2. De-identification Process**

1.  **Personal Information:** Raw data containing identifiers.
2.  **De-identification:** Apply various methods to transform the data.
3.  **Evaluation:** Assess if the de-identification is adequate.
    *   **Adequate:** Data is anonymized (re-identification risk is low).
    *   **Inadequate:** Re-identification is possible; repeat de-identification or remove data.

**1.3. Examples of Personal Information Identifiers & Attributes**

These are examples of data that may need de-identification:

*   **Unique Identifiers:** Resident registration number, passport, driver's license, name, detailed address, specific dates (birthday, anniversary), phone numbers, medical/health insurance numbers, account/credit card numbers, vehicle numbers, photos, body identification (fingerprint, voice), email, IP/MAC address, URL, ID/employee/customer numbers, military serial number.
*   **Personal Characteristics:** Gender, age, nationality, hometown, marital status, religion, hobbies, smoking/drinking habits.
*   **Physical Characteristics:** Blood type, height, weight, medical exam results, disability type/level.
*   **Medical Information:** Disease name, injury/medication codes, treatment history.
*   **Credit Characteristics:** Tax payment, credit rating, donations, health insurance premiums, income quintile.
*   **Educational/Career Characteristics:** School, department, grade, career, job type, company, position, former workplace.
*   **Electronic Characteristics:** Cookie info, access/visit dates, service use records, internet/mobile usage, GPS data.
*   **Family Characteristics:** Spouse, children, parents, siblings, legal representative information.

**1.4. Methods of De-identification**

Methods can be used individually or in combination.

*   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing direct identifiers with artificial identifiers (pseudonyms).
    *   **Examples:** Heuristic pseudonymization (e.g., "Hong Gil-dong" -> "Lim Kkeokjeong"), Encryption, Swapping (exchanging values between records).
*   **Aggregation:** Summarizing data to remove individual details.
    *   **Examples:** Micro Aggregation (grouping similar records), Rounding (e.g., average height instead of individual heights).
*   **Data Reduction:** Removing or simplifying parts of the data.
    *   **Examples:** Rearrangement, Identifier deletion, Identifier partial deletion (e.g., "901206-7..." -> "90's born, male"), Reducing records, Complete deletion of identifiers.
*   **Data Suppression:** Hiding or omitting certain data points.
    *   **Examples:** Suppression (e.g., "35 years old" -> "30-40 years old"), Random rounding, Data ranging, Controlled rounding.
*   **Data Masking:** Obscuring data with random or fake values.
    *   **Examples:** Adding random noise, Blank and impute (e.g., "Hong Gil-dong" -> "Hong OO").

**1.5. De-identification Examples in Action**

| Original Data                                         | Data Deletion (Resident Reg. No.)                 | Data Masking (Reg. No., Hospitalization Date), Aggregation (Age) |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `770914-1234567` Male 2015/06/23 39 Flu                | Male 2015/06/23 39 Flu                            | `********-*******` Male 2015/*/** 35 Flu                       |

| `710119-2345678` Female 2014/01/21 45 High blood pres. | Female 2014/01/21 45 High blood pres.             | `********-*******` Female 2014/*/** 35 High blood pres.         |
| ...                                                   | ...                                               | ...                                                              |
| *(Note: Age is averaged to 35 across records)*         | *(Note: Resident registration numbers are removed)* | *(Note: Dates are masked, and age is aggregated)*               |

ESSENCE
+ De-identification  Standards  for Identifiers:  As a rule, an identifier included  in datasets  should be deleted.  However,
an identifier  that is absolutely  needed  for a purpose  of the use of data can be utilized  after de-identification.
+ De-identification  Standards  for Attribute  Values: As a rule, an attribute  value included in datasets  should be
also removed  if it is irrelevant  to a purpose  of the use of data. Attribute  values like rare disease  or unique
professional  experiences  need strict de-identification  as they are highly likely to identify  an individual  under certain
circumstances.

+ Methods  of De-identification:  A range of methods  including  pseudonymization,  aggregation,  data suppression and
data masking  can be used individually  or in combination.  There are various kinds of technology  in place to realize
each method.  The most suitable methods  and specific  techniques  need to be chosen and utilized based on the
purpose  of data usage, and strengths  and weaknesses  of each method.
