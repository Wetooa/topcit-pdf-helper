    *   Consider different levels of component granularity and development approaches (top-down/bottom-up).
    *   **Deliverables for reuse:** Architecture, source code, data, designs, documents, estimates (templates), human interfaces, plans, requirements, test cases.

**F) Effects of Software Reuse**
*   Reduces Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for software production.
*   Enables sharing and utilization of high-quality software.
*   Promotes information and deliverable sharing across projects.
*   Provides educational benefits on system structure and good system development practices.

### 02. Reverse Engineering

**A) Definition**
*   **Reverse Engineering:** A software engineering process where a developed system is deconstructed to extract design information, documentation, and underlying techniques.
*   **Purpose:** To understand, analyze, modify, or recreate documentation for an existing system, especially during maintenance.
*   **Opposite of Forward Engineering:** Forward engineering builds sequentially from design; reverse engineering works backward from existing code/system to design/documentation.
*   **Input:** Source code, object code, work procedures, libraries, etc.
*   **Output:** Structure diagrams, data flow charts, control flow graphs, entity-relationship diagrams, etc.

**B) Reasons Why Reverse Engineering is Necessary**
*   Difficulty maintaining a running system.
*   Decreased system efficiency due to frequent changes.
*   Redeveloping a legacy system (e.g., file-based to relational database).
*   Downsizing from a mainframe system.

**C) Advantages of Reverse Engineering**
*   Allows analysis of commercial or previously developed software.
*   Improves maintainability by analyzing existing system data and information at the design level.
*   Facilitates CASE tool usage by storing existing system information in a repository.

**D) Types of Reverse Engineering**
*   **Logic Reverse Engineering:** Extracts information from source code to create or store physical design information (e.g., system logic, control flow).
*   **Data Reverse Engineering:** Modifies an existing database or migrates it to a new database management system (e.g., schema analysis, transformation).

### Ill. Data Structure and Algorithm

**Learning Objectives (Key Concepts to Understand):**
*   **Data Structure:** Definition, classification, understanding linear (e.g., Array, List, Stack, Queue, Deque) and nonlinear (e.g., Tree, Graph) structures.
*   **Algorithm:** Definition, performance analysis, and common algorithms like sorting and searching.

01 Software  Reuse
A) Overview  of software  reuse
The term “software  reuse” means to develop new software  using existing  software  or software  knowledge.
Reusable  software  or software  knowledge  is a reusable  asset comprising  design, requirements,  inspection,  and
architecture.
@ Background  to software  reuse
+ Deterioration  of quality and productivity  due to a software  crisis.
+ Increased  use of CASE tools due to the development  of automation  technology  in software  development.
+ Efforts  to comply  with software  development  standardization  and secure quality.
@ Definition  of software  reuse
+ Software  reuse is a method of standardizing  knowledge  about software development  (function,  module,
configuration,  etc.) and configuring  it to be suitable for repeated  use in order to increase  development
productivity.
+ Countermeasures  that increase  the quality, productivity,  and reliability  of newly developed  software and
reduce the development  schedule  and cost by reusing  all or a part of software  that has been recognized  for
its development  functions,  performance,  and quality.
+ A concept  whereby  developed  modules,  programs  and deliverables  are directly reused or reused after some
modifications  in the same application  field, or are reused for different  application  duties or by different
companies
@ Purpose  of software  reuse
Goal Contents
Responsibility Performance  such as functions,  stability,  speed, etc. has already  been proved.
Scalability Easy to upgrade  based on proven functions.
Productivity Improvement  of the overall development  process, such as cost, time, risk, etc.
B) Target  of software  reuse
Various  subjects  can utilize software  reuse.
@ General  knowledge
+ Environmental  information:  Knowledge  obtained  through  education  and use.
+ External  knowledge:  Knowledge  obtained  by participating  in the development  and the specific  field.
@ Design information
+ System  architecture
+ System  design

@ Data information

+ Test cases
@ Program  code
+ Module
+ Program
© Others
+ Cost benefit  analysis
+ User documentation
+ Feasibility  studies
+ Prototype
+ People
C) Principle  of software  reuse
@ Generality: Software  should be generally  reusable,  rather  than designed  for a specific  area of application.
@ Modularity:  The principle  of information  hiding and abstraction.  Software  reuse should have the characteristics of
minimum  coupling  and maximum  cohesion.
@ Hardware  independence:  Reused software  should be independent  of execution  hardware  as much as possible.
@ Software  independence:  Reused  software  should be independent  of the OS or DBMS.
© Self-documentation:  The accurate  function,  usage, and interface  of the module  should be described.
© Commonality:  Reused  software  should be commonly  needed  and usable by many developers.
@ Reliability:  Reused  software  should be reliable  during  use.
D) Problems  when reusing  software  for practical  business
+ Itis difficult  to find software  modules  that can be used in common.
+ Software  is not very standardized.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the internal  interface  requirements  of the software  module.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the side effects  of the change.
+ The development  of software  components  for reuse can be more costly.
+ The benefits  of software  reuse may only be recognized  after a long time.
+ It is impractical  to extract  components  for reuse from existing  software  components.
E) Obstacles  to software  reuse and countermeasures
@ Obstacles  to software  reuse
+ Adverse  reaction  of managers  and developers.
+ Lack of motivation  to apply reuse technology.
+ Lack of software  standardization.
+ Social or legal obstacles.
