## Part 2: Understanding ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

### 2.1 Definition of ERP
ERP is a system that **integrates various management resources** (finance, HR, production, etc.) of an enterprise into a single system to **maximize overall productivity and efficiency**.

**Goal:** To maximize enterprise-wide business efficiency by integrating key business processes and enabling information sharing.

**Benefits:**
*   Integrated work support across business operations.
*   Systematic linking of different business aspects.
*   Efficient data sharing.
*   Increased organizational flexibility.

### 2.2 Characteristics of ERP

*   **Integration:** Connects all related business operations (finance, accounting, manufacturing, sales, service) without redundancies.
*   **Flexibility:** Customizable settings to suit unique business operations and user needs.
*   **Openness:** Based on international standards, designed with an open structure to integrate with diverse platforms, hardware, and software.
*   **International:** Supports multiple languages and manages local data (e.g., tax items, addresses, currencies) for multinational corporations.

### 2.3 Configuration of ERP
ERP organizes most operational functions of an enterprise, ensuring interdependencies and balanced resource distribution.

**Example Flow:**
1.  Customer places an order.
2.  Sales enters order into ERP.
3.  Order data (quantity, delivery, timing) is communicated to relevant departments.
4.  Data on raw materials (procurement, price, quantity) is sent to production.
5.  Factory produces the order; production data is entered into ERP.
6.  Production data transmitted to shipping.
7.  Shipping delivers goods to customer.
ERP provides the environment for these operations to happen organically.

**Core Components of ERP (as per Fig. 30):**
*   **Integrated Business Process:** Supports diverse business processes and dynamic interlinking of operational modules.
*   **Integrated Database:** Enterprise-wide resource database, shared across different business areas.
*   **Best Practice / Management Techniques:** Adopts standard operating processes and includes Business Process Redesign (BPR) functions.

**Key Modules/Functions often found in ERP:**
*   **Customer Management:** Purchase, Distribution, Customer, Promotion, Cost estimation.
*   **HR Management:** HR, Education, Attendance, Salary, Absenteeism.
*   **Finance & Accounting:** Bond rights, Fund management, Cost management, General account ledger, Profitability analysis.
*   **Manufacturing, Production & Service Delivery:** Production, Material, Price, Sales, Order, Service management.

### 2.4 ERP Deployment Procedure
Deployment should be viewed as business innovation, not just system introduction. It requires analyzing existing processes, identifying improvement points, and undergoing radical transformation through Process Innovation (PI). CEO support is critical for success.

**Typical Steps:**

1.  **Project Launch:**
    *   Write project plan.
    *   Write quality assurance plan.
2.  **Analysis:**
    *   Analyze current and future processes.
    *   Conduct gap analysis (differences between current and future).
    *   Draw up gap response plan.
    *   Provide package/module/language education.
3.  **Design:**
    *   Set up processes, functions, and master data.
    *   Define interface and prototyping.
    *   Design additional development.
    *   Design data codes.
    *   Establish test plan and interface design.
4.  **Development:**
    *   Develop functions.
    *   Perform unit-level testing.
    *   Perform regression testing (connection between existing and new modules).
    *   Conduct outside link (interface) integrated test.
5.  **Implementation:**
    *   Perform data conversion.
    *   Provide training on system usage.
    *   Carry out a pilot operation.

### 2.5 ERP Deployment Strategy
There are three main approaches:

| Method                  | Description                                                  | Strengths                                         | Weaknesses                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Big Bang**            | All modules and functions deployed simultaneously across all operational areas. | Easy integration of the package itself, easy implementation. | Projects tend to be large-scale, difficult project management.  |
| **Phased (Functional)** | ERP modules deployed by function and in phases.              | Little resistance to changes.                     | Additional programs may be needed to link to existing systems. |
| **Phased (Place of Business)** | ERP system deployed in phases at each business location, then expanded. | Good use of human resources (recycled in phases). | Project prolongation, high likelihood of redundant work.       |

**ERP Vendors & Considerations:**
*   **Leading Foreign Solutions:** SAP ERP, Oracle ERP.
*   **Leading Domestic Solutions:** Younglimwon ERP, Douzone ERP.
*   **Advantages of Commercial ERP:** Standardized processes.
*   **Disadvantages of Commercial ERP:** Difficult to customize for unique enterprise environments.
*   **Important Check:** Ensure compliance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), which are global accounting standards.

## Part 3: Understanding SCM (Supply Chain Management)

### 3.1 Concept of SCM
SCM refers to **Supply Chain Management solutions**.

**Supply Chain:** Encompasses the entire process from order placement, raw material supply, production, distribution network, to final delivery to the customer.

### 3.2 The Bullwhip Effect (The Biggest Problem in Supply Chains)
*   **Definition:** A phenomenon where a small change in end-consumer demand causes a sudden and significantly expanded demand upstream in the supply chain.
    *   **Example:** If a consumer orders 10 items, the retailer might order 12 "just in case," the wholesaler 15, and the manufacturer 20.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Overstocked supply chain.
    *   Wasted resources, unnecessary investments in manpower and facilities.
    *   Distorted demand and increased variance at each step upstream.
    *   High risks for raw material suppliers.
    *   Inefficiency across the entire supply chain due to demand imbalance.
    *   Results in surplus orders, excess inventory, and overinvestment.

### 3.3 Goal and How SCM Works
**Goal of SCM:** To maximize efficiency by rectifying the bullwhip effect and eliminating waste throughout the supply chain.

**How it Works:**
*   Supply chain players cooperate to manage materials, funds, and information.
*   It links and integrates the flow of all goods, services, and values (purchasing, manufacture, allocation, distribution) from suppliers to end customers.

**Effects of SCM:**
*   Shortened lead time.
*   Reduced uncertainties and variabilities.

**Overall:** SCM is a management technique focused on optimizing inventory management and other supply chain decisions.

ESSENCE
There is the supply chain management  (SCM) system,  which integrates  the entire supply chain from purchasing  to
production  and eventual delivery  to customers.  With SCM, an enterprise  can manage how many raw materials  to
purchase,  sort them into product  groups, and manufacture  products  in a timely manner  ready for delivery  when the
customers  need them.
Because  the analysis  of customers  is a critical factor of competition,  the customer  relationship  management  (CRM)
system is a solution on which enterprises  depend to properly  analyze customer  needs, enhance  the service for
customers,  and strengthen  customer  relationships  for additional  value delivery.
C) Business  strategy  and enterprise  solution
In enterprise  solutions,  communication  with customers,  product  management,  and process integration  should be
organically  linked. These aspects  must be comprehensively  managed  so that enterprises  can execute  their business
strategies  efficiently  and achieve  their business  goals.
The environment  surrounding  an enterprise  changes  fluidly every minute;as  such, enterprises  are always faced with
the challenge  of responding  nimbly in order to survive.  Thus, companies  have no other choice but to tailor and change
their strategies  to fit the environmental  changes.  The adoption  of enterprise  solutions  that satisfy  the strategic  goals
of an enterprise  is an unavoidable  choice.
There are countless  enterprise  solutions  required  by businesses.  However,  the solutions  that most enterprises
absolutely  need to deploy  or need to develop  on their own in one form or another  can be defined using just a handful
of solutions.  There are also situations  in which enterprises,  as they grow in scale, are forced to adopt a particular
solution  to meet the IT compliance  requirements.

The figure above illustrates the interrelationship  between  a business  strategy  and various enterprise  solutions.  For
each application  and purpose,  an enterprise  solution  is tied to a particular  strategy  item. In other words, enterprise
solutions  are adopted  in a manner  befitting  a particular  strategy  (as well as the sub-details  of each strategy)  of an
enterprise.
