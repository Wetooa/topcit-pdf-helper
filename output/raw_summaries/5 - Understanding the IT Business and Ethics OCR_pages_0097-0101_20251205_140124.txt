## Learning Guide: IT Business Decision-Making Support Systems

This guide covers essential concepts related to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDW), Decision Support Systems (DSS), and Business Intelligence (BI).

---

### 1. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)

**What it is:**
*   A centralized system that consolidates information related to product and project development.
*   Helps manage increasing complexity in product development.

**Key Functions:**
*   **BOM Management:** Manages the **Bill of Materials** (a complete list of raw materials, parts, and assemblies needed to build a product).
*   **Development Process Standardization:** Ensures consistent processes across projects.
*   **Workflow-based Change Management:** Manages changes efficiently through defined workflows.

**Benefits:**
*   Maximizes product development efficiency.

**Modern Trends:**
*   **Integration:** PLM is increasingly integrated with **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** and **MDM (Master Data Management)** solutions.
    *   **ERP:** Software that integrates core business processes (e.g., finance, HR, supply chain).
    *   **MDM:** Manages consistent master data across the enterprise.
*   **Enterprise-wide Data Management:** Aims to manage reference data from an entire organizational perspective.
*   **Future:** Expansion into "Social PLM" by linking with external data.

### 2. IT Business Decision-Making Support Systems

Businesses need accurate and timely information to make rational decisions, especially in fast-changing environments. Manual analysis of large data volumes is impractical, leading to the need for specialized systems.

**Two Leading Systems:**
1.  **Decision Support System (DSS):** Focuses on quantitative analysis for specific decisions (e.g., ROI, break-even points).
2.  **Business Intelligence (BI):** Monitors the business environment, detects changes, and provides insights for agile responses through data discovery, extraction, and analysis.

### 3. Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)

The EDW is a foundational data repository for enterprise data analytics, underpinning both DSS and BI.

**A. Definition of EDW:**
*   A system that integrates internal and external enterprise data.
*   Organizes data by "subject matter" to fulfill user information analysis requests.
*   Requires robust infrastructure to support enterprise data across all business aspects.

**B. Evolution:**
*   Initially focused on internal data.
*   Now evolving into a forecasting system that integrates both internal and external information.

**C. Necessity for EDW:**
*   **Uniform Viewpoint:** Consolidates all enterprise information (internal & external) into master data for a consistent organizational perspective.
*   **Forecasting & Strategy:** Enables diverse data analyses to support strategic choices and adapt to changing user requirements and business environments.
*   **Data Integrity:** Integrates information resources and reorganizes management systems to prevent data duplication.

**D. Characteristics of EDW:**
*   **Subject-Oriented:** Structures the system around specific topics for data analysis, not daily transactions. Extracts and integrates internal/external data. Standardizes data formats.
*   **Integrated:** Combines data from various sources into a consistent format.
*   **Time Variant:** Stores data reflecting specific time elements (day, week, month) while maintaining accuracy over time.
*   **Non-volatile:** Once data is stored, its properties do not change. Data is primarily read-only and is not deleted unless specific rules dictate.

**E. Configuration of EDW:**
*   **Macro Perspective:** The entire process of collecting, transforming, loading, analyzing, and visualizing data for decision support.
*   **Micro Perspective:** Refers specifically to the central repository where data is stored.
*   **Process:** Transaction data from legacy systems is stored in the Data Warehouse, then analyzed and visualized using BI solutions.

### 4. Decision Support System (DSS)

**A. Concept of DSS:**
*   An interactive system designed to support decision-makers during the decision-making process.
*   Assists in solving **semi-structural** (partially defined) and **non-structural** (complex, undefined) problems.
*   **Core Elements:** Enterprise data (internal/external) and analytical models for processing quantitative data.

**B. Characteristics of DSS:**
*   **Resolves Non-structural Problems:** Primarily assists CEOs and middle managers with complex issues.
*   **Easy-to-Use User Interface:** Provides interactive interfaces that are user-friendly.
*   **Improves Decision-Making Effectiveness:** Focuses on finding optimal solutions rather than just processing efficiency.
*   **Model and Database Support:** Offers various tools like financial/statistical models, simulations, and statistical techniques to solve complex problems.

**C. Configuration of DSS:**
*   Comprises a **Document System**, a **Model System**, and a **Knowledge System**.
*   Users interact through a **User Interface** to access information and manage data/models.

**D. Constituent Elements of DSS:**
*   **Database Management System:** Stores all corporate activity data (financial, accounting, marketing, production, HR) used as basic decision data.
*   **Model Base Management System:** Analytical tools (e.g., statistical, forecasting, linear planning, simulation models) developed to solve similar types of problems consistently, improving efficiency and accuracy.
*   **Knowledge Base System:** Provides qualitative information to support unstructured decision-making problems that are hard to quantify.
*   **User Interface Management System:** The communication channel between the decision-maker and the DSS, ensuring flexibility, performance, and convenience.

**E. DSS Data Models:**
*   Provide a framework for analyzing data to support rational decisions.
*   Continuously developed and improved, with a recent trend towards integrating **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** for better forecasting.

**Types of DSS Data Models:**
*   **What-if Analysis:** Examines how changes in one variable impact another, useful for testing assumptions about uncertain future situations.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Observes how changes in one or two input variables affect other variables in an equation model.
*   **Goal-seeking:** Determines the values of variables needed to achieve a predefined goal.
*   **Optimization Analysis:** Finds the optimal value(s) for target variables under specific constraints.

---

### 5. Business Intelligence (BI)

**A. Concept of BI:**
*   A set of processes to improve business decisions and performance by summarizing, analyzing, and using enterprise data and information.
*   While DSS is often for high-level decision-makers, BI is designed to be adopted by regular employees for everyday decision support.
*   **"Intelligence" (Hans Luhn, IBM, 1958):** The ability to understand relationships between facts to achieve a desired goal.
*   **Evolution:** BI evolved from DSS, with analysis technologies like **Data Warehouses** and **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** developing in the late 1980s based on DSS principles.
    *   **OLAP:** Enables users to easily extract and view data from different business perspectives.

**B. Key Purpose:**
*   To improve the quality of business management decisions and overall business performance through comprehensive data analysis.

ESSENCE
+ As the number  of projects  and products  in need of development  increased  and became  more difficult  to manage,  it
became  necessary  to consolidate  the scattered  information.
+ Included  in the centralized  system were a number  of items that served as important  reference  data when designing
items and products;  such as BOM (bill of materials)  management,  development  process standardization,  and the
workflow-based  change management  function,  etc. The inclusion  of these items made it possible  to maximize  the
efficiency  of product  development.
+ Recently,  the trend among  companies  has gravitated  towards  consolidating  the PLM through  the integration  of ERP
and MDM solutions  for the purpose  of managing  the reference  data from the enterprise-wide  perspective.  In the
future, PLM will be expanded  to include  the social PLM area by linking it with external  data.
03 IT Business  Decision-Making  Support  System
In order for an enterprise  to make a business  decision,  it has to have access to internal/external  information, as the
collection,  analysis and processing  of such information  is critical to making a rational decision.  Data generated  by a
general-purpose  work support  system are simply too voluminous  to be analyzed  by hand in the expectation  that
some meaningful  implications  could be derived from them. In particular,  there are many times when decisions  have
to be made within  a limited  timeframe:  and, in recent years, the fast changing  nature of business  environments  has
led to rising uncertainties,  which has in turn forced companies  to frequently  conduct  complex  analyses,  increasing  the
demand  for systems  capable  of supporting  decision  making.
The two leading information  systems  that provide such support  to enterprises  are the decision-making  support
system and the business  intelligence  system.  The decision-making  support  system is used when making make
decisions  that require a quantitative  analysis,  such as an analysis  of a company’s  return on investment  and its break-
even points. Meanwhile,  business intelligence  systems  enable companies  to respond with agility by monitoring  the
business  operating  environment  and detecting  changes  through  the discovery,  extraction,  and analysis of business
data.
Before looking  at the two systems,  let's start with the concept  of the enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW), an enterprise
data repository  that underpins  enterprise  data analytics.
A) Understanding  EDW
@ Definition  of EDW
The enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW) is a system that can address,  by subject  matter, information  analysis  requests
by users, through  the integration  of internal and external  data. The EDW requires  the construction  of infrastructure
that serves as the backbone  of enterprise  data. This infrastructure  touches  every area and aspect  of an enterprise’s
business.
+ In the beginning,  the EDW mostly  encompassed  the internal  data of an enterprise.  Today, however,  it is evolving  into
a forecasting  system  that integrates  both the internal and external  information  of an enterprise.

@ The necessity  for the EDW
f an enterprise  wishes to maintain  uniformity  of viewpoint  across its entire organization,  it must consolidate  the
information  that it possesses  and any external  information  it needs from an enterprise-wide  perspective  and keep it
as the master  information.
n today’s rapidly changing  business  environment,  enterprises  have to extract enterprise-perspective  data by
conducting  diverse data analyses  for users in diverse sectors. This is because  enterprises  need to have sufficient
orecasting  capability  for making  strategic choices  and responding  to changing  user requirements  brought  about by
changes  in the business  environment.  Enterprises  also have to integrate  their information  resources  and reorganize
heir management  system  as part of redesigning  their system  to prevent  data duplication.
@ Characteristics  of the EDW
The EDW was created  with a clear purpose  for its use. The concept  explains  a very import characteristic  of the EDW,
amely, that of being topic-centered.  Upon adopting  the EDW, critical data within and outside  the company  become
concentrated  and consolidated  in one place; and data are loaded and used in a time-based  order. Once stored, data
will not be destroyed  or changed  unless there is a particular  reason for doing so. These characteristics  of the EDW are
described  in detail as follows.5
