### IV. Data Modeling

#### 4.1 Concept and Procedure of Data Modeling
*   **A. Requirements Collection and Analysis:** The starting point for any data modeling effort.
*   **B. DB Design:** Data modeling is a crucial phase within overall database design.
*   **C. Conceptual/Logical Modeling (Academic vs. Industry):** Understand potential differences in terminology and emphasis between theoretical and practical approaches.
*   **D. Process Modeling:** Focuses on modeling the sequence of activities and processes within a system.
*   **E. Correlation Modeling:** Focuses on identifying and representing relationships or dependencies between different data entities.

#### 4.2 Data Modeling Procedure (3 Phases)
*   **A. Conceptual Modeling:**
    *   **Purpose:** High-level, abstract representation of data, independent of specific technology. Focuses on entities and their relationships from a business perspective.
    *   **Output:** Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
*   **B. Logical Modeling:**
    *   **Purpose:** Detailed representation of data, defining all attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys. Independent of a specific DBMS, but structured for a chosen data model (e.g., relational).
    *   **Output:** Detailed ERD or Relational Schema.
*   **C. Physical Model:**
    *   **Purpose:** Concrete implementation details for a specific DBMS. Defines tables, columns, data types, indexes, and storage parameters.
    *   **Output:** DDL (Data Definition Language) scripts.

#### 4.3 Types of ER Notations
*   Learn about different graphical conventions used in ERDs (e.g., Chen Notation, Crow's Foot Notation, UML Class Diagrams).

#### 4.4 ER Notation Based on the Chen Model
*   **A. Entity:** A real-world object or concept (e.g., `Student`, `Course`). Represented by a rectangle.
*   **B. Relationship:** An association between two or more entities (e.g., `enrolls in`). Represented by a diamond.
*   **C. Attribute:** A property or characteristic of an entity or relationship (e.g., `StudentName`, `CourseID`). Represented by an oval.

#### 4.5 Extended ER (EER) Model
*   **A. Generalization/Specialization:**
    *   **Generalization:** Combining common features of multiple entities into a higher-level entity (e.g., `Car`, `Truck` -> `Vehicle`).
    *   **Specialization:** Subdividing a higher-level entity into lower-level entities with specific attributes (e.g., `Employee` -> `SalariedEmployee`, `HourlyEmployee`).
*   **B. Aggregation:** Treating a relationship as an entity for the purpose of participating in another relationship (e.g., a `Works_On` relationship can participate in a `Manages` relationship).

#### 4.6 Core ER Concepts and Characteristics
*   **A. Entity, Attribute, Identifier:** Reinforce definitions. An **Identifier** (Primary Key) uniquely identifies an entity instance.
*   **B. Characteristics of the Entity:** Properties like existence dependency (strong vs. weak entities).
*   **C. Classification of Entities:** Categorizing entities (e.g., strong, weak, associative, intersection).
*   **D. Classification of Attributes:** Categorizing attributes (e.g., simple, composite, single-valued, multi-valued, derived, key attributes).
*   **E. Relationship:** Understand cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and participation (optional, mandatory).
*   **F. How to Read Relationships:** Interpret the meaning of connections between entities.
*   **G. Characteristic of the Identifier:** Properties of a good identifier (unique, non-null, stable, minimal).
*   **H. Classification of Identifiers:** Types of keys (Primary Key, Candidate Key, Super Key, Foreign Key).
*   **I. Identifier Relationship and Non-Identifier Relationship:** Relationships formed via primary/foreign keys vs. other forms of association.
*   **J. Super-type and Sub-type:** Further details on generalization and specialization hierarchies.

#### 4.7 Connection Trap
*   **A. Fan Trap:** Ambiguity in a relationship pathway when two (or more) one-to-many relationships fan out from a single entity.
*   **B. Chasm Trap:** Ambiguity where a relationship path might imply a connection that doesn't exist for all instances, due to optional participation.

#### 4.8 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
*   **A. Class Conversion:** How object-oriented classes and their properties are mapped to relational database tables and columns.
*   **B. Conversion of Class Relation into Relational Relationship:** How object relationships (e.g., associations, inheritance) are translated into foreign key relationships in a relational schema.

#### 4.9 Integrity and Key
*   **A. Integrity:** Ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data.
    *   **Entity Integrity:** Primary key must be unique and not null.
    *   **Referential Integrity:** Foreign key values must either be null or match an existing primary key value in the referenced table.
    *   **Domain Integrity:** Ensures that all column values fall within a defined set of valid values.
*   **B. Key:** Review different types of keys (Primary, Foreign, Candidate, Super) and their role in enforcing integrity.

### V. Normalization and Denormalization

#### 5.1 Normalization and Anomalies
*   **Normalization:** A process of organizing columns and tables in a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
*   **Anomalies:** Problems that can occur in unnormalized databases due to data redundancy.
    *   **A. Insertion Anomaly:** Inability to insert data about one entity without having data about another.
    *   **B. Deletion Anomaly:** Loss of data about one entity when deleting data about another.
    *   **C. Update Anomaly:** Inconsistency arises when updating redundant data in multiple places.

#### 5.2 Concept of Functional Dependency and Rule of Inference
*   **A. Functional Dependency (FD):** An attribute B is functionally dependent on attribute A if, for every valid instance of A, that value uniquely determines the value of B (A → B). Crucial for normalization.
*   **B. Armstrong's Axioms:** A set of inference rules used to derive all possible functional dependencies from a given set of dependencies.

#### 5.3 Database Design Using Normal Forms (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Boyce-Codd)
*   **A. Normalization Process:** Understand the step-by-step procedure to move data through different normal forms.
*   **B. Example of Normalization:** Apply normalization to a sample table:
    *   **1st Normal Form (1NF):** Eliminate repeating groups; ensure all attributes are atomic (single-valued).
    *   **2nd Normal Form (2NF):** Be in 1NF and eliminate partial dependencies (non-key attributes depend on only part of a composite primary key).
    *   **3rd Normal Form (3NF):** Be in 2NF and eliminate transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes).
    *   **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** A stricter version of 3NF; every determinant (attribute on the left side of an FD) must be a candidate key.

#### 5.4 Fourth Normalization (4NF)
*   **A. Concept of 4NF:** Deals with multi-valued dependencies (MVDs).
*   **B. Characteristics of 4NF:** Be in BCNF and eliminate multi-valued dependencies (when two or more independent multi-valued facts exist about an entity).
*   **C. Targets of 4NF:** Tables with independent multi-valued attributes that don't directly relate to each other.
*   **D. Performing 4NF:** Steps to decompose tables to achieve 4NF.

#### 5.5 Fifth Normalization (5NF)
*   **A. Concept of 5NF:** Deals with join dependencies, often called Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF).
*   **B. Characteristics of 5NF:** Be in 4NF and eliminate join dependencies (when a table can be decomposed into smaller tables and then re-joined without loss of information).
*   **C. Performing 5NF:** Steps to achieve 5NF.

#### 5.6 Denormalization
*   **A. Concept and Procedure of Denormalization:**
    *   **Concept:** Intentionally introducing redundancy into a normalized database to improve query performance.
    *   **Procedure:** Identify performance bottlenecks, carefully select data to be duplicated or combined, understand trade-offs (performance vs. data integrity risk).
*   **B. Actual Denormalization:** Practical examples of when and how to denormalize (e.g., adding a derived column, merging tables, creating summary tables).

#### 5.7 Considerations for Performance Design
*   Factors to consider during database design to optimize query speed and system responsiveness (e.g., indexing strategies, partitioning, caching, query optimization techniques, hardware selection).
