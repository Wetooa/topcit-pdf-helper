## Learning Guide: Business & IT Process Improvement Concepts

This guide covers Business Process Reengineering (BPR), Process Innovation (PI), Six Sigma, and TRIZ.

---

### A) Understanding Business Process Reengineering (BPR)

**1. Concept of BPR**
*   **Origin:** Introduced by Professor Michael Hammer (MIT, 1990) to address declining U.S. product competitiveness (price and quality) by fixing issues in overall business processes.
*   **Definition:** A technique for fundamentally redesigning business processes to achieve radical improvements in performance indicators like cost, quality, service, and speed.
*   **Four Attributes of BPR:**
    *   **Basic:** Addresses fundamental problems and inefficiencies in an enterprise's operations.
    *   **Zero Base:** Designs new ways of performing tasks by abandoning existing procedures. It's about starting fresh, not improving existing methods.
    *   **Dramatic Improvement:** Aims for radical, not gradual, improvements. Used when absolute innovation is needed.
    *   **Process:** Focuses on task processes, not specific jobs, workers, or organizational structures, to internalize processes that drive business value.

**2. BPR Implementation Procedure**
1.  **Set Corporate Objectives:** Establish goals aligned with the corporate vision (e.g., reduce costs, save time, improve quality).
2.  **Select Target Process:** Identify key processes, define their scope, and prioritize them through strategic evaluation.
3.  **Understand Current Process:** Analyze how the selected process currently operates and evaluate its performance level.
4.  **Select Process Goals:** Choose specific improvement goals for the process, linking them to the corporate vision.
5.  **Design Improved Process:** Create a new process to achieve the selected goals, and pilot a prototype.
6.  **Develop Change Model:** Address potential resistance (company, technology) and plan the transition.
7.  **Implement:** Transition from the current process to the improved one, implementing risk reduction strategies.
8.  **Operate:** Run the new prototype and transition to ongoing quality control management.

### B) Understanding Process Innovation (PI)

**1. Concept of PI**
*   **Definition:** Activity aimed at improving the business environment to maximize corporate value by eliminating unnecessary elements and rebuilding effective business processes.
*   **Origin:** Introduced by David Port (1993) in his paper "Process Innovation."
*   **Relationship to BPR:** Similar to BPR, but with a **greater emphasis on the integration of information technology (IT)**.
*   **Objective:** Build a customer-centric structure that can respond to changes in the business environment by improving current processes, information flow, logistics, and values.
*   **Regional Context:** While BPR is widely used internationally, PI gained popularity in South Korea (e.g., Samsung Electronics, POSCO's ERP adoption) and is used in a broader sense there.

**2. PI Implementation Procedure (with IT integration)**
*   PI is often implemented with IT deployment, typically through **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) integration.
*   **Typical Flow:**
    1.  Improve and redesign enterprise systems, processes, and workforce.
    2.  Establish an informatization (IT implementation) plan based on improved systems/processes.
    3.  Deploy a system (e.g., ERP, CRM) capable of executing the plan.
*   **Detailed Steps (as per Fig. 25):**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze AS-IS (current) processes, systems, and human resources. Set Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
    *   **PI To-Be Process Design:** Design the future (To-Be) process focusing on achieving CSF/KPI based strategies.
    *   **Organization & IT Strategy:** Establish IT strategies aligned with business strategies, including mid/long-term information system plans and an IT architecture roadmap.
    *   **Implementation:** Develop a detailed plan to establish an integrated information system and deploy it step-by-step.

**3. Relationship between PI and ERP**
*   PI improves systems, processes, and workforce, laying groundwork for data and process integration. This is followed by building the integrated system.
*   **Two Approaches:**
    1.  Adopting ERP *through* PI.
    2.  Using ERP to *accelerate* PI implementation.
*   Regardless of the approach, a strategic adoption plan tailored to the enterprise's circumstances is crucial.

**4. PI and Change Management**
*   **Challenge:** After innovative process improvements, organizations need time to adapt, leading to a temporary drop in productivity.
*   **Importance:** Successful PI projects require effective management of expectations, resistance, insecurity, and motivation at each project stage.
*   **Key Success Factors:**
    *   Strong support from top management.
    *   Company-wide consensus on the need for change.
    *   Choosing the right technique for the situation and goals.
    *   Clear goals and plans for implementation.
    *   Leveraging capable internal/external talent.
    *   Motivated, high-energy environment.
*   **Key Stumbling Blocks:**
    *   Resistance to change.
    *   Lack of strong leadership/support.
*   **Leadership Role:** CEO and leaders must display strong leadership, share the vision, organize resources for change, encourage participation, and help individuals/teams adapt to the new environment.
*   **Outcome:** Successful change management is vital for stable PI establishment and project success.

### C) Understanding Six Sigma

**1. Overview of Six Sigma**
*   **Definition:** A quality innovation movement and methodology.
*   **Origin:** Started by Motorola in 1987.
*   **Goal:** Achieve a defect rate of less than three defects per one million products (a "6 Sigma" quality level) by analyzing and quantifying causes of inefficiencies.
*   **Three Pillars:** Statistical measurement, business strategy, and philosophy (transforming work methods).

**2. Characteristics of Six Sigma**
*   Emphasizes **statistical measurement** and objective quantification of process innovations.
*   An **enterprise-wide** process innovation activity, not limited to specific departments.
*   Ultimate goal is to improve **customer value and satisfaction**.
*   Fosters a **passionate organizational culture** where all members continuously pursue improvements.

**3. Six Sigma Hierarchy**
*   **Champion:**
    *   **Qualifications:** Executive with leadership skills.
    *   **Role:** Suggests Six Sigma vision/philosophy, disseminates concepts, oversees implementation, provides resources.
*   **Master Black Belt:**
    *   **Qualifications:** Practical experience and knowledge.
    *   **Role:** Provides Black Belt/Green Belt training, teaches Six Sigma concepts and methodology.
*   **Black Belt:**

ESSENCE
A) Understanding  BPR
The concept  of business  process  reengineering  (BPR) was first introduced  in a paper published  by Professor  Michael
Hammer  of MIT in 1990. As products  from Asian countries  began to penetrate  the US market, US products  began
losing their competitiveness,  so Professor  Hammer  sought  to address  the root causes  of this problem  in his paper.
After analyzing  the causes of the decline  in U.S. competitiveness,  Hammer  found that U.S. products  were not actually
lagging behind in terms of product  competitiveness,  but that they were losing competitiveness  in terms of price and
quality. For American  companies  to provide the product  values that customers  were looking for, Hammer  felt that
the solution  lay in resolving  the problems  in the overall business  process,  and thus proposed  the concept  of BPR as a
solution  to those problems  in his paper.
@® Concept  of BPR
BPR is a technique  for redesigning  business  processes  in a fundamental  way in order to bring about a radical
improvement  in such performance  indicators  as cost, quality, service, and quickness.  There are four attributes  of BPR
that should be mentioned  here.
+ The first attribute  is ‘Basic’: In BPR, activities  are performed  to address  the basic problems  of an enterprise.  Through
BPR, answers  are sought  to such questions  as “For what purpose  is a business  task performed?”  “What are the
current  problems?”  and “What are the inefficient  elements  of an enterprise’s  operations?”
+ The second attribute  is ‘Zero Base’: BPR is all about designing  a new way of performing  business  tasks by
abandoning  existing  task procedures  or processes.
+ The third attribute is ‘Dramatic  Improvement’:  BPR is used only when an absolute  innovation  is needed.  Thus, BPR
signifies  a radical improvement  rather than a gradual improvement.
+ The fourth attribute  is ‘Process’:  The targets of BPR are mainly task processes.  BPR strives to resolve problems
through process-centric  thinking,  without  relying on jobs, workers,  or organizational  structures.  The aim is to
internalize  the processes  that drive business  values.

B) Understanding  PI
@® Concept  of PI
Process  innovation  (PI) is the activity  of improving  the business  environment  to maximize  corporate  value. P| seeks to
eliminate  unnecessary  elements  (across  all aspects  of corporate  activities ranging  from business  process  to organization
and IT) and rebuild effective  business  processes,
Plis similar  to BPR, but it was introduced  in 1993 when David Port of the United States published  his paper titled ‘Process
Innovation’.  Pl can be understood  best as BPR, but with a greater  emphasis  on the integration  of information  technology.
The objective  of Pl is to build a structure  that can respond  to changes  in the business  environment  surrounding  an
enterprise  by improving  the current  business  processes  and the flow of information,  logistics  and values in a direction
that is more customer-centric.  Internationally,  the concept  of BPR developed by  Michael Hammer  is used widely.
But in South Korea, the concept  of Pl became  more popular  after it was first used by Samsung  Electronics  and after
POSCO adopted  a Pl-based  ERP as a strategy  for improving  its business  processes.  In South Korea, PI is used in a
broader  sense than BPR.
@ Example  of P| implementation  procedure
Generally,  Pl is implemented  in conjunction  with the deployment  of information  technology. A typical situation  is
when an enterprise  carries out sudden improvements  of its business  processes  through  integra...
