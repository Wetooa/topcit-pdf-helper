# Programming Language & Software Development Guide

## 1. Programming Language Overview

### A. What is a Programming Language?
*   **Purpose:** Enables humans to communicate instructions to computers.
*   **How it works:** Programs written in a programming language are translated into **machine language** (0s and 1s) by a **compiler** or **interpreter** so computers can understand them.
*   **Importance:** Choosing the right language is crucial for productivity and quality, as each language has different uses.

### B. Types of Programming Languages

| Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Examples                                       |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Low-level Language** | - **Machine-centric:** Directly understood by the computer's hardware. <br/> - **Fast execution.** <br/> - **Machine-specific:** Code differs for each computer model, lacking compatibility. <br/> - **Difficult for humans** to write directly.                                                                    | - **Machine language:** Pure binary (0s and 1s). <br/> - **Assembly language:** Simple characters representing machine language instructions. |
| **High-level Language** | - **Human-centric:** Similar to natural human language, making it easy to read and write programs. <br/> - **Highly readable and productive.** <br/> - **Machine-independent:** Programs can be written once and run on different machines after translation by a compiler or interpreter. <br/> - Created to simplify programming for humans. | FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, C, C++, Java, Python |

### C. Programming Language Use Cases

| Area of Use                      | Major Languages             |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Science and Technology (numerical) | FORTRAN, ALGOL60            |
| Business                         | COBOL                       |
| Artificial Intelligence (AI)     | LISP, PROLOG                |
| System Programming               | PL/S, BLISS, ALGOL, C/C++, Java, Python |
| Special Purposes                 | GPSS (for simulation)       |

### D. Interpreters vs. Compilers

**1. Interpreter Languages**
*   **Process:** Convert source code into a low-level language directly and execute it immediately, without creating a separate executable file.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Programs execute *as needed*, without waiting for complete translation.
    *   Saves memory as the original source code form is maintained.
*   **Shortcomings:**
    *   **Slower for repeated execution** because the source program must be decoded *every time* it runs.
*   **Examples:** LISP, PROLOG, Python, JavaScript.

**2. Compiler Languages**
*   **Process:** Translate high-level source code into a machine language "object module" (executable file) first. This module is then linked, loaded, and executed.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Translated object codes can be saved and reused.
    *   Once compiled, programs execute **very quickly**.
*   **Shortcomings:**
    *   **Compilation process takes time.**
    *   Can sometimes waste memory as one line of source code might translate into many lines of machine code.
*   **Examples:** FORTRAN, PASCAL, C, C++.

## 2. Characteristics of Major Programming Languages

### A. C Language
*   **Origin:** Developed by Dennis Richie (1970s) at Bell Labs for the UNIX operating system.
*   **Influence:** Most computer languages are motivated by C. Many famous OS (iOS, Android) are written in C.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Fast execution and efficient memory management.
    *   Concise notation allows function implementation in structured blocks.
    *   **Procedure-oriented:** Programs execute in a specified sequence.
    *   **More difficult to use** than Java; requires careful consideration of arrays and memory.
    *   **Poor portability:** Difficult to port (move) programs when the execution environment or machine changes.

### B. C++ Language
*   **Origin:** Extends C, suitable for system programming.
*   **Key Feature:** Supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, making it suitable for large-scale software development. Improves reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Object-Orientation:** Supports classes, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
    *   **Encapsulation & Data Hiding:** Classes hide internal workings; users only interact with the class interface.
    *   **Inheritance & Reusability:** Allows creating new classes by extending common characteristics of existing ones, boosting software productivity.
    *   **Polymorphism:** The ability for one name to have multiple forms or behaviors (e.g., a "person" can be an "office worker" and an "instructor").

### C. Java Language
*   **Origin:** Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1991) for home appliances. Gained popularity on the internet with "applets."
*   **Current Use:** Most popular and widely used language for web apps, mobile devices (Android), and home appliances.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Syntax similar to C/C++.
    *   Simplified complexity compared to C++.
    *   **Automatic garbage collection:** Manages memory automatically.
    *   **Perfect Object-Oriented Language:** Fully applies OOP concepts.
    *   **Platform-independent:** Java programs run on any device with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

### D. Python Language
*   **Origin:** Developed by Guido Van Rossum (1990).
*   **Type:** Interpreter, object-oriented, conversational language.
*   **Use Cases:** Web programming (Django), big data analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Dynamic typing:** Data types are checked at runtime, not compile-time.
    *   **Easy grammar:** Similar to English sentences, making it highly readable and easy to learn.
    *   Good for asynchronous coding using a single event loop.
    *   **Multi-paradigm:** Supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming styles.

### E. JavaScript Language
*   **Origin:** Object-based script programming language.
*   **Primary Use:** Web browsers (client-side scripting), but also server-side (Node.js).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Simple programming, but can have security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Highly scalable and usable:** Due to its open-source nature and active developer community.
    *   **Easy to learn:** No separate compilation process is required (interpreted).
    *   Extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (AngularJS, D3.js, Node.js, React).

## 3. Software Development Framework

### A. Concept of a Software Development Framework
*   **Definition:** A collection of code libraries, interface protocols, and configuration information that provides a **basic structure** for software composition.
*   **Purpose:** To develop information systems efficiently and easily.
*   **Key Idea: Inversion of Control (IoC):** The framework controls the flow of the application, and developers extend it by adding their specific business logic.
*   **How it helps:** Instead of building software from scratch, frameworks provide pre-built structured tools and libraries for common tasks (e.g., displaying data, handling input, integrating with external modules).

### B. Advantages of Using a Framework

| Strength                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Improves Code Quality**      | Defines and handles common repetitive coding tasks, reducing the risk of bugs and ensuring more consistent, correct code.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Increases Development Productivity** | Provides various pre-built functions and components (e.g., communication methods, data handling, user interface elements), allowing developers to focus on unique features rather than reinventing common solutions. This saves time and effort. |
| **Standardization & Risk Reduction** | Standardizes development practices, guarantees a certain level of quality, and reduces the risks associated with new software development by using proven technologies and structures. |

01 Programming Language  Overview
A) Concept  of the programming  language
A programming  language  enables  users to write a program  using a familiar  language,  that is, a language  that is
similar to the language  they use every day. In other words, programming  languages should be used to enable
humans  to communicate  with computers.  Thus, programs  written  in each programming  language  are translated
into machine  language  using a compiler  or an interpreter,  so that computers  can understand  the languages.
In addition,  it is necessary  to secure the productivity  and quality  goals using a proper programming  language  in
each area, because  each programming  language  has different  uses.
<Table 21> Low-level  language  and high-level  language
Item Description Representative  language
Low-level  languageMachine-centric  language  that is executed  quickly  and has a
different  code for each machine.
There is a machine  language  composed  of a binary system
that is easily understood  by the computer,  and an assembly
language  that corresponds  to the machine  language.
There is no compatibility  between  computer  models.Machine  language,
assembly  language
High-level  languageIt is easy to write a program  that is highly readable  and
productive  compared  to low-level  language  because  it is made
so as to be similar  to natural language,  which can be easily
understood  by humans.
A program  can be written independently  of the machine  and
converted  into low-level  language  by a compiler  or interpreter.FORTRAN,  COBOL,  BASIC, C, C,
Java, Python
The machine  language  is written in only 0 and 1 and can be directly understood  by hardware,  whereas  the
assembly language  expresses  the machine  language  in simple characters.  Both the machine language  and
assembly  language  are referred  to as a “low-level  language’.  However,  as it is practically  difficult for humans  to
manually  write programs  in either machine  language  or assembly  language,  high-level  languages  were created
to resolve this problem.  High-level  languages,  represented  by C, C++, Java, and Python, enable us to write
programs  using everyday  languages  and symbols.

B) Interpreter  languages
Interpreter  languages  convert  a source program into a low-level  language  directly, without  requiring  any
intermediate  steps, and execute  the program at the same time. Machine  language  programs  are not created
by translating  high-level  languages  into intermediate  codes and then executing  the translated  codes with a
software  interpreter;  rather, such programs  are executed  by calling sub-routines  corresponding  to the functions
of each intermediate  code. LISP and PROLOG  are representative  interpreter  languages.

@ Strengths  of interpreter  languages
+ Programs  are executed  if needed,  without  waiting  for complete  machine  language  translation.
+ Memory  can be saved as the source language  form is maintained  until the program  has been fully executed.
@ Shortcomings  of interpreter  languages
+ The source program  has to be decoded  whenever  it is executed  again, which takes time.
C) Compiler  languages
“Compilation”  means  converting  a specific  language  into another  language  having an equivalent  meaning.
The compiler  translates  a high-level  language  into a machine  language,  which is a low-level  language,  in order
to make an object module,  after which this module is linked, loaded, and executed.  FORTRAN,  PASCAL,  and C/
C are representative  compiler  languages.
