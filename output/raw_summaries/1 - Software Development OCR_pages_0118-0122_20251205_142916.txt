## Software Configuration Management (SCM) Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to Software Configuration Management (SCM)

*   **Importance & Trends:**
    *   SCM is increasingly recognized as crucial for **software quality**.
    *   It's vital for **large-scale projects** and those in **distributed computing environments**.
    *   **CASE tools** (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) are important for SCM.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Understand SCM concepts and activities.
    *   Learn to use SCM tools.
*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Software Configuration:** Programs, documents, data developed during a project.
    *   **SCM Elements:** Components managed by SCM.
    *   **Change Control Procedure:** Steps for managing modifications.
    *   **Version Management Tool:** Software to track changes over time.
    *   **Configuration Management Tool:** Software to manage and control configurations.

### 2. Why SCM is Essential: Problems Without It

**(Summarized from a case study)**
Failing to implement SCM can lead to severe project issues, such as:

*   **Lack of Centralized Management:**
    *   Source code and project deliverables scattered across individual developer PCs.
    *   Only some documents managed centrally, leading to inconsistencies.
*   **Poor Documentation & Knowledge Loss:**
    *   No proper records, making it impossible to onboard new team members or understand past work when someone leaves.
*   **Data Loss & Rework:**
    *   Critical project files (e.g., source code) can be lost due to technical issues (e.g., virus infection) without backups or version control, leading to extensive rework.
*   **Inability to Track Changes & Versions:**
    *   Difficulty managing different software versions for various customers.
    *   Frequent "patching" leads to new bugs and makes issue tracking impossible.
*   **Lack of Control & Traceability:**
    *   No systematic way to manage change requests or trace how requirements were implemented.
*   **Impact on Trust:**
    *   Project delays and quality issues erode customer trust.

**Conclusion:** Implementing a basic software development process with a robust configuration management plan from the start is critical to prevent such failures and ensure project success.

### 3. What is Software Configuration Management (SCM)?

*   **Definition:**
    *   SCM is a set of activities designed to **manage software changes** throughout the entire software development lifecycle and into the maintenance phase.
    *   It involves:
        *   Identifying and controlling causes of changes.
        *   Ensuring changes are properly implemented.
        *   Notifying relevant stakeholders of change outcomes.
    *   **Goal:** Reduce overall software development costs and minimize risk factors.
*   **"Configuration" Explained:**
    *   Refers to all products created during software development, including:
        *   Programs (source code, executables)
        *   Program description documents (requirements, design, test plans)
        *   Data
    *   SCM systematically manages the **history of all component changes** from development through maintenance.
*   **Reasons SCM is Necessary (Challenges without SCM):**
    *   **Lack of Visibility:** Software is intangible, making its state hard to see.
    *   **Difficulty in Control:** The invisibility of software makes it hard to manage development.
    *   **Lack of Traceability:** Hard to track the entire development process.
    *   **Lack of Monitoring:** Continuous project management is difficult without visibility and tracking.
    *   **Ceaseless Change:** User requirements are constantly evolving, demanding flexible management.

### 4. SCM Conceptual Overview

SCM involves a continuous cycle of activities:

1.  **Identify Configuration:** Determine what needs to be managed.
2.  **Control Configuration:** Regulate changes to identified items.
3.  **Approve and Check Changes:** Review proposed modifications.
4.  **Allow Changes:** Authorize the implementation of changes.
5.  **Apply Changes:** Implement the approved modifications.
6.  **Record Configuration:** Document the changes and current state.
7.  **Audit Configuration:** Verify the integrity and correctness of the configuration.
8.  **Library Management:** Manage the storage and retrieval of configuration items.

### 5. Core Components of SCM

*   **Baseline:**
    *   A technical control point for configuration items.
    *   A designated, formally reviewed and agreed-upon point in time (e.g., a specific release version) that controls all subsequent changes.
*   **Configuration Item (CI):**
    *   A fundamental target formally defined and described in the software life cycle.
    *   Any piece of information or software that needs to be controlled (e.g., a specific source code file, a design document, a test script).
*   **Configuration Product:**
    *   The tangible, realized output formally implemented in the software development life cycle.
    *   Examples: Technical documents, hardware products, software products (executables).
*   **Configuration Information:**
    *   The combination of a **configuration item** and its corresponding **configuration product**.

### 6. Key Activities in SCM

SCM activities are divided into four main areas:

1.  **Configuration Identification:**
    *   **Purpose:** To define a clear and predictable document structure, facilitate tracking, and record information.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Identifying and numbering all configuration management targets (e.g., specific files, modules).
        *   Defining what constitutes a "product," "document," and assigning unique "configuration item numbers."
2.  **Configuration Control:**
    *   **Purpose:** To manage changes to baselines and ensure consistency.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Reviewing and approving software configuration change requests.
        *   Controlling how changes are reflected in defined baselines.
        *   Managing the change request process.
        *   Supporting the operation of the SCM organization.
3.  **Configuration Audit:**
    *   **Purpose:** To determine the integrity of the software baseline and verify compliance.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Ensuring the software baseline is successfully established and accurate.
        *   Checking if changes to the baseline match specified requirements.
        *   Performing verification and validation activities.
4.  **Configuration Recording:**
    *   **Purpose:** To maintain a complete history of configuration changes and statuses.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Recording the various statuses and execution results of software configurations and change management activities.
        *   Managing a database of this information.
        *   Creating reports to provide insights into configuration history.

### 7. Benefits of SCM

Applying SCM activities to software development leads to:

*   **Improved Quality:** By systematically managing changes and versions, SCM reduces errors and inconsistencies.
*   **Reduced Costs & Risks:** Minimizes rework, prevents data loss, and helps identify issues early.
*   **Enhanced Control:** Provides clear oversight over all software assets and their evolution.
*   **Systematic Change Management:** Allows for a structured and traceable response to evolving user requirements.
*   **Increased Traceability:** Makes it possible to track the history of every component and change.
*   **Better Collaboration:** Facilitates teamwork by providing a shared, managed repository of assets.

The story of a development  team:
A certain project was commenced  with a deadline  of about three months,  but its
end was not visible even after two and a half months. Mr. Ko, the project manager,
also in charge of the architecture,  became increasingly  anxious with every passing
day. When the project was started, he thought  that three months  would be enough,
given its scale. That is why he didn’t create a separate  management  system -
because  four members  seemed few enough to engage in face-to-face  communication.
However,  about a month later he began to feel that the project had gradually  got
bogged down. Suddenly,  a team member  left the company  for health reasons and all
his tasks were stopped.  Mr. Ko hastened  to look for a replacement  to fill the position.
However,  the departed  member  had not created any proper documents,  so Mr. Ko
had to select one member  of his small team to train the new recruit for three days.
After that happened,  he hurriedly  began to list up the most immediate  requirements  and
the design deliverables.  Of course, listing those deliverables  was not included  in the project
period, so he had to work overnight  for almost a week to avoid delaying  the project.
After that, the project seemed to go well to some degree. However,  more serious
problems  occurred  after about two months.  After developing  the major functions  and
frameworks,  Mr. Ko was busy preparing  for a demonstration  for customers  because  it was
due soon. However,  his team was unlucky.  A team member's  computer  became infected
with a virus, and all the source codes and various scripts were erased in an instant.
The source of the calamity  was the method of deliverables  management.  That
is, the deliverables  were not centrally  managed.  Instead, only documents  were
managed  on the central file server, and the source code of each member  was
stored in the team’s PCs during development.  Until that happened,  each developer
was trusted to upload their source codes to the file server. The developer  who
lost all his source codes due to  a virus infection  was the least diligent  of them.
The team members  had to work overnight  again for couple of days to update
the latest source code uploaded  to the file server. During that period, the
customers’  trust was wearing  thinner and thinner. When the developed
system began to be delivered  to the customers,  they made various requests,
and the development  team began to modify the source code on demand.

Software  Development )
However,  the software  version of each customer  varied as time went by. In the end, the development
team was unable to track the customers’  requirements  and software  versions.  The source code was
patched  frequently,  and bugs that did not exist before began to appear  one by one. The team had to
perform  tedious  debugging  for each source code line almost every day.
If they had known and utilized such concepts  as branching  and merging  of configuration  management,
baseline,  baseline  promotion,  change tracking,  and configuration  audit, they would not have struggled  with
new bugs that appeared  every day by systematically  responding  to requests  for changes.
Further  efforts are required  to fully understand  and utilize these concepts,  but the effect is certainly  worth it.
If you have ever managed  to complete  a software  development  project without configuration
management,  you must be very lucky. However,  | think all of us must have experienced  this difficulty
at least once or twice. What if Mr Ko’s team had only started the project after establishing  a software
development  process, even though it was simple, and established  a configuration  management  plan
according  to the situation?  It is quite probable  that a ridiculous  thing like this would never have happened.
In conclusion,  configuration  management  surely helps software  development.  It takes more activities
to understand  ...
