## Learning Guide: IT Business, Ethics & Personal Information Protection

This guide summarizes key aspects of personal information protection, focusing on Korean regulations and international guidelines.

### 1. The Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) - Korea

The **Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)** is the primary law governing personal information.

#### 1.1. Basic Principles

*   **Scope:** Applies to all personal information processors in public and private sectors.
*   **Information Covered:** Includes physical documents (handwritten) and electronically processed data.
*   **Processing Rule:** Generally prohibited without the data subject's consent or a legal basis.
*   **Unique Identification Information (e.g., resident registration number):** Requires specific safety measures like **encryption** to prevent loss, theft, or damage.
*   **Data Breach Notification:** Mandatory to notify individuals of personal information leakage.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Includes a group dispute mediation system and group lawsuits.
*   **Oversight:** Presidential Personal Information Protection Committee.

#### 1.2. Personal Information Processing Procedure & Obligations

Companies and public institutions must follow specific rules at each stage of processing personal information:

1.  **Collection & Use:**
    *   Collect only the **minimum necessary** personal information.
    *   Strict restrictions on collecting **sensitive information** and **unique identification information**.
    *   Provide alternative sign-up methods (e.g., without using a resident registration number).
    *   Install and operate **image data processing equipment** (e.g., CCTV) with disclosed management policies.
    *   Designate **Personal Information Protection Managers**.
    *   Implement **safety measures** for personal information.

2.  **Provision to Third Parties / Outsourcing:**
    *   Limit provision for purposes other than the original intended one.
    *   Specific rules apply when outsourcing personal information processing or transferring data due to business transfer.

3.  **Destruction:**
    *   Personal information must be destroyed when no longer needed.

4.  **Data Breach:**
    *   Mandatory notification and reporting of personal information leakage or damage.

5.  **Guarantee of Rights:**
    *   Individuals have the right to access their personal information.
    *   Right to request correction, deletion, or destruction of their personal information.
    *   Supported by the Personal Information Dispute Mediation Committee and class-action lawsuits.

6.  **Penalty & Transition Measures:**
    *   Legal penalties for non-compliance.

### 2. Privacy Policy Guidelines: Key Steps & Consent

Organizations must develop privacy policies that are clear and transparent to users.

#### 2.1. Preparation Stage for Policy Development

1.  **Identify Required Information:**
    *   Determine the **minimum personal information** needed for a task (e.g., name, phone number).
    *   Check for **unique identification information** (e.g., resident registration number, driver's license) or **sensitive information** (e.g., ideology, health, criminal history) as these require separate, stricter processing.
2.  **Identify Retention Period:**
    *   Confirm the legal or policy-defined retention period.
    *   Set the **minimum necessary retention period** if not specified by law.
3.  **Confirm Consent Requirements:**

    *   **Consent is generally required** to collect and use personal information.
    *   **Exceptions (when consent is NOT required):**
        *   Public institution's statutory duties.
        *   Existing special legal provisions or unavoidable legal obligations.
        *   Necessary to execute/perform a contract with the data subject.
        *   Urgent necessity to protect life, body, or property from imminent danger (and consent cannot be obtained).
        *   When justifiable interests of the controller outweigh data subject's rights.

    *   **Special Consent Rules:**
        *   **Sensitive Information or Unique Identification Information:** Requires **separate consent** from the data subject, unless statutes specifically require or permit processing.
        *   **Resident Registration Number:** Generally prohibited, except when specific laws require or permit it, or for urgent protection of life/property.
        *   **Children Under 14:** Requires consent from their **legal representative**.

4.  **Identify Third-Party Provision:**
    *   If personal information will be provided to a third party, **separate consent is required**.
    *   **Third-party provision checklist (must be provided to data subject):**
        1.  Recipient of personal information.
        2.  Purpose of use by the recipient.
        3.  Specific data to be provided.
        4.  Retention period by the recipient.
        5.  Right to deny consent and any resulting disadvantages.

### 3. Managing Personal Information Protection in Public Institutions

Public institutions undergo a national-level **Diagnosis of Personal Information Protection Management Levels**. This evaluates their management systems and infringement prevention activities, influencing institutional evaluations to encourage improvement.

#### 3.1. Key Diagnostic Areas & Indicators (Summary)

1.  **Laying the Foundation:**
    *   Dedicated organization and manpower for personal information protection.
    *   Budget allocation for protection activities.
2.  **Protection in Consignment Processing:**
    *   Understanding legal obligations for outsourced processing.
    *   Education and supervision for entrusted parties.
3.  **Establishment & Operation of Protection System:**
    *   Annual training plans and implementation for all staff (officers, handlers, general staff).
    *   Role of the Personal Information Protection Officer (management, supervision, improvement).
4.  **Establishment & Implementation of Protection Measures:**
    *   Collecting minimum necessary information and proper consent procedures.
    *   Procedures for using/providing information for non-intended purposes.
    *   Conducting **Personal Information Impact Assessments (PIA)** for new or modified systems that might infringe on privacy.
    *   Operating **Image Information Processing Devices** (e.g., CCTV) with disclosed policies and management registers.
    *   Measures to prevent leakage/exposure on webpages, systems, business computers, and mobile devices.
5.  **Establishment & Implementation of Infringement Countermeasures:**
    *   Procedures for responding to infringement incidents and emergencies.
    *   Policies for managing access rights to personal information processing systems and auditing access records.
    *   Understanding and encrypting unique identification information.

### 4. Key Definitions

*   **Sensitive Information:** A broad category of personal information requiring strict protection, including ideas, beliefs, trade union/political party membership, political opinions, health, sex life, genetic information, criminal history data.
*   **Unique Identification Information:** Information that uniquely identifies an individual, such as resident registration number, passport number, driver's license number, alien registration number.
*   **Personal Information Impact Assessment (PIA):** An evaluation system to analyze risk factors and derive improvements when new or modified personal information files might lead to infringement.
*   **Image Information Processing Device:** Devices (e.g., CCTV) installed in a space to record images of people or objects and transmit them. Operators must have and disclose a management policy.
    *   **Required items for Image Information Management Register:** Classification of use, provision, reading, destruction; date/time; file name/type; person in charge; purpose/reason; third party for data use/provision/reading; grounds for use/provision; type of use/provision; period.

### 5. Domestic Legal Landscape Comparison (Korea)

| Classification | Information & Communications Network Act (ICNA) | Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) |

### 6. International Guidelines: OECD Privacy Guidelines

The **OECD Privacy Guidelines** (officially, "Recommendation Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data") were established in 1980. They serve as a fundamental basis for personal information laws globally.

#### Key Principles:

*   **Collection Limitation Principle:**
    *   Limits on personal data collection.
    *   Data must be obtained lawfully and fairly, ideally with data subject consent.
