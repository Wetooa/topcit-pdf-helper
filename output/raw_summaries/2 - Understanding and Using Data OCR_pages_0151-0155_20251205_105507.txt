## NoSQL Databases: A Learning Guide

### 1. NoSQL: Definition & Core Characteristics

**Definition:**
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a non-relational, distributed data repository. Unlike traditional relational databases (RDBMS) that use tabular relations, NoSQL provides alternative processing methods. It's designed for handling unstructured and ultra-high-capacity data, focusing on high write speed and horizontal scalability.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Schema-less / Flexible Schema:** Data can be saved freely without a predefined fixed schema. Data is stored in simplified forms like key-value pairs, graphs, or documents.
*   **Massive Scalability (Elasticity):**
    *   Supports **scale-out** (adding more servers) using inexpensive commodity hardware.
    *   Allows easy expansion of system scale and performance.
    *   Distributes I/O load, enabling large-scale data creation, updates, and queries without downtime.
    *   **Partitioning** allows gradual node increase.
*   **High Availability:**
    *   Data is automatically divided and replicated across a cluster.
    *   No single point of failure; data remains available even if a node goes down.
*   **High Performance:**
    *   Achieved through memory-based caching, non-blocking writes, and low complexity algorithms.
    *   Quick response speeds, even for large-scale queries.
*   **Simplified Interface:**
    *   No complex query language like SQL.
    *   Provides a simple API or HTTP interface.
*   **Flexible Integrity:**
    *   Doesn't prioritize strict ACID properties (like RDBMS).
    *   Allows the application to manage some data integrity, providing "as much integrity as needed."
*   **Atomicity:** Each write operation is atomic (indivisible).
*   **Consistency:** Strong consistency is not always required; eventual consistency is often sufficient.
*   **Persistence:** Data is stored reliably on disk, not just volatile memory.
*   **Deployment Flexibility:**
    *   Automatic data loading when nodes are added/deleted.
    *   No constraints on distributed file systems, shared storage, or special hardware.
    *   Operable in heterogeneous hardware environments.
*   **Modeling Flexibility:** Conveniently models various data types (key-value, hierarchical, graphs).
*   **Query Flexibility:** Supports various queries like multiple GETs for key sets or range-based queries.

### 2. BASE Attributes of NoSQL

NoSQL databases often prioritize BASE attributes over ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) found in RDBMS.

**BASE stands for:**

*   **B**asically **A**vailable:
    *   Emphasizes availability, even with multiple failures.
    *   Copies of data are stored in multiple locations.
    *   Ensures the system remains operational.
*   **S**oft state:
    *   Node status is determined by external information.
    *   State can change over time even without input due to eventual consistency.
*   **E**ventually **C**onsistent:
    *   Consistency is maintained optimally, even if temporarily lost.
    *   Updates between distributed nodes are propagated over time; eventually, all nodes will reflect the same data.

**Comparison of BASE vs. ACID Attributes:**

| Attribute           | BASE (NoSQL)                  | ACID (RDBMS)                  |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Application Field** | NoSQL                         | RDBMS                         |
| **Scope**           | Characteristics of entire system | Limited to individual transactions |
| **Consistency**     | Weak/Eventual consistency     | Strong/Immediate consistency  |
| **Main Focus**      | Availability                  | Commit (data integrity)       |
| **System Aspect**   | Performance                   | Strict data management        |
| **Efficiency Focus** | Query design                  | Table design                  |

### 3. NoSQL Storage Methods (Types of NoSQL)

NoSQL databases are categorized by their data models:

1.  **Key-value based:**
    *   Most basic NoSQL type.
    *   Stores data as simple key-value pairs.
    *   Provides fast Get, Put, and Delete functions.
    *   *Examples:* Dynamo, Redis, MemcacheDB.
2.  **Column-family based:**
    *   Stores data in rows within "column families" (similar to tables).
    *   Highly scalable for wide-column data.
    *   *Examples:* Cassandra, HBase, SimpleDB.
3.  **Document based:**
    *   Stores "documents" (like XML, JSON, BSON) as values in a key-value store.
    *   Documents are self-describing and hierarchical.
    *   *Examples:* MongoDB, CouchDB.
4.  **Graph based:**
    *   Expresses relational database entities as "nodes" and relationships as "edges" between nodes.
    *   Ideal for highly connected data (social networks, recommendation engines).
    *   *Examples:* Neo4J, Flock DB.

### 4. NoSQL Data Modeling vs. Relational DB

| Feature            | Relational DB Data Modeling            | NoSQL Data Modeling                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Key Point**      | ACID-based data modeling               | BASE-based data modeling              |
| **Consistency**    | Secures data consistency with minimal redundancy | Fast performance through data replication |
| **Phase**          | Development after data modeling (design based on business needs) | Data set designed considering screen and development logic (more agile) |
| **Independence**   | Independent program design (data independence) | Dependent program design (avoids data independence for performance) |
| **Characteristics** | Derives logical connection points using generalized notation | Closer to file structural design; creates data sets easily processed by programs |

### 5. The CAP Theorem

**Definition:**
The CAP theorem states that it's impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously satisfy all three properties: **C**onsistency, **A**vailability, and **P**artition Tolerance. You must strategically choose only two.

**Components:**

*   **Consistency (C):** All nodes show the same data at the same time. Every user always views the same, most recent data.
*   **Availability (A):** Even if some nodes fail, the system remains operational, and all users can always read and write data.
*   **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate normally even if there are network failures (message loss) separating parts of the system (partitions).

**Management Strategies (Choosing Two):**

*   **C + A (Consistency + Availability):**
    *   Highly reliable, prevents message loss.
    *   Essential when transactions require strong consistency.
    *   *Typically found in:* General RDBMS (though RDBMS are usually not distributed in a way that prioritizes P).
*   **C + P (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**
    *   Prioritizes consistency even during network partitions.
    *   If a partition occurs, availability might be sacrificed (some nodes might become unavailable to maintain consistency).
    *   *Typically found in:* Google's BigTable, HyperTable, HBase.
*   **A + P (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**
    *   Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance.
    *   If a partition occurs, consistency might be sacrificed (different nodes might show slightly different data temporarily) until the partition is resolved and data syncs.
    *   Essential for asynchronous store operations.
    *   *Typically found in:* Dynamo, Apache Cassandra, CouchDB, Oracle Coherence.

**Note:** NoSQL systems are often composed of distributed systems that exhibit characteristics of A+P and C+P, usually leaning heavily towards A+P to ensure high availability and scalability.

fails partially.
NoSQL  provides  query language,  related processing  technology,  and API that can efficiently  search
Query and process  data according  to the characteristics  of data even in a system composed  of tens or
thousands  of servers.
NoSQL  has a structure  in which memory-based  caching  technology  is very important,  and which can

to development  and operation.
High scalability Partitioning  allows a gradual  node increase.

Atomicity Each write operation  needs to be atomic.
Consistency Strong consistency  is not needed, but the resulting  consistency  is sufficient  (Read-Your-Writes).

conveniently.
