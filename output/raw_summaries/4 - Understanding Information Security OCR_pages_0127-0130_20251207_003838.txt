# Wireless LAN Security: Threats & IEEE 802.11i Standard

This guide covers common wireless LAN (WLAN) security threats and the IEEE 802.11i standard designed to address them.

## 1. Wireless LAN Security Threats

WLANs face three main types of security threats:

### 1.1 Technical Security Threats
These involve direct attacks leveraging wireless technology vulnerabilities.

*   **Types of Attacks:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Collecting sensitive user data via radio waves.
    *   **Illegal Access:** Unauthorized entry, including Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **Jamming:** Interfering with radio signals to disrupt service.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading the network (e.g., with large packet transmissions).
    *   **Hacking Weak Settings:** Exploiting outdated or insecure protocols like WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) for unauthorized access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use strong built-in AP security features like **WPA2** (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2).
    *   For critical environments (e.g., corporate), implement professional systems like **WIPS** (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System).

### 1.2 Administrative Security Threats
These arise from human error or poor management practices, even with strong technical security.

*   **Causes:**
    *   Insufficient management of WLAN equipment and devices.
    *   Lack of user security awareness, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   Poor radio wave management, allowing unauthorized access to internal or external APs.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Establish and implement clear management plans for all WLAN devices (e.g., APs, user terminals).
    *   Periodically raise user security awareness through training.
    *   Regularly check for illegal internal and external network accesses.

### 1.3 Physical Security Threats
These relate to the physical vulnerability of wireless hardware.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Wireless APs are often exposed (unlike wired network devices) and susceptible to:
        *   **Theft or Damage:** Physical harm to the device.
        *   **Power Shutdown/Cable Disconnection:** Disrupting service.
    *   **Device Loss:** If a device with stored WLAN access or security settings is lost, unauthorized persons can gain access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure wireless APs are not exposed and are physically secured.
    *   Periodically change security settings.
    *   Devise methods for managing WLAN devices and implementing loss prevention plans.

## 2. IEEE 802.11i Standard

### 2.1 Introduction & Purpose
*   **Problem:** The initial IEEE 802.11 security standard, **WEP**, was found to be highly vulnerable to attacks (e.g., brute force).
*   **Solution:** The **IEEE 802.11i** working group developed this standard to address WEP's weaknesses and provide robust wireless LAN security.
*   **Key Goals:** Protect users by defining:
    *   User **authentication**.
    *   Secure **key exchange**.
    *   Advanced wireless section **encryption algorithms**.

### 2.2 Core Functions
IEEE 802.11i achieves its goals through essential functions:
*   **Authentication:** Uses **IEEE 802.1X** for strong user verification.
*   **Key Exchange:** Employs a **4-way handshake** protocol to securely establish cryptographic keys.
*   **Encryption:** Utilizes advanced algorithms like **CCMP** (Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol).

### 2.3 Key Components and Services
The 802.11i standard defines the following services and uses specific protocols/algorithms:

*   **Robust Security Network (RSN):** The overall framework for secure WLANs.
*   **Core Services:**
    *   **Authentication:** User and Authentication Server (AS) verify each other, generating a temporary key for client-AP communication.
    *   **Access Control:** Manages message routing and key exchange, often integrating with other authentication protocols.
    *   **Privacy through Message Integrity:** Encrypts MAC layer data and includes an integrity code to prevent data tampering.
*   **Key Protocols and Algorithms:**
    *   **IEEE 802.1X:** Port-based network access control for authentication.
    *   **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol):** A framework for various authentication methods.
    *   **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol):** An interim security protocol used with WPA/WPA2 before CCMP became widely adopted.
    *   **CCMP (Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol):** The stronger encryption algorithm using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
    *   **CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code):** Provides message integrity.

### 2.4 IEEE 802.11i Operation Steps

The secure connection process in IEEE 802.11i typically follows five steps:

1.  **Discovery (Search):**
    *   A **STA** (Station, e.g., a laptop) searches for a desired WLAN **AP** (Access Point).
    *   The AP broadcasts its security policies, allowing the STA to identify and prepare to establish a **Security Association (SA)**.

2.  **Authentication:**
    *   The STA and the **AS** (Authentication Server) mutually authenticate each other.
    *   The AP acts as a relay, simply transferring communication data between the STA and AS during this phase.

3.  **Key Generation and Distribution (Key Management):**
    *   The AS transfers a **PMK** (Pairwise Master Key) to the AP (often using **RADIUS** - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Services).
    *   The AP and STA then exchange messages (using 802.1X) to derive and share a unique cryptographic key for their session.

4.  **Secure Data Transmission (Protected Data Transfer):**
    *   The STA and the end station securely exchange data frames via the AP.
    *   All data transmitted between the STA and the AP is now encrypted and integrity-protected using the established cryptographic key.

5.  **Disconnection (Connection Termination):**
    *   The secure connection between the AP and the STA is released through message exchange.
    *   The original (unsecured) connection state is restored.

Information  security )
® Technical  security  threats
+ There are various  types of attacks  in the technical  security  threat of the wireless  LAN, including  the leakage
of important  user information  through radio wave collection,  illegal access, and man in the middle attack:
jamming,  denial of service attack using large packet transmission,  and hacking  weak security  settings,  such
as WEP (Wired Equivalent  Privacy)  to illegally  access  and infiltrate into the internal network.
+ Most technical  security  threats to wireless  LAN can be blocked by setting security  features  provided  by the
wireless  AP (Access  Point), such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected  Access2).  However,  when using a wireless  LAN in
a place where important  information  is handled,  such as in a corporate  environment,  a professional  wireless
security  system,  such as WIPS (Wireless  Intrusion  Prevention  System)  must be introduced.
@ Administrative  security  threats
+ A strong security  technology  can be easily bypassed  if the threat is not properly  managed,  even though the
technology  is applied to the wireless  LAN. Administrative  security  threats include insufficient  management
of wireless LAN equipment  and devices, intrusion,  due to a lack of user security  awareness,  and allowing
outsiders to  access internal APs and insiders to access external  Aps, due to insufficient  radio wave
management.
+ To respond  to the administrative security  threat of wireless  LAN, management  plans for access devices and
terminals,  such as Aps, should be established  and implemented,  user awareness  should be raised periodically,
training  should be implemented,  and illegal internal  and external  accesses  should be checked.
© Physical  security  threats
+ Most network  devices  in the wired LAN environment  are installed  and managed  in a place that is difficult  to
access by general users. On the contrary,  most of the wireless  AP are exposed  and installed  outside  because
radio waves should be transmitted.  In this case, the wireless  AP is exposed  to risks, such as theft and
damage,  power shutdown,  LAN cable separation,  etc., so service  failure may occur. Also, if the wireless  device
is lost and stored WLAN access information  and security  setting information  is leaked, unauthorized  persons
can access  the wireless  LAN.
+ To prepare  for such a threat, it should be ensured  that the wireless  AP is not exposed  to the outside,  setting
information  should be changed  periodically,  and a method of managing  devices that use the WLAN, along
with a loss prevention  plan, should be devised.
C) Wireless  LAN security
@ IEEE 802.11i services
WEP was developed  to reinforce  the security  functions  of IEEE 802.11 (wireless  LAN standard).
However,  it is exposed  to various  attack techniques,  such as the brute force attack, due to insufficient  security
features.  Accordingly,  the 802.111 working  group has developed  various  functions  to solve the security  problem
of the wireless  LAN.
To protect  wireless  LAN users, the IEEE 802.11i standard  defines user authentication,  key exchange,  and
advanced  wireless  section encryption  algorithms.  It also satisfies  standardization  goals by implementing  IEEE

encryption  algorithm,  as essential  functions.
@ IEEE 802.11i components
The security  standard  of IEEE 802.11i defines the following  services.  [Figure 68] shows the structure  of the
security  protocol  and encryption  protocol  used to provide  these services.
+ Authentication:  The user and the authentication  server (AS) should authenticate  with each other using the
protocol,  and a temporary  key, to be used between  the client and the AP on the wireless link, should be
generated.
+ Access control: Proper message  routing and key exchange should be performed  using the authentication
function.  This function  can be performed  together  with various  authentication  protocols.
+ Privacy through  message  integrity:  MAC layer data is encrypted  together  with message  integrity  code, to
guarantee  that it is not been tampered  with.
