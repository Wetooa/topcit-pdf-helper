### **VIII. Project Process and Management**

#### **1. Project Life Cycle**
*   **Project Life Cycle (PLC):** The series of phases a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. Common phases include:
    1.  **Initiation:** Defining the project, getting authorization.
    2.  **Planning:** Developing the project management plan.
    3.  **Execution:** Carrying out the work defined in the plan.
    4.  **Monitoring & Controlling:** Tracking progress, managing changes, ensuring objectives are met.
    5.  **Closure:** Formalizing acceptance, ending the project.
*   **Project Planning and Executing:**
    *   **Planning:** Involves defining objectives, tasks, resources, schedule, budget, and risk responses. It's about *how* the project will be done.
    *   **Executing:** Involves carrying out the planned activities, managing resources, and producing deliverables. It's about *doing* the work.

#### **2. Project Management Methodology**
*   **Project Management Methodology:** A system of principles, techniques, and procedures used to manage a project. It provides a structured approach for project teams.
*   **Agile Methodology:** An iterative and incremental approach to project management, particularly common in software development.
    *   **Key Principles:** Responding to change over following a plan, individuals and interactions over processes and tools, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, working software over comprehensive documentation.
    *   **Focus:** Delivering value quickly and continuously, adapting to evolving requirements.
*   **Project Management Area:** Often refers to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) areas, such as Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Risk, Procurement, and Stakeholder Management.

---

### **IX. Scope Management**

#### **1. Concept and Process of Scope Management**

*   **Scope Management Process:**
    1.  **Plan Scope Management:** Documenting how scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
    2.  **Collect Requirements:** Defining and documenting stakeholder needs and expectations.
    3.  **Define Scope:** Developing a detailed description of the project and product.
    4.  **Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposing project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components.
    5.  **Validate Scope:** Formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables.
    6.  **Control Scope:** Monitoring the status of the project and product scope, managing changes to the scope baseline.

#### **2. Scope Management Technique**

    1.  **Plan Schedule Management:** Establishing policies, procedures, and documentation for planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule.
    2.  **Define Activities:** Identifying the specific actions to be performed to produce project deliverables.
    3.  **Sequence Activities:** Identifying and documenting relationships among project activities.
    4.  **Estimate Activity Durations:** Estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual activities.
    5.  **Develop Schedule:** Analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints to create the project schedule model.
    6.  **Control Schedule:** Monitoring the status of project activities to update project progress and manage changes to the schedule baseline.

#### **2. Schedule Management Technique**
*   **Critical Path Method (CPM):** A schedule development technique used to determine the longest path of planned activities to the end of the project, and the earliest and latest possible finish times for activities without delaying the project.
    *   **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that determines the shortest possible duration to complete the project. Any delay on a critical path activity will delay the entire project.
*   **Critical Chain Method (CCM):** A schedule development technique that accounts for limited resources by adding "buffers" to activities and the project completion, focusing on managing these buffers to complete the project on time. It emphasizes resource availability over fixed dates.
*   **Schedule Compression Techniques:** Methods to shorten the project schedule duration without reducing the project scope.
    *   **Crashing:** Shortening the schedule by adding resources to critical path activities, often at an increased cost.
    *   **Fast Tracking:** Performing activities in parallel that would normally be done in sequence. This can increase risk.

### **XI. Cost Management**

#### **1. Concept of Cost Management**
*   **Concept of Cost:** The monetary value of resources consumed to complete project activities or produce deliverables (e.g., labor, materials, equipment).
*   **Importance of Cost Management:** Ensures the project is completed within the approved budget, preventing overruns and ensuring efficient resource utilization.
*   **Concept of Cost Management:** The processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.

#### **2. Cost Management Process**
*   **Cost Management Planning:** Defining how project costs will be planned, estimated, budgeted, managed, and controlled.
*   **Cost Estimation:** Developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete project activities.
*   **Budgeting:** Aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline.
*   **Cost Control:** Monitoring project status to update project costs and managing changes to the cost baseline.

#### **3. Cost Estimation Techniques**
*   **Function Point (FP):** A method for estimating the size of a software system based on the number and complexity of its functional requirements, rather than lines of code.
*   **Man/Month (MM):** A unit of effort representing the amount of work one person can do in one month. Used to estimate effort, which then translates to cost.
*   **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model):** A procedural software cost estimation model that estimates software development effort, schedule, and cost based on inputs like project size and attributes.
*   **COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model II):** An updated version of COCOMO, designed to address modern software development practices (e.g., object-oriented development, reuse, agile).

#### **4. Cost Management Technique - Earned Value Management (EVM)**
*   **Concept of Earned Value:** A project performance management technique that integrates scope, schedule, and cost data.
    *   **Planned Value (PV):** The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. (How much work *should* have been done by a certain point).
    *   **Earned Value (EV):** The value of the work actually performed. (How much work *has* been done).
    *   **Actual Cost (AC):** The total cost incurred for the work performed. (How much it *cost* to do the work).
*   **Earned Value Management (EVM):** Uses PV, EV, and AC to calculate variances and performance indices, indicating project health (e.g., Cost Variance, Schedule Variance, Cost Performance Index, Schedule Performance Index).
