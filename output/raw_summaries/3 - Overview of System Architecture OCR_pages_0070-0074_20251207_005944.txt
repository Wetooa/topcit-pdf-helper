## Learning Guide: System Architecture & Latest Technologies

### 1. Locality

**Concept:** Programs tend to access specific areas of memory intensively, rather than uniformly. This tendency helps optimize memory access.

*   **Temporal Locality:** Data or programs recently accessed are likely to be accessed again in the near future. (e.g., a loop variable)
*   **Spatial Locality:** Data stored adjacent to recently accessed data is likely to be accessed continuously. (e.g., elements in an array)
*   **Sequential Locality:** Instructions are typically fetched and executed in order, unless a branch occurs. (about 80% of the time)

### 2. I/O Devices

**A) Concept of I/O Device**
I/O devices are essential for:
*   **Input:** Storing data from external sources into memory for CPU processing.
*   **Output:** Transferring processing results from main memory to an external medium.

**B) I/O Controller Structure and Addressing Methods**
An **I/O controller** is a dedicated circuit that manages communication between the CPU/memory and I/O devices.

*   **Roles of an I/O Controller:**
    *   Control and coordinate timing for I/O devices.
    *   Communicate with the CPU.
    *   Communicate with the I/O device itself.
    *   Buffer data (temporary storage).
    *   Detect errors.

*   **I/O Addressing Methods:** Each I/O device needs two addresses (a status/control register address and a data register address).
    *   **Memory-Mapped I/O:**
        *   **Method:** A portion of the CPU's memory address space is allocated to I/O controller registers.
        *   **Advantage:** Easier programming (CPU uses standard memory instructions).
        *   **Disadvantage:** Reduces the total available memory space for programs.
    *   **I/O-Mapped I/O:**
        *   **Method:** I/O devices have a separate address space distinct from memory.
        *   **Advantage:** Does not reduce the available memory address space.
        *   **Disadvantage:** Requires special I/O instructions, making programming more complex.

**C) DMA (Direct Memory Access)**

*   **Concept:** A method where an I/O device directly accesses main memory without CPU intervention. A **DMA controller (DMAC)** manages the bus for these direct transfers.
*   **Benefit:** Increases system efficiency for high-speed I/O devices by minimizing CPU interruptions and overhead, allowing the CPU to focus on other tasks.
*   **DMA Operation Sequence (Simplified):**
    1.  I/O device requests DMA service from the DMAC.
    2.  DMAC requests bus control from the CPU (via HOLD pin).
    3.  CPU grants bus control to DMAC (via HLDA pin).
    4.  DMAC places the memory address on the address bus.
    5.  DMAC signals the I/O device to place data on the data bus.
    6.  Data transfers directly between I/O device and memory.
    7.  DMAC updates address register and byte count.
    8.  Steps 4-7 repeat until all data is transferred.
    9.  DMAC releases bus control; CPU reclaims the bus.
*   **DMA Operation Modes:**
    *   **Cycle Stealing:**
        *   DMAC takes control of the bus for short periods (e.g., to transfer one word of data), "stealing" bus cycles from the CPU.
        *   Used when the DMAC and CPU need the bus simultaneously, giving priority to fast I/O.
    *   **Burst Mode:**
        *   DMAC acquires bus control and holds it until an entire block of data (multiple memory words) is transferred.
        *   Applicable to high-speed I/O devices that transfer data in large chunks.

### 3. Latest Technologies and Trends

**A) Neuromorphic Chip**

*   **Concept:** A new type of semiconductor designed to process information like the human brain, implementing brain-like behavior in silicon. It's a core technology for neuromorphic computing.
*   **Structure & Function:**
    *   Contains multiple cores, each embedding electronic devices (transistors, memory).
    *   Some devices in the core act as **neurons**; memory chips act as **synapses** (linking neurons).
    *   Configured in parallel, like the human brain.
*   **Comparison to Conventional Chips:**
    | Feature         | Conventional Computer Chip         | Neuromorphic Semiconductor            |
    | :-------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |

    | **Processing**  | Serial (one I/O at a time)         | Parallel (simultaneous data I/Os)     |
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Processes large data with low power consumption.
    *   Enhanced learning and operational capabilities.
    *   Can learn autonomously and adapt to context.
    *   Wide applicability: IoT, smartphones, robots, automobiles, cloud, supercomputing.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   Limited understanding of human neural circuits at a system level.
    *   Current simulations are mostly at the single-neuron level.
    *   Significant technical hurdles to achieve brain-level complexity.
    *   No clear leader in research globally.

**B) Quantum Computer**

*   **Concept:** A new computer type that uses principles of quantum mechanics (superposition and entanglement) to achieve ultra-high-speed, large-capacity processing for specific operations.
*   **Quantum Bits (Qubits):** The basic unit of information. Unlike classic bits (0 or 1), a qubit can be 0, 1, or a combination of both simultaneously (superposition). This enables **quantum parallel processing**.
*   **Comparison to Conventional Computers:**
    | Subject              | Existing Computer                     | Quantum Computer                         |
    | :------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
    | **Information Expr.**| 0 or 1                                | Overlapping 0s and 1s                    |
    | **Operation Concept**| Sequential calculation                | Simultaneous calculation (instantaneous) |

    | **Calculation Type** | Logic table                           | Matrix function                          |
    | **Error Correction** | Easy to correct errors                | Difficult to correct errors              |
    | **N-bit Memory**     | Remembers one value out of 2^N        | Remembers all 2^N values (overlap)       |
    | **Operational Thru.**| 1 operation for N bits                | 2^N operations for N qubits (simultaneous) |
*   **Types of Quantum Computers:**

E) Locality
The locality is a tendency  in which programs  intensively  refer to a specific  area in the moment,  rather than uniformly
accessing  information  in the memory  device.
+ Temporal  locality:  Recently  accessed  programs  or data are more likely to be accessed  again in the near future.
+ Spatial locality:  Data stored adjacent  to the storage  device is more likely to be accessed  continuously,
+ Sequential  locality: Instructions  are fetched  and executed  in the order in which they were stored, unless branched
(about  20%).

ESSENCE
Each device needs two addresses  (a status/control  register  address  and a data register  address)  for I/O control, and
the same two addresses  are required  for each device. It is divided into the memory  mapped  |/O and the I/O mapped  |/
O, depending  on how the addresses  are allocated.
+ Memory  mapped  |/O: It is a method  of allocating  a part of the address  area in the memory  to the register  addresses
in the I/O controller,  as shown in [Figure 37]. It has the advantage  of easy programming,  but the disadvantage  of
reducing  the available  memory  space.

@® Concept  of DMA
DMA is a method  of the I/O device directly  accessing  the memory  without  the assistance of the CPU. The DMA
controller  controls  the bus, and the I/O device and memory  transfer  information  directly. [Figure 39] shows the
system  structure  that includes  the DMA controller.

[Figure  39] System  Structure  Including  DMA
@ DMA operation  sequence
@® The I/O interface  requests  a DMA service  from the DMA controller.
@ The bus request  is transferred  to the CPU's HOLD pin, so that the DMA acquires  the control  of the bus (Active High).
® The bus grant is returned  from the CPU's HLDA (Hold Acknowledge)  pin, to the DMAC (Active  High).
@® The DMAC loads the contents  of the address  register  into the address  bus.
© The DMAC transfers  the DMA acknowledgment  to the I/O interface  in order to load the data into the data bus.
© The address  bus transfers  the data bytes to the identified  memory  location.
@ The I/O interface  maintains  the data transfer  (Latch).
The DMAC returns  the bus grant as the bus request  is dropped,  and the HOLD becomes  a low state.
© The bus grant is dropped,  and HLDA becomes  a low state.
Afterward,  the address  register  increases  by increments  pf 1, and the byte count decreases  by decrements  of 1.
@ The process  retums  to Step © if the byte count is not 0, and otherwise  stops.
