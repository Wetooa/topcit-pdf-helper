01 Concept  and Elements  of Business  Communication
In order to examine  what business  communication  is, we will first look at business  and communication,
respectively,  and then make a final definition  of business  communication.  Finally, we seek to understand
the general overview  of business communication  by looking at the key elements  that make up business
communication.
A) Definition  of business  communication
Business, by definition,  means continually  managing  something  in a structured  manner  with a certain purpose
and plan’. In general, the term business  refers to all the activities  performed  by a general company,  but in
some cases, it refers to a business  item or a business  area. In business  administration,  business  is a series of
activities  that provide  products  and services  to customers  and obtain profits in return.
Communication  in English  comes from the Latin word communicare,  meaning  “to share”. Communication  refers
to a system or process  that shares information  or meaning  through  mutually  understood  means between  two
different  people or groups.
Business  communication  refers to a system and process  in which a company  shares with various  stakeholders
information  and meanings  arising in the process  of performing  a series of business  to provide  products  or ser-
vices to customers  in return for profits.  The goal is to achieve  business  goals through  this.
In order to share information  in the process  of achieving  business  goals, meeting  or making  calls, exchanging
e-mails, making  presentation  materials,  etc. are conducted  based on transference  and understanding,  among
various  stakeholders  regardless  of individuals  or groups.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
The key elements  of business  communication  are the information  to be shared,  the sender  and receiver  of the
information,  and the medium  for information  sharing, like for any other form of communication.  In addition,  in
order for the sender  to include  information  in the medium,  an encoding  process  is required,  and in order for the
receiver  to obtain information  from the medium,  a decoding  process  is required.  During this process,  noise may
inevitably  occur from all elements  of the sender, encoding,  medium,  decoding,  and receiver.  Therefore,  in the
process  of performing  business  communication,  a feedback  process  is essential  to minimize  noise and confirm
whether  clear information  is received.
