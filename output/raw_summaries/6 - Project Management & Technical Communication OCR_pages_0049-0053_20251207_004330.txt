## Technical Document Learning Guide

This guide covers essential principles for writing technical documents and details various common document types.

---

### **Part 1: General Principles of Technical Document Writing**

To ensure completeness and accuracy, **proofreading and review should be conducted while writing** technical documents.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Consistency:**
    *   **Logical Causal Relationship:** Main requirements must logically connect to core content, and core content to written content.
    *   **Uniformity:** Maintain consistent nature from start to finish (e.g., font, color, descriptive technique).
    *   **Substance:** Content should be arranged logically (e.g., if discussing transportation, group by train, bus, taxi).
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   **SW Technical Documents:** Must be written precisely.
    *   **Functionality:** Stated structure and algorithms should accurately reflect required software functions.
*   **Suitability:**
    *   **Purpose-driven:** Documents must be described to suit their purpose.
    *   **User Focus:** Clearly state the document's purpose to match the user's needs.

ESSENCE
Since it is not possible  to invest indefinitely  the cost and time for writing the document,  proofreading  and
review should be conducted  while writing the text. This can increase the completeness  of the document  by
improving  the accuracy  and logic.
<Table 8> Consistency  and Relevance
« There must be a logical causal relationship  between  the main requirements  of the documentBern and the core contents, the selected core contents  and the written contents.
+ One method  or point of view, etc. must have the consistent  nature  from start to finish. It
means that the presentation  of the main content  described  in the document  should be
Consistency similar.
« E.g.) Formally,  the font, color, and descriptive  technique  should be constant,  and in terms of
substance,  if it is about a means of transportation,  it should be arranged  by train, bus, taxi,
etc.
« When writing  SW technical  documents,  you must write them accurately.
Accuracy + The stated structure  and algorithm  should be described  to show that they accurately
perform  the functions  required  by the software.
+ Technical  documents  must be properly  described  to suit the purpose  of the document.
Suitability + The purpose  of the document  should be clearly stated to suit the purpose  of use of the user
who uses the technical  document.
03 Writing  Technical  Documents
A) Business  plan (plan)
The business  plan is a guideline  that includes  business-related  details such as the content  of the project,  the
characteristics  of the target market, and the possibility  of success  in the market so that the business  plan
can review the feasibility  of the project  and prepare  for possible  future risks.
<Table 9> Composition  of Business  Plan
Classification Content
1. General  Status + Overview  of the project
2. Goals + Describe  the goals you are trying to achieve  through  the project
3. Content * Content  of the project
4, Business  Method « Method  of conducting  the project
eirinenes « Promotion  cost
+ Promotion  personnel
6. Expected  Effects + Expected  effects  that can be obtained  through  the project

<Table 10> Principles  of Writing  business  plan
Classification Content
+ The business  plan should be written in an easy-to-understand  way to convince  third
parties  such as investors  and customers
« In particular,  product  and technical  analysis  should avoid using technical  terms as
much as possible,  and should be composed  of simple and universal  content.Easy to understand
+ If itis judged that it is not feasible in the view of a third party, reliability  may be
Feasibility severely  damaged.  Therefore,  it is recommended  to write the document  based on
evidence  from public  or professional  organizations.
+ If the business  plan is mediocre,  it cannot  appeal to a third party. It is necessary
to explain the product  focusing  on the characteristics  of the product  with the
expectation  that the planned  product  will be more appealing  to the consumer  than
the competitor  product.Highlight  the core content
+ If arguments  and viewpoints  do not match, it lowers the credibility  of the entire
Consistency  and accuracy business  plan. Therefore,  it is necessary  to unify and express  numbers  and units, and
to write with a consistent  flow and theme.
+ In-depth  analysis  of potential  problems  in the planned  project  and possible  risk
factors  in the future, and inspections  from various  angles are required  to ensure  that
the project  is not delayed  or made impossible  due to unexpected  circumstances.In-depth  analysis  of problems  and
risk factors
B) Request  for Information  (RFI)
Since it can be viewed as a process to determine  who is an external  company  that can solve the problem
facing the company,  the information  that is usually requested  is a brief introduction  to the external  company,
credit-related  information,  and experience  in performing  related services.  If necessary,  it also inquires of the
scope of the project  budget.

C) Request  for proposal  (RFP)
This is a document  that informs bidders  of the ordering  agency's  system and business  status, problems,  and
requirements  so that the ordering  agency can successfully  carry out projects such as information  system
establishment  and describe  in detail the matters  necessary  for the proposal.  This is an official document  that
