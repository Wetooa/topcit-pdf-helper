## **IT Business & Ethics: Strategy & Value Chain**

### **1. IT's Evolving Role in the Business Value Chain**

The traditional Value Chain Model, which outlines a company's key and support activities, is fundamentally transformed by IT.

*   **Company-wide IT Integration:**
    *   IT is no longer just for "back-office" functions.
    *   It's integrated into *all* key and support activities of a company's value chain.
    *   **Example:** A hypermarket uses IT for real-time inventory, customer behavior analysis, and purchase history tracking to stay competitive.
*   **IT-Specialized Companies:**
    *   For e-businesses or Internet businesses (e.g., Amazon.com, Interpark), IT is the core.
    *   Their key and support activities are inseparable from IT; a new perspective on the value chain is needed.
*   **Expansion of the Value Chain Model:**
    *   Our understanding of the value chain must adapt to IT's dual role:
        1.  IT integrated *into* existing business processes.
        2.  IT *as* the main business itself.
    *   **Impact of IT Integration:**
        *   Drives structural changes within companies.
        *   Eliminates unnecessary processes (e.g., through intranet information systems).
        *   Transforms hierarchical organizations into more horizontal ones by sharing information more broadly.
        *   IT's impact creates a "new" value chain concept that influences organizational structure and competitive advantage.

### **2. IT Business Strategy: Introduction**

**IT Business Strategy** is about finding the most effective way to achieve a company's mission and objectives by integrating IT and business processes, considering both internal and external environments.

*   **Key Focus:** Establishing strategies and analyzing the environment before formulation.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Explain IT business strategy.
    2.  Explain business environment analysis models for IT strategy formulation.
*   **Keywords:** IT business strategy formulation, IT business environment analysis.

### **3. Practical Example: Dell Computers' SWOT Analysis (Mid-1990s)**

Dell used **SWOT analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to develop its IT business strategy.

*   **Strengths (Internal):**
    *   Ability to sell directly to consumers.
    *   Ability to design components to lower manufacturing costs.
    *   Lower prices than competitors.
*   **Weaknesses (Internal):**
    *   No relationships with local computer dealerships.
*   **Opportunities (External):**
    *   Consumer demand for one-stop shopping.
    *   Consumers had good computer knowledge and knew what they wanted.
    *   The Internet emerged as a powerful marketing tool.
*   **Threats (External):**
    *   Competitors (Compaq, IBM) had superior brand power and quality reputation.
    *   Competitors had strong relationships with local dealerships.
*   **Dell's Strategy based on SWOT:**
    *   **Leveraged Strengths & Opportunities:** Assembled and sold custom-built computers directly to customers (initially phone, then Internet).
    *   **Addressed Weaknesses & Threats:** Eliminated dependence on local dealer networks, directly counteracting competitor advantages in that area. Built high-quality, tailored PCs shipped immediately, neutralizing brand/quality threats.

### **4. Phases of IT Business Strategy**

Developing an IT business strategy involves two main phases:

**Phase 1: Establishment of IT Business Strategy**
*   Defining the strategy's general concept, elements, and process.

**Phase 2: Analysis of the IT Business Environment**
*   Involves analyzing external, internal, and then consolidated environments.

    *   **A. External Environment Analysis:**
        *   **Macro-External (PEST Technique):** Analyzes broad external factors:
            *   **P**olitical
            *   **E**conomic
            *   **S**ocial
            *   **T**echnical
        *   **Micro-External (Porter's 5-Forces Industry Structure Analysis):** Analyzes competitive forces within an industry:
            *   Bargaining power of suppliers
            *   Bargaining power of buyers
            *   Threat of new entrants
            *   Threat of substitute products or services
            *   Intensity of rivalry among existing competitors
        *   **Marketing/Competitive Market Analysis:**
            *   **4P Technique:** Product, Price, Place, Promotion.
            *   **3C Technique:** Company, Customers, Competitors.
    *   **B. Internal Environment Analysis (McKinsey 7S Method):**
        *   Analyzes 7 interconnected internal elements:
            *   **S**hared Values, **S**trategy, **S**tructure, **S**ystems, **S**taff, **S**tyle, **S**kills.
    *   **C. Consolidated Environment Analysis:**
        *   **SWOT Analysis:** Combines external opportunities/threats with internal strengths/weaknesses.
        *   **BCG Matrix:** Used with SWOT to select business development strategies based on an IT business's growth potential and market share (e.g., Stars, Cash Cows, Question Marks, Dogs).

### **5. Establishing an IT Business Strategy: Detailed View**

**A. Concept of Strategy Establishment:**
*   Defining strategies to fulfill an organization's mission.
*   Requires analysis of current status and a clear direction for change.
*   Must align with strategies at all organizational levels.
*   The output (strategic plan) provides overall direction for Enterprise Architecture (EA), process improvement, risk management, and portfolio management.

**B. Elements of a Strategy Plan:**

| Element              | Description                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basic Information**  | Company's mission, objectives/goals, quantitative performance results.           |
| **Current Status Model** | The "As-Is" state: current internal/external environment, business principles, values. |
| **Future Goal Model**  | The "To-Be" state: the vision and specific goals for the future.                |
| **Implementation Strategy** | The roadmap or actions to achieve the future goals and mission.                 |

**C. Strategy Development Process (As-Is to To-Be):**
1.  **Evaluate Current (As-Is) Model:** Understand the company's present state.
2.  **Present Future (To-Be) Model:** Define the desired future state and goals.
3.  **Develop Implementation Strategies:** Create plans to transform the company from the As-Is to the To-Be model.

**D. Interdependence of Strategy Elements (Simplified Flow):**

*   **Mission:** The organization's highest purpose and achievement.
*   **Vision:** Future aspirations and goals, guided by the mission.
*   **Goals/Objectives:** Specific, measurable targets derived from the vision.
*   **Implementation Strategies/Initiatives:** Actions and plans to achieve objectives and vision.
*   **Performance Index/Measures:** Metrics used to track progress and success in realizing goals.

perspectives.
B) Company-wide  integration  of the value chain model and IT
IT is being applied  throughout  all the key activities  and support  activities  that constitute  the elements  of a company’s
value chain model. This signifies  that the role of IT is no longer limited to back-office  functions,  but that IT is being
integrated  and utilized as a key factor in every aspect  of a company’s  key activities.
For example,  let's look at the typical example  of a hypermarket.  Without  IT, would it be possible  to pursue the five
key activities  of the value chain model normally  or do it in a way that would be competitive?  In an environment  where
managers  working  for a hypermarket  can check inventory  and product  information  in realtime,  place products  on
shelves  in ways that reflect  customer  shopping  behaviors  and local characteristics,  and collect customers’  purchasing
histories  in realtime,  the answer  to this question  would be a resounding  ‘NO’. In other words, today, when the
operations  of all key activities  defined by the value chain model are based on IT, the above question  suggests  a new
perception  about the convergence  of the value chain model and IT. Leaving  aside the example  of hypermarkets,  the
situation  is pretty much the same in other industries  referred  to as “smokestack  industries”.
C) Value chain model and IT specialized  companies
When a company’s  business  model is e-business  or Internet  business,  it is hard to explain its key activities  and
support  activities  separately  from IT. For example,  Amazon.com  is a leading  example  of a company  that performs
both its key activities  and its supporting  activities  using IT. Likewise,  Interpark  in Korea is considered  a similar case. In
other words, companies  that began their operations  as [T-based  entities  cannot be understood  if the key activities
and support  activities  defined in their value chain models  are considered  separately.  In such situations,  the traditional
value chain model has to be approached  from a new perspective.
D) Expansion  of the value chain model
The two perspectives  explained  above are related to the two angles mentioned  when explaining  the IT business.
Just as when one tries to understand  the IT business,  one must view it in terms of two different  trends,  that’s to say
one in which IT is integrated  into the business  processes  across the whole company,  and another  in which IT is used
as the main business,  the value chain model can also be understood  in two different  ways. Therefore,  since most
companies  today are pursuing  their IT business  in the hope of gaining a competitive  edge from IT, our understanding
of the traditional  value chain model must also be expanded  from the business  perspective.
Such an expanded  understanding  of IT is raising several issues in academia  and in the field. Traditional  job processes
that have long been taken for granted are driving structural  changes  in companies  following  the company-wide
integration  of IT. Examples  include the elimination  of unnecessary  processes  in the decision-making  process  through
the adoption  of an intranet  information  system, and the transformation  of a company  into a more horizontal
organization  in which quality information  is supplied  to all employees  - information  that otherwise  would have been
held by a privileged  few. That is, the perception  is spreading  that the utilization  of IT is not limited  to just being
integrated  into the value chain model activities,  but that it is a (new) concept  of value chain model that could have a
decisive  impact  on the structure  of an entire organization  and its competitive  advantages.

ESSENCE
>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
The development  of a company’s  IT business  strategy  is the process  of finding the most effective  way
of achieving  its mission and objectives  under the constraints  of the internal and external  environments
to which it is subject.  Setting  the right strategy  is particularly critical for this new concept  of IT business,
which involves  the integration  of IT and business  processes.  As the domain of IT business  continues  to
expand,  and the business  process  becomes  ever more closely integrated  with IT, interest  is growing  in how
to establish  IT business  strategies  and find the right way to analyze  the environment  before setting  one’s
strategies.  This section introduces  the current  model and the future model, which are essential  elements
in developing  IT business  strategies,  as well as the strategies  for implementing  them, and also presents
different  methods  of analyzing  the IT business  environment  (including  SWOT  analysis).
