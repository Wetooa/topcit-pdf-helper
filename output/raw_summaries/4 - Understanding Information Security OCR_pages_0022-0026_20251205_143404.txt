### Part 2: Cryptographic Techniques

#### 2.1 Concept of a Cipher
*   **Cryptography**: The overall process of transforming data to protect it.
*   **Encryption**: Converts **plaintext** (readable data) into **ciphertext** (unintelligible form).
*   **Decryption**: Converts **ciphertext** back into **plaintext**.
*   **Cryptographic Algorithm**: A mathematical function used for encryption and decryption.
*   **Key**: A secret value used by the cryptographic algorithm to perform encryption and decryption.
*   **Purpose**: Encryption is a primary method to achieve **confidentiality** in information security.

#### 2.2 Classification of Cryptographic Techniques

Cryptographic techniques are broadly divided into two main categories:

**A) Cryptographic Techniques (Algorithms)**
These focus on how data is actually scrambled and unscrambled. They are classified based on the keys used:
*   **Symmetric Key Cryptosystem**: Uses the *same key* for both encryption and decryption.
*   **Public Key Cryptosystem**: Uses *different keys* for encryption and decryption (a public key and a private key).

**B) Cryptographic Protocols**
These are predefined sequences of steps where two or more parties use cryptographic techniques to achieve a specific security goal.
*   **Purpose**: To ensure security properties like authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation (proof that an action occurred and cannot be denied).
*   **Examples**: Protocols for individual identification, electronic payments, electronic signatures, and electronic elections.

#### 2.3 Cryptographic Algorithm Explained
A cryptographic algorithm uses a key to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice-versa.
*   **Encryption**: `C = E(KE, P)`
    *   `P`: Plaintext (original message)
    *   `E`: Encryption function
    *   `KE`: Encryption Key
    *   `C`: Ciphertext (encrypted message)
*   **Decryption**: `P = D(KD, C)`
    *   `D`: Decryption function
    *   `KD`: Decryption Key
*   **Key Types**: In some systems (like public key), `KE` and `KD` can be different.
*   **How it Works**: A sender encrypts plaintext with an encryption key and sends the ciphertext over an insecure network. The receiver uses a decryption key to convert the ciphertext back to plaintext, ensuring confidentiality.
*   **Computational Impossibility**: It means that without knowing the correct decryption key, it is practically impossible to understand the plaintext from the ciphertext within a reasonable amount of time, even if infinite time *could* eventually break it.

#### 2.4 Cryptosystem
*   **Definition**: A cryptosystem encompasses all the components necessary for a complete encryption and decryption process (e.g., algorithms, keys, and processes).
*   **Key Requirements**:
    *   Encryption and decryption should be performed efficiently.
    *   The cryptosystem should be user-friendly.
    *   Security should primarily rely on keeping the **key secret**, rather than on the secrecy of the cryptographic algorithm itself (Kerckhoffs's Principle).

#### 2.5 Private Key (Symmetric) Encryption Algorithm
*   **Key Feature**: Uses the **same key** for both encryption and decryption.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Key length can be relatively short.
    *   Encryption and decryption operations are very fast.
*   **Disadvantages / Challenges**:
    *   **Key Distribution**: Difficult to securely share the secret key over long distances.
    *   **Key Management**: Burdensome to generate and manage unique keys for many different communication partners.
*   **Other Names**: Also known as **Secret Key Encryption** or **Conventional Encryption**.
*   **Continued Use**: Despite key sharing difficulties, it's still widely used due to its speed, often achieved through combinations of substitution and transposition methods.
*   **Types (by processing method)**:
    *   **Block Cipher**: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., AES, DES).
    *   **Stream Cipher**: Encrypts data bit by bit or byte by byte.

>>> Recent  trends and major issues
The seriousness  of the problems  caused by the expansion  and development  of the cyber world
are increasing  day by day. Even Windows  and anti-virus  patch programs  are sometimes  distributed
after infection  with a virus or alteration.  From the viewpoint  of information  security,  various security
threats can be actively  responded  to by ensuring  confidentiality  and integrity.  Confidentiality  is
based on the concept  that data should be viewed only by authorized  and legitimate  users who hold
the right to access the data, whereas  integrity  is based on the concept  that data should be the
original data without  forgery  or alteration.  Therefore,  it is very important  to individually  or collectively
ensure confidentiality  and integrity  in information  security,  by applying  them while considering  the
characteristics  of each piece of data.
To be able to explain the concept  of ciphers  and classical  ciphers  to support  confidentiality.
To be able to explain private  key encryption  and public key encryption  algorithms.
To be able to explain the hash function  to support  integrity.
To be able to explain the hash function  to support  integrity.
To be able to explain the electronic  signature  and public key infrastructure  (PKI) for secure
transactions.

+ Preview  for practical  business  Managing  information  safely
Assistant  manager  Kim, working  for web application  program  development  company  A, has been in
charge of developing, deploying,  and maintaining  Java-based  source  programs.  He should check the
web pages and servers on a regular basis when processing  his work. However,  he is not safe from
various security  threats  that are becoming  diversified  and intelligent  by regular  check only.
He also should exchange  source programs  with partners  while doing his work and should ensure that
those source programs  are not disclosed  to other competitors.
In such a situation,  confidentiality  must be ensured so that a large number  of source programs,
managed  by Kim, are not disclosed  to unauthorized  third parties during storage or transmission.
To do this, let’s see what steps Kim should take, and how to apply the concept  of confidentiality  in
practice.

01 Cryptographic  techniques
A) Concept  of a cipher
Encryption  is the process of converting  plain text, which can be seen by anyone, into an incomprehensible
form of ciphertext.  Decryption  is the process  of converting  ciphertext  back into plaintext,  so that it can be
understood.  These two processes  are called cryptography.  The mathematical  function  used in these two
conversion  processes  is called a cryptographic  algorithm.  The cryptographic  algorithm  uses a key to perform
encryption  and decryption. In short, encryption  is an important  means to obtain confidentiality,  which is one of
the three main goals of information  security.
B) Encryption  and decryption
Encryption  is the process  of converting  plain text into a form (ciphertext)  that cannot  be recognized  by a third
party, whereas  decryption  is the reverse process  of encryption. That is, decryption  is the process  of restoring
converted  ciphertext  back into plaintext.

Initially, encryption  was mainly used for military purposes.  However,  it is used to protect  a variety  of important
information  with the development  of information,communication,  and Internet  technology.
C) Classification  of cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  are classified  into the cryptographic  technique  and cryptographic  protocol  technique.
@® Cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  can be divided  into the symmetric  key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption  key
and the decryption  key are the same, and the public key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption  key and the
decryption  key are different,  depending  on whether  the encryption  key and the decryption  key are the same.
