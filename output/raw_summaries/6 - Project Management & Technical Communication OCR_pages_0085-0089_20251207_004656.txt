## Project Scope Management & WBS Learning Guide

### Introduction: Understanding WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)

*   **Common Misconception:** WBS is often mistakenly seen as a schedule management tool.
*   **Reality:** WBS is a **deliverable of scope management**, as defined by PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) from PMI (Project Management Institute).
*   **Why it Matters:** WBS plays a crucial role in managing scope changes (e.g., new or changed requirements). Using it for scope changes helps manage related elements like schedule, cost, and quality simultaneously.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Use WBS primarily as a **scope management tool**.

### Section 1: Concept of Scope Management

*   **What is Project Scope Management?**
    *   One of the three important knowledge areas in project management.
    *   Essential for project success, as projects are unique, temporary, and goal-driven.
    *   Involves clearly defining what needs to be done and excluding anything unnecessary, even if requested by the client.
*   **What is "Scope"?**
    *   The total sum of products and services provided through the project, or the total work required to successfully complete it.
    *   **Two Types of Scope:**
        *   **Project Scope (The HOW):** All the work required to create the specified products, services, and outputs.
            *   **Completion Measured By:** Project plan.
        *   **Product Scope (The WHAT):** The features and functions of the product, service, or output itself.
            *   **Completion Measured By:** Product requirements.

### Section 2: Scope Management Process

The scope management process follows these six steps:

1.  **Scope Management Planning**
2.  **Requirements Collection**
3.  **Scope Definition**
4.  **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Formulation**
5.  **Scope Validation**
6.  **Scope Control**

### Section 3: Detailed Process Steps

#### 1. Scope Management Planning

*   **Purpose:** To develop the **Project Scope Management Plan**. This plan defines how the project scope will be defined, confirmed, and controlled.
*   **Key Contents of the Plan:**
    *   Procedure for describing the project scope.
    *   How the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be formulated.
    *   Criteria for verifying and validating deliverables.
    *   Format and procedure for requesting scope changes.
*   **Important:** This plan must be shared and agreed upon by both the client and the service provider.

#### 2. Requirements Collection

*   **Objective:** To understand not only *what* the customer needs, but more importantly, *why* they need it.
*   **Benefit:** Understanding the "why" helps avoid unnecessary development and focuses resources on truly important aspects. (e.g., F-16 example: improving maneuverability for engagement capabilities vs. chasing raw speed).
*   **Common Techniques:**
    *   **Interview:** Systematic oral discussions with individuals or groups to gather requirements.
    *   **Prototyping:** Quickly building a partial or full system model to get user understanding and feedback.
    *   **Moderator Meeting (Facilitated Workshop):** A group discussion guided by a moderator to generate ideas for products, services, or improvements.
    *   **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documents (e.g., business plans, market research, contracts, RFPs, SOWs, old system designs) to identify system requirements.

#### 3. Scope Definition

*   **Purpose:** To identify the project's key scope after requirements collection and formulate detailed scope statements for both the project and its products. This ensures a common understanding of business functions.
*   **Scope Statement:** This document specifies the criteria for outputs and delivery, including characteristics like exclusions, constraints, and assumptions. It clearly defines the project boundaries.
*   **Requirements for a Good Scope Definition:**
    *   **Clear Scope:** Must be unambiguously defined, preventing different interpretations. It's fundamental for other requirements.
    *   **Complete Scope:** Should have no missing, excessive, or overlapping parts.
    *   **Agreed-upon Scope:** All stakeholders must reach a consensus on the scope *before* project execution to avoid issues later.
    *   **Manageable Scope:** The scope must be defined in a way that allows for easy integration with other plans (like schedule and budget) using the WBS framework.
        *   **Specifically, manageable means:**
            *   Duration and cost can be accurately estimated.
            *   A person in charge can be designated.
            *   Performance can be realistically evaluated.

#### 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Formulation

*   **What it is:** The WBS is created by breaking down project deliverables and the entire scope into smaller, more manageable components.
*   **Importance:** This is considered a critical activity not just for scope management, but for the entire project.
*   **Benefits:** Helps prevent missing tasks, clarifies relationships between tasks, and enables consistent communication with stakeholders and sponsors.

#### 5. Scope Validation

*   **Purpose:** To formally confirm and gain approval from the client or project leader for the completed project deliverables.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Inspection:** Measuring, examining, and confirming performance to ensure tasks and deliverables meet requirements and delivery criteria (e.g., conducting Reviews and Walkthroughs).
    *   Technical review by the project team to identify any defects, specifications, or standards issues.

#### 6. Scope Control

*   **Purpose:** To monitor the status of the project and product scope, managing any changes according to formal procedures.
*   **Key Aspects:**
    *   Ensures all requested changes, recommended corrective actions, and preventive actions are processed throughout the project.
    *   Scope changes are frequent and often impact schedule and cost.
    *   All scope changes must be reported to the **Project Change Control Board (CCB)**, their impacts reviewed, and formally approved.

### Section 4: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - Detailed

#### A. Concept of WBS

*   **Definition:** A hierarchical structure of tasks, classified by project deliverables, and broken down into manageable packages.
*   **Work Package:** The lowest-level subtask item within the WBS.
    *   **Example:** For an "online bulletin board" project, work packages could be "Write text," "Delete text," "Edit text," and "File upload."
*   **Structure:** Most commonly represented as a **tree diagram**, which clearly shows parent-to-child relationships and hierarchy for intuitive understanding.

#### B. Components of WBS

*   **Work Package:**
    *   The lowest-level unit of the WBS.
    *   For this unit, cost and duration can be planned, estimated, monitored, and controlled.
*   **Code of Account:**
    *   A unique identification or numbering system assigned to each work package in the WBS.
*   **WBS Dictionary:**
    *   A detailed description for each work package.
    *   Includes an outline of the work, schedule, person in charge, and budget.
*   **RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix):**
    *   A standard that defines who is responsible for each element.
    *   Specifies roles like the approver at each stage, quality reviewer, and input manager.

+ Preview  for practical business
Often, the work breakdown  structure (WBS) is misunderstood  as a schedule  management  output or
tool. This is because  it is used to track progress  of a project  as the start and end dates are specified
in the work package  (the lowest unit of work), which is a component  of the WBS. Moreover,  it is
not unusual to think that WBS exists for schedule  management  as the commonly  used schedule
management  tool of Microsoft  has a structure  that manages  the schedule  with WBS uploaded  in the
form of a file.
However,  it is clear that WBS is a deliverable  of scope management  because  it is included  as “Create
WBS” in PMBOK  (Project  Management  Body of Knowledge)  of PMI (Project  Management  Institute).
Then, why is it important  to distinguish  “whether  WBS is a deliverable  of scope management  or
schedule  management.”  This is because  WBS plays a very important  role in scope management.
When scope changes  in a project,  i.e. when requirements  change  or are added, the first thing to look
at is the WBS. If you are aware that WBS is used for managing  changes,  you can manage  any related
elements  from schedule,  cost, and to quality all at once.
From now on, let's use WBS as a tool for scope management  rather than schedule  management!
01 Concept  and Process  of Scope Management
A) Concept  of scope management
The first of the three important  knowledge  areas in project  management  is scope management.  Since a proj-
ect is a unique, temporary,  and goal-driven  activity, it is important  to have a clear goal and scope to make it
successful.
In a project, it is necessary  to do what needs to be done and exclude  anything  that is unnecessary,  even if demand-
ed by the client. As a project  manager,  the first thing to do is to clarify and define the scope of his or her work.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
The scope is “the sum of products  and services provided  through  the project”  and means the range of work
or the work itself required  to successfully  complete  the project. The scope is divided into project scope and
product  scope.
+ Scope = project  scope + product  scope
Project scope refers to all the work required  to create products,  services,  and outputs  of specified  features
and functions.  The product  range refers to the features  and functions  of the product  distinguished  from other
products,  services,  and outputs.  The project scope is about how products  and services  are provided,  that is,
the HOW aspect, and the product  range is about the product  and service itself, that is, the WHAT aspect. The
criteria for determining  whether  the scope is complete  differs for each project scope and product  scope. The
completion  of the project scope is measured  based on the project plan, and the completion  of the product
scope is measured  based on the product  requirements.
B) Scope management  process
The scope management  process proceeds  in the order of scope management  planning,  requirements  collec-
tion, scope definition,  work breakdown  system  (WBS) formation,  scope validation,  and scope control.
@® Scope Management  Planning
* Concept  of Scope Management  Planning
Project scope refers to tasks necessary  for project execution  in order to deliver products  and services,  which
are the final products  of the project, to customers,  and project scope management  is a process  to develop  a
project  scope management  plan to define, confirm,  and control the project  scope.
+ Project  Scope Management  Plan
The project scope management  plan defines  the process  to be carried out by the project stage and the level
of execution  of each process. The main items of the project scope management  plan are as follows, and the
scope plan should be shared between  the client and the service provider.
+ A procedure  to describe  project  scope
+ How to formulate  Work Breakdown  System(WBS)
+ Verification  and validation  criteria  for outputs  to be delivered  to customers
+ Explanation  on the format  and procedure  to request  for scope change
@ Collect  Requirements
In a project on the ground, it is important  to find out what the customer  needs and why they think they
need it. The following  is an example  of the development  of an F-16  fighter  jet in the 1970s on why collecting
requirements  is so important.
At the time, the F-16 fighter aircraft  was required  to fly at a speed of Mach 2.5. However,  the  fighter  jet, by
design, was not able to reach the speed above Mach 2. The designer  of the fighter  jet asked the U.S. Air Force
to clarify the speed requirement  as to why and received  a response  from the U.S. Air Force that it was to
improve  engagement  capabilities.  The designer  thought  that it would be possible  to improve  maneuverability
rather than speed to enhance  engagement  capabilities,  and applied fly-by-wire, ...
