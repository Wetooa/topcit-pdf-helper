# Data and System Security Learning Guide

## 1. Database Encryption: Core Concepts

### 1.1 What is Two-Way Cipher Encryption?
*   A method to encrypt (scramble) and decrypt (unscramble) sensitive data, like personal information.
*   Uses a **two-way cipher algorithm**, meaning data can be both encrypted and returned to its original form.

### 1.2 Secure vs. Insecure Algorithms
*   **Secure Block Cipher Algorithms (Recommended):**
    *   SEED
    *   ARIA
    *   AES (Rijndael)
*   **Insecure Block Cipher Algorithms (Avoid/Upgrade):**
    *   DES
    *   3-DES

### 1.3 When to Apply Database Encryption
Encryption is crucial in two main scenarios:
1.  **Data stored in plain text:** When sensitive information exists in an unencrypted, readable format in a database.
2.  **Using insecure algorithms:** When data is already encrypted but with weak algorithms (e.g., DES, 3-DES).

## 2. Database Encryption: Application Scenarios

### 2.1 Encrypting Plain Text Data
*   **Action:** Encrypt personal information using a **128-bit or higher secret key**.
*   **Key Management:** The secret key used for encryption must be stored **separately in a safe place**, away from the encrypted data itself.
*   **Example:** Social Security Numbers (SSN) stored as plain text are encrypted using SEED, and the SEED key is secured elsewhere.

### 2.2 Upgrading Insecure Encryption
*   **Scenario:** If a database uses weak encryption like DES or 3-DES.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Decrypt the existing data (encrypted with the insecure algorithm) using a batch job.
    2.  Re-encrypt the data using a secure block encryption algorithm (e.g., SEED, ARIA, AES).
*   **Key Management:** The new, secure encryption key must be stored **separately in a safe place**.

## 3. Database Encryption: Implementation Procedure

Applying database encryption is a structured process with five key phases:

### 3.1 Phase 1: Prior Consultation
*   **Goal:** Ensure all project stakeholders are aligned and informed.
*   **Activities:** Discuss the database to be encrypted, applicable environment, security policy, and project schedule.

### 3.2 Phase 2: Impact Analysis (Critical Phase)
*   **Goal:** Understand how encryption will affect the application and database management system (DBMS) *before* implementation. This is one of the most important phases.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Selecting Encryption Targets:** Identify specific tables and columns within the DBMS that contain sensitive data and need encryption.
    *   **Analyzing Query Statements:**
        *   Examine all database queries.
        *   Analyze query execution time and data volume.
        *   Identify queries that may require optimization after encryption is applied.
    *   **Analyzing DBMS:**
        *   Check current resource usage (CPU, memory, storage).
        *   Calculate the additional resources needed to handle encryption overhead.
    *   **Analyzing Applications:**
        *   Identify application modules affected by encryption.
        *   Determine required changes to application logic and common modules.
        *   Select modules for optimization.

### 3.3 Phase 3: Test Verification
*   **Goal:** Validate the encryption solution in a controlled environment similar to production.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Create a test environment mirroring the live system.
    *   Conduct business tests and application tests with encryption applied.
    *   Identify and resolve any issues or problems that arise during testing.
    *   Test all applications and query statements to ensure full functionality and performance.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Application & Monitoring
*   **Goal:** Deploy the validated encryption solution to the live operating environment and ensure continuous smooth operation.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Apply encryption to data in the production environment.
    *   Integrate modified source code and optimized queries from the test phase.
    *   Resolve any remaining issues identified during testing.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly check for errors in applications and query statements, ensuring proper system functioning after encryption.

## 4. Database Encryption: Key Management

### 4.1 Importance of Key Management
*   **Criticality:** If an encryption/decryption key is leaked, the encryption becomes ineffective.
*   **Principle:** Keys must be **redundant** (e.g., encryption/decryption key and master key) and accessible only by authorized persons.

### 4.2 Types of Encryption Keys
*   **Encryption/Decryption Key:** The key directly used to encrypt data and decrypt already encrypted data.
*   **Master Key:** A key used to secure (store and distribute) the encryption/decryption keys themselves.

### 4.3 Key Lifecycle Management

Effective key management involves securing keys throughout their entire lifecycle:

*   **1. Key Generation Stage:**
    *   Generate keys using a **safe random number generator**.
    *   For keys derived from user input, use algorithms with **proven stability**.
*   **2. Key Distribution Stage:**
    *   Distribute encryption keys securely by **encrypting them with an asymmetric key cipher algorithm**. This ensures only authorized recipients can access them.
*   **3. Key Storage Stage:**
    *   Store encryption keys using **hardware storage methods**, such as a separate Key Management Server or an **HSM (Hardware Security Module)**.
    *   **AVOID:** Hardcoding keys into application programs, saving them as files on the file system, or storing them within the DBMS.
*   **4. Key Use Stage:**
    *   Apply **"least privilege"** and **"separation of duty"** principles (e.g., between database administrators and security managers).
    *   Only authorized personnel should be allowed to access or modify the master key.
*   **5. Key Backup & Recovery Stage:**
    *   Establish clear **backup and recovery procedures** for encryption keys.
    *   Perform **periodic backups** according to the organization's key backup policy to mitigate loss or damage.
*   **6. Key Replacement Stage:**
    *   Periodically **replace encryption keys** based on internal organizational policy to maintain security.
    *   **Procedure:** Decrypt data with the old key, generate a new key, and then re-encrypt the data with the new key.
*   **7. Key Destruction Stage:**
    *   **When needed:** If an encryption key is lost or damaged.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use a backed-up key to decrypt any data encrypted with the lost/damaged key.
        2.  Generate a new encryption key and re-encrypt the data.
        3.  Securely destroy the lost or damaged encryption key.

## 5. System Security Fundamentals

### 5.1 Recent Trends & Major Issues
*   **Increased Attacks:** Growing number of system-targeted attacks, especially **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** attacks.
*   **Rising Importance:** System security is becoming as critical as network security (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
*   **Key Focus Areas:** Strengthening **access control**, improving **security settings**, and robust **account management**.
*   **Goal:** Prevent system administrator rights hijacking and unauthorized internal user access to information security resources.

### 5.2 Learning Objectives
*   Be able to apply security settings to **Windows systems**.
*   Be able to apply security settings to **UNIX and Linux systems**.

### 5.3 Important Keywords
*   **Account and Password Management:** Practices for creating, maintaining, and securing user accounts and passwords.
*   **Shared Folder Management:** Securing access and permissions for shared directories.
*   **Service Security:** Ensuring that system services are configured and run securely.
*   **Password Crack:** The process of discovering passwords, often for malicious intent.
*   **UMASK:** (UNIX/Linux) A command/setting that controls the default file and directory permissions for newly created files.
*   **Daemon:** (UNIX/Linux) A background process that performs system tasks, often without user interaction.
*   **Anonymous FTP:** A File Transfer Protocol (FTP) configuration that allows users to access files without a specific username and password. Often less secure.
*   **Secure FTP (SFTP):** A secure version of FTP that uses SSH to encrypt data transfers.

@ Application  of a two-way  cipher  algorithm
Data, such as personal  information,  should be encrypted  and decrypted  using a two-way  cipher algorithm.
Secure block cipher algorithms,  such as SEED, ARIA, and AES (Rijndael),  are generally  used.
Currently,  there are two cases when the secure block cipher algorithm  should be applied:  when data is saved in
plain text in the existing  database,  and when an insecure  cipher algorithm,  such as DES or 3-DES, is used.
+ When data stored is in plain text
When personal  information  is stored in plain text, it should be encrypted  and stored, using a 128-bit  or higher
secret key, and the used secret key should be stored in a separate  safe place.

@ Prior consultation  for encrypting  a database
All stakeholders  participating  in the project  should consult  on necessary  matters  in advance  to share necessary
information  in advance,  such as the database  to be encrypted  to apply the database  application  security,  the
applicable  environment,  the security  policy, etc., before applying  security  to the DB application.
@ Analyzing  the impact  of database  encryption
In this phase, the operational  server is monitored  and the impact on the application  and DBMS is analyzed,
before applying  security  to the database  application.
This phase is one of the most important  phases in applying  security  to database  applications.  Before applying
encryption  to the operating  system, it is necessary  to perform encryption  pre-diagnosis,  such as extracting
encryption  targets and encryption-related  SQL queries in advance,  running performance  tests on the test
system, etc. Overall, the DBMS and application  are analyzed  in order to analyze the impact on changes in
performance  and system  resources  after encryption.
+ Selecting  an encryption  target
The encryption  target should be determined  by searching  the tables and columns  of the entire operating
DBMS to extract  the columns  needing  to be encrypted.
+ Analyzing  query statements
The amount  of data extracted  when executing  query statements  and the time of query statement  execution
should be analyzed,  and the query statement  expected  to need optimization  should be selected,  by
extracting  all query statements  used in all operating  DBMS.
+ Analyzing  DBMS
The resources  used by the DBMS, such as CPU, memory,  and storage,  should be checked,  and the appropriate
level of additional  resources,  that are required  when applying  encryption,  should be calculated.
+ Analyzing  applications
The application  modules  that are affected  by the application  of encryption  should be extracted,  and the
