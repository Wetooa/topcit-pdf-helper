        *   **Open API (Application Programming Interface):** For accessing various services and enabling data exchange.

#### D. Main IoT Protocols

IoT protocols must be lightweight, compatible, and scalable, especially for small devices connecting to the Internet.

1.  **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)**
    *   **Type:** Lightweight application layer protocol.
    *   **Developed by:** IETF CORE Working Group for object-to-object communication.
    *   **Transport Layer:** Uses **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) over the IP layer.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Designed independently of lower layers, flexible for various networks/transport layers.
        *   Reduced message size to minimize endpoint load.
        *   Uses binary encoding for efficient encoding/decoding.
    *   **Usage:** Often used for endpoints communicating via Zigbee rather than fast Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

2.  **MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport)**
    *   **Type:** Publish-subscribe-based protocol.
    *   **Purpose:** Delivers lightweight messages.
    *   **Ideal for:** Low speed, high-latency, and unreliable networks.

>p> Recent  trends and issues
As high-speed  data transmission  becomes  possible  and various  convergence  technologies  emerge,  cutting-
edge technologies  are also appearing  in the network  field. With the advent  of technologies  that guarantee
traffic quality in Internet networks, multimedia  and Internet  telephony  services  have been launched.  In
recent years, loT network-based  technologies  are expanding  together  with standardization  organizations
and groups. Moreover,  software-based  networks,  differentiated  from the existing  network  structure,  are
being introduced.  This chapter  discusses  the recent  network  trends and major issues.

# Practical  preview
Network  technologies  are changing  with new technologies,  such as loT, artificial intelligence  (Al), and cloud
computing.  The recent  topic of the new network  technology  is the software-defined network  (SDN). SDN
is a technology  for standardizing  software  that is dependent  on existing  hardware  manufacturers  and
providing  flexible network  services.  It is the core technology  of a software-defined  data center (SDDC).
Cloud computing  is another  core technology  of SDDC. As such, the network  is the infrastructure  and core
of new technologies.  Even in Al, the network  performance  determines  the Al performance.  Therefore,  the
A\ network  uses InfiniBand,  which is a short word for infinite bandwidth.  The existing  network  Ethemet  can
communicate  with one device at a time, but InfiniBand  can simultaneously  handle communication  between
multiple  devices. It can reliably  operate,  even if there is a problem  with some equipment.  This section
discusses  new network  technologies  that have recently  become  a hot topic.

01 loT Network-Based  Technology
A) loT concept
loT (Internet  of Things)  is a concept  that embeds  sensors  and communication  functions  in various  objects  to connect
to the Intemet.  It refers to the technology  that can perform  sensing,  networking,  and information  processing,  through
cooperation,  without  explicit human intervention.  At the same time, the ubiquitous  technology  that allows access
to information  and communication  networks,  regardless  of time and place as a concept  that exists anywhere  at the
same time and is ubiquitous  and the machine-to-machine  (M2M) technology  that enables  intelligent  communication
between  objects  have evolved  further. As such, loT enables all things to exchange  information  through  the Internet,
without  boundaries  between  people  and objects.

B) loT standardization  trend
3GPP and ETSI have established  mobile communication-based  loT standards,  but since 2012, they have been led
by an international  consultative  body called, oneM2M.  The Open Mobile  Alliance  (OMA) proposed  a communication
method,  based on a server-client  structure,  by establishing  the Lightweight  M2M (LWM2M)  protocol.  oneM2M  has
released  LWM2M,  which applies CoAP (Constrained  Application  Protocol)  and HTTP for data transfer,  as the latest
standard.

C) Core loT technologies
loT’s main technologies  are a sensing  technology,  a wired and wireless  communication  and network  infrastructure
technology,  and an loT service  and interface  technology.
@ Sensing  technology
Sensors  collect object information.  Various sensors, such as temperature,  humidity,  heat, gas, illuminance,  and
ultrasonic  waves, are installed  in the object  to obtain information  about  the surrounding  situation.  Sensors  are needed
to minimize  power consumption  in order to operate  for a long time. Physical  sensors  have evolved  into smart sensors
with a standardized  interface and information  processing  capability,  and they include  a virtual sensing  function  that
extracts  specific information  from the sensed data. As the sensor layer's role has increased,  the hardware  platform
market  is evolving  to facilitate  connec...
