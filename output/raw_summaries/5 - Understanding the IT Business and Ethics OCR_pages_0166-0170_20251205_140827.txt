# IT Business & Ethics Learning Guide

## 1. Fintech

Fintech (Financial Technology) represents a shift where non-financial companies use IT to provide financial services.

### Key Attributes of Fintech:
*   **Convenience**
*   **Ease**
*   **Simplicity**

### Types of Fintech Services:
*   **Payment Service:** Enables easy money transfers and payments, often linked with credit cards and bank accounts.
*   **Digital Currency:** Virtual currency (like Bitcoin) exchangeable with real currency, accepted globally for goods/services.
*   **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Lending:** Connects investors with borrowers, addressing limitations of traditional bank loans.
*   **Financial Software:** Enhances financial convenience using Big Data analysis, algorithms, and AI.

### Challenges for Domestic Fintech Industry:
*   Slow growth compared to overseas markets.
*   Few independent businesses without financial institution partnerships.
*   Numerous financial-related regulations.
*   **Government Role:** Needs to strengthen and impartially enforce regulations to energize the industry and generate value.

## 2. O2O (Online to Offline) and O4O (Online for Offline)

### O2O (Online to Offline)
*   **Concept:** Customers first check goods/services in offline stores (showrooming), then pay for them online.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Baedal People:** Order and pay for food online, receive food offline.
    *   **Kakao Taxi:** Book a taxi via a mobile app, take a real taxi offline.
    *   **Wahome:** Pay online for room and house cleaning services.

### O4O (Online for Offline)
*   **Concept:** Expands business operations from online to offline. An online service provider leverages its online value to operate an offline business, driving market innovation.
*   **Example: Amazon Go**
    *   An offline mart selling groceries.
    *   **How it works:** Customers activate a mobile app, log in, take items, and leave. Amazon automatically settles the bill through their registered account (requires Amazon Prime) and sends a receipt.
    *   **Benefit:** Eliminates waiting in line at counters and the need for packing.
    *   This is a clear O4O case where an online company (Amazon) uses its strengths for offline customer convenience.

## 3. Virtual Currency

### Definitions:
*   **Digital Currency:** Any currency represented in electronic form (can include legal tender).
*   **Virtual Currency:** A digital currency *not* represented in legal currency (e.g., loyalty points, game currency).
*   **Cryptocurrency:** A method of authenticating virtual currency using a distributed ledger and encryption (e.g., Bitcoin).
*   **General Definition:** Digital or electronic currency used in a virtual network space without physical bills or coins.
*   **Expert Definition (ECB, U.S. Treasury):** A type of digital currency issued and managed by developers, not government-controlled, used for payment in specific virtual communities. Most cryptocurrencies are both digital and virtual currencies.

### Comparison with Cash and Digital Currency:

| Feature           | Cash            | Digital Currency      | Virtual Currency      |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Issuing Body**  | Central bank    | Financial institutions | None                  |
| **Amount Issued** | Central bank    | 1:1 with legal currency | Determined by algorithm |
| **Transaction**   | Issuing body    | Issuing body          | P2P network, DLTs     |
| **Currency Unit** | Legal currency  | Legal currency        | Independent unit      |
| **Convertibility**| Guaranteed      | Guaranteed            | Allowed, not guaranteed |
| **Price**         | Fixed           | Fixed                 | Changes (supply/demand)|

### Reasons for Virtual Currency Value Rise:
*   **Scarcity:** Fixed total issuance, and mining consumes physical resources.
*   **Network Effect:** Value increases as more people hold it simultaneously.
*   *Note:* Scarcity and network effects alone don't fully explain value.

### Is it True Currency?
*   **Currency Functions:** Storage of value, exchangeable, scale of value.
*   **Challenge:** Virtual currencies (like Bitcoin) have severe price volatility, preventing them from performing the "scale of value" function.
*   **Expert Opinion:** Virtual currency cannot displace a nation's legal currency.
*   **Beyond Payment:** Some virtual currencies (like Ethereum) can provide services beyond just payment, and the value of these services can increase the currency's price.

### Major Virtual Currencies:
*   Over 1,100 types exist, but **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** account for over 70% of market capitalization.
    *   **Bitcoin (2009):**
        *   First distributed ledger-based virtual currency.
        *   Closed blockchain structure, mainly for transactions.
        *   Transaction time: ~10 minutes.
    *   **Ethereum (2014):**
        *   Improved organic blockchain structure (compared to Bitcoin's closed one).
        *   Supports smart contracts and other services, not just currency.
        *   Transaction time: ~10 seconds.
    *   **Ripple (2009):**
        *   Developed for bank transfers and low-cost payment services.
        *   Immediate settlement reduces risk and uses optimal currency conversion rates, reducing fees.
        *   Used by banks and companies for foreign trades.
    *   **Litecoin (2011):**
        *   Technically similar to Bitcoin but with improved speed.
        *   Up to 4 times faster transaction speed and higher maximum mining volume.

## 4. Linked Data

### Definition:
*   A structured data model that supports an interconnected Web.
*   Identifies data on the Web using individual **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)** and assigns linked information to each URI.

### 4 Rules of Linked Data:
1.  **Use of URI:** Each individual object (not just documents) has its own URI.
2.  **Use of HTTP URI:** URIs are accessible via the HTTP protocol to enhance data access.
3.  **Use of RDF (Resource Description Framework):** Data is structured in a triple model (subject-predicate-object) to formally represent and link web data.
4.  **Assignment of Linked Information:** Makes the process of linking existing data on the Web easier.

### Usefulness of Linked Data:
*   **Reusable Data:** Data can be used via its URI, even if it's not one's own.
*   **Reduced Data Redundancy:** Helps check for existing data, eliminating duplicate information.
*   **Maximized Interoperability & Data Integration:**
    *   Issued as a semantic web standard, allowing it to be queried and used like a database.
    *   Free access and use enable data mash-ups (combining data from different sources).
*   **Network Effects:** Data expansion through linking leads to accelerated network effects.

## 5. Open Data

### Definition:
*   Data that anyone can freely use, reuse, and redistribute.

### Conditions for Open Data:
*   **Availability and Access:**
    *   Must be downloadable over the internet.
    *   Transformation of original data or production of new works should be possible at reasonable cost.
    *   Provided in a convenient, modifiable format.
*   **Reuse and Redistribution:**
    *   Must be reusable and redistributable, including when combined with other datasets.
*   **Universal Participation:**
    *   Everyone must be able to use, reuse, and redistribute the data.
    *   No restrictions on "commercial" or "non-commercial" use, or specific purposes (e.g., education).

## 6. Latest H/W-Centered IT Business Service: 3D Printing

### Definition:
*   A method of printing 3-dimensional objects using 3D digital data.
*   Also known as **additive manufacturing** because it builds structures by stacking layers of materials (powder, liquid, solid threads/wires/pellets).

### Why Manufacturers are Interested:
*   **Customized Production:** Suitable for producing small batches of diverse, customized products.
*   **Consumer Needs:** Improves manufacturing to quickly and easily customize products for diverse consumer demands.
*   **One-Person Manufacturing:** Enables individuals to make their own products.

### Impact and Benefits:
*   **Increased Individual/Small Manufacturer Share:** Increases the involvement of individuals and small manufacturers in manufacturing/distribution.
*   **Reprocessing Industry Development:** Drives the development of industries focused on commercializing 3D-printed products.
*   **Blurred Boundaries:** Collapses the traditional separation between consumption and manufacturing, meeting small, everyday manufacturing needs (e.g., 3D-printed Button 2.0 with earphone wire grooves).

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
The main attributes  of fintech  are convenience,  ease, and simplicity.  Fintech  is proof that the paradigm  of financial  industry  has
changed  and now we are in an era where non-financial  companies  armed with IT technologies  are providing  IT services.  The
types of fintech  services  provided  by companies  are described  in the table below.

In overseas,  the fintech industry  is growing  by leaps and bounds.  But the domestic  fintech industry  has failed to fully
blossom,  although  a market around mobile payment  settlement  services  and P2P loan services  has been formed.
There are many difficulties  to the growth of the domestic  fintech industry  because  there are only a few kinds of
businesses  that could be started  independently  without a partnership  between  financial institutions  and many
financial-related  regulations.  There are also too many regulations.  The government  needs to strengthen  regulations
and enforce  them in an impartial  manner  so that the fintech industry  could be energized  and generate  added values.
@® 020 online to offline) andO40(Online  for Offline)
020 is the counterpart  to the showrooming  phenomenon  where customers  would first check the goods in offline
stores such as marts and department  stores and then pay for the same product  in online space. In other words, it
describes  the behavior  of paying  for goods online and receiving  the good or service  in offline space.
<Table87>Examples  of 020 services
Example Description
Baedal People + Aservice  for ordering  and paying for food online and receiving  the food offline.  The most
representative  O20 service.
Kakao  Taxi + Service  for booking  a taxi through  the mobile app and take a real taxi offline.
Wahome + Users pay online for room and house cleaning  services.

040 means “Online for Offline” It means expanding  the scope of business  operations  from online to offline. An 040
service provider  drives market innovation  by operating  an offline business  by leveraging  the value provided to its
customers  online.
Amazon  Go is a shocking  example  that illustrates  the value and meaning  of O40. Why did Amazon  Go, an offline mart
that sells simple groceries  and miscellaneous  goods send such shockwaves  to the offline mart market?
To use Amazon  Go, customers  must activate  a mobile app and then log in. And then they just have to bring their
purchases  out of the store. Amazon  Go automatically  settles the bill through  the customer's  account  information
and delivers  the receipts  to the customer.  Of course,  customers  must be registered  with Amazon  Prime before using
Amazon  Go.
Customers  don't have to wait in line at the counter  to pay and don't have to go through  the process  of putting  the
goods on the counter  and packing  them in a grocery  bag. This is a very clear-cut  case O40 where an online company
leverages  their strengths  for customer  convenience.
© Virtual currency  or virtual money
In recent years, interest in cryptocurrency  has been hot due to the surge in the adoption  of crypto currencies  like
Bitcoin and Ethereum.  While under the strict definition,  it is correct  to call Bitcoin and Ethereum  cryptocurrencies,  the
term virtual currency  is often used instead.
