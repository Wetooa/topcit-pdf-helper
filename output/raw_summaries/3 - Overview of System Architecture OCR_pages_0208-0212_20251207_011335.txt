### **1. VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**

*   **Definition:** Technology providing voice and data services over the LTE network. It delivers voice services in the next-generation wireless broadband network.
*   **Nature:** LTE is an **all-IP, data-only network**. VoLTE services are implemented as digital data.
*   **Services:** Transmits voice, text, video chat, and other multimedia content.
*   **Key Protocols/Architecture:**
    *   Uses **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)** for calling (standard for Internet telephony).
    *   Leverages the **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)** architecture to provide voice and text as data.

*   **Early Challenges (Before full LTE deployment):**
    *   Incomplete LTE infrastructure.
    *   Difficulty transmitting voice over older WCDMA/GSM networks freely.
    *   Lack of standardized roaming and interconnection agreements between LTE and 3G networks, preventing seamless communication.

*   **Solutions to Early Challenges:**
    1.  **Circuit-Switched Fallback (CSFB):**
        *   Initially, calls were established primarily over WCDMA/GSM circuit networks.
        *   Minimal roaming between LTE terminals and older networks.
        *   *Note: Multimedia communication was not supported at this stage.*
    2.  **3GPP MMTel (Multimedia Telephony):**
        *   An evolution allowing multimedia communication once LTE network coverage matured.

### **2. Media Transport Protocols**

These protocols are designed for transmitting real-time media over the Internet.

*   **A) RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**
    *   **Purpose:** Processes and transmits real-time video or audio data over the Internet.
    *   **Transport Layer:** Operates over **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**.
    *   **Mechanism:** The sender compresses media (using a codec), converts it into RTP packets, and sends them via UDP.
    *   **Limitation:** UDP does not guarantee timely delivery or prevent packet loss. Applications must use RTP packet header information to handle this.
    *   **Quality & Sync:** **RTCP** is used to ensure **QoS (Quality of Service)** for RTP and synchronize media streams.
    *   **Standard:** Defined in IETF RFC 1889.

*   **B) RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol)**
    *   **Purpose:** Controls RTP sessions, managing the streaming of video or audio over the Internet.
    *   **Standard:** IETF standard, defined alongside RTP in RFC 1889.
    *   **Packet Types:** Includes sender report, receiver report, source description, bye message, and application-specific packets.

*   **C) RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)**
    *   **Purpose:** An application layer protocol for transmitting real-time media. Its main function is to *control* streaming media servers remotely.
    *   **Commands:** Similar to VCR controls (e.g., "PLAY," "PAUSE").
    *   **Data Transmission:** Most RTSP servers use **RTP** for the actual audio/video data transfer at the transport layer.
    *   **Standard:** IETF RFC 2326 (1998).

    *   Improve cost-effectiveness by utilizing general Internet technology.
    *   Enable easy integration with third-party applications.
    *   Efficient session management and global service linking for business expansion.

*   **Network Structure (Logical All-IP Network Domains):**
    1.  Radio Network Domain
    2.  GPRS-based Packet-Switching Service Domain
    3.  **IP Multimedia Service Domain (IMS)**
*   **Key Components of the IMS Service Domain:**
    *   **CSCF (Call Session Control Function):** Registers and processes multimedia calls using SIP.
    *   **HSS (Home Subscriber Server):** Integrates the legacy mobile network's HLR (Home Location Register) with IP multimedia user mobility management and authentication functions.

D) VoLTE (Voice over LTE)
VoLTE is a technology  that provides  data and voice through  the LTE network.  It provides  voice services  in the LTE
environment,  the next-generation  wireless  broadband  network  technology.
Although  VoLTE refers to the voice service domain, since LTE technology  is based on an all-IP- data-only  network,
the VoLTE service is implemented  in the form of digital data. Therefore,  it transmits  voice, text, video chat, and
multimedia  content  in the SIP, which is the main calling solution  for Internet  telephony  services.  It provides  voice and
text services,  which exist as data, through  the IMS (IP multimedia  subsystem)  architecture.
These VoLTE technology  solutions  were not implemented  flawlessly  at the beginning.  It was because  the LTE
infrastructure  was not yet fully equipped,  so voice services  could not be transmitted  over the WCDMA/GSM  networks
freely. The problem  was that while roaming  and interconnection  were required between  LTE and 3G networks  to
provide seamless  communication  services,  there was no standard  agreement  on roaming  and interconnection
between  new and old networks.  The following  two steps can be considered  to resolve  the problem.
Firstly, the circuit-switched  fallback solution establishes  calls, mainly over the WCDMA/GSM  circuit network,  and
LTE terminal  vendors  and mobile telecommunication  carriers perform minimal roaming.  However,  multimedia
communication  service is not implemented  at this stage.
Secondly,  if the coverage  is established  to some extent after the initial stage of LTE network  construction,  it evolves
into the stage of implementing  a multimedia  communication  service, through  an appropriate  solution,  such as 3GPP
MMTel (Multimedia  Telephony).
[Figure 145] shows how VoLTE services  are implemented  over 3G networks.

03 Media Transport  Protocols
Media transport  protocols  include RTP (Real-Time  Transport  Protocol),  RTCP (Real-Time  Control Protocol),  and RTSP
(Real-Time  Streaming  Protocol).  RTP is designed  to process  real-time  traffic over the Internet.  It is mainly used to
transmit  video or audio data in real time over the Internet.  RTCP is a protocol  to control  the RTP (Real-time  Transport
Protocol)  for streaming  video or audio over the Internet.  RTP and RTCP are specified  in the IETF standard  document
RFC 1889. RTSP is designed  for use in entertainment  and communication  systems  to control streaming  media
servers, RTP is used to establish  and control media sessions  between  endpoints,  and it does not actually  transmit
media streaming  data. Most RTSP servers transfer  actual audio/video data to the transport layer, using the RTP
protocol.
A) RTP
RTP is designed  to process  real-time  traffic over the Internet.  It is mainly used to transmit  video or audio data in real
time over the Internet.  It is performed  over the UDP (user datagram  protocol)  of the transport  layer.
In the RTP protocol,  the transmitting  side that sends the media file, converts  the media unit data compressed  with
the codec into an RTP packet and sends it to the receiving  side, using UDP. Since it is transmitted  using UDP RTP
does not guarantee  that packets  are delivered  within a specified  time and are not lost. Therefore,  the video and audio
applications  must process  packets,  using information  included  in the RTP packet  header. RTCP can ensure the QoS of
RTP and synchronization  of media streams.
B) RTCP
RTCP controls  RTP, a protocol  for streaming  video or audio over the Internet.  It is an IETF standard  defined  together
with RTP in RFC 1889. RTCP packet  types include  the sender  report packet,  receiver  report packet, source  description
message,  bye message,  and application-specific  packet.
C) RTSP
RTSP is an application  layer protocol that transmits  real-time  media. The communication  protocol developed  by
IETF in 1998 is defined in RFC 2326. It is a communication  protocol  for transmitting  and receiving  audio and moving
pictures  in real time,as  well as a standard  protocol  for controlling  streaming  data on the Internet.  It is used to remotely
control media servers. Its commands  are similar  to VCR operations,  such as "PLAY" and "PAUSE",  and it accesses  the
server, based on time information.
D) IMS.
IMS was first proposed  by the 3GPP (3rd Generation  Partnership  Project)  group that develops  international  standards
in the wireless  communication  field. It is an infrastructure  for providing  IP multimedia  services  and uses SIP protocol-
based call control as a core technology.
