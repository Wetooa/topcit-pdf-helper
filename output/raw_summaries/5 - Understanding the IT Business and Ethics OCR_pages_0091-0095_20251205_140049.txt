### 2. SCM Deployment Effects

*   **Goal:** Real-time information linkage between customer, company, and component suppliers.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Inventory:** Significant reduction in supply stock (e.g., Dell reduced from 8 weeks to 12-15 days).
    *   **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Increased delivery capacity, reduced order processing time, strict adherence to schedules.
    *   **Reduced Logistics Costs.**
    *   **Improved Fund Flow Efficiency:** Standardized work, reduced product delivery and order processing times.

### 3. Understanding CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

*   **Definition:** A management strategy system to understand customer tendencies and requirements, enabling product creation and effective marketing strategies.
*   **Why CRM is Essential Today:**
    *   Customers have more product/service knowledge.
    *   Higher customer expectations and churn rates.
    *   Businesses need customer-centric structures, diverse interaction channels, and profit-driven customer management.
*   **Method:** Enterprises analyze customer behavior and consumption patterns, consolidating internal/external data to derive insights (e.g., using Big Data).

#### Customer Life Cycle in CRM

CRM helps manage customers through stages to maximize their **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – the total value generated throughout their relationship, not just individual transactions.
*   **Potential Customer:** Shows initial interest.
*   **Responsive Customer:** Reacts to marketing efforts.
*   **Purchasing Customer:** Buys products.
*   **High-Value Customer:** Highly loyal and profitable.
*   **Low-Value Customer:** Less profitable or loyal.
*   **Lost Customer:** No longer engaging with the business.
*   **Forced-Departure Customer:** The company terminates interaction.

#### Definition of CRM (Gartner)
*   **Core Idea:** A strategy to optimize sales and expand the customer base by creating and supporting relationships with profitable customers.
*   **Process:** Integrates and analyzes customer data (internal and external) to provide findings to customer contact points, enabling effective interactions. This ensures customers receive desired products/services based on accurate understanding, maximizing CLV and profitability.

#### CRM Classification

CRM is typically classified into three types for better understanding:

1.  **Analysis CRM:**
    *   **Concept:** Gathers and analyzes data from customer interactions to derive meaningful insights for the enterprise. Often linked to a **Data Warehouse (DW)**.
    *   **Components:** Enterprise-wide DW, Data Mining, OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).
    *   **Considerations:** Providing analysis techniques to identify customer needs, building a knowledge base, ensuring data reliability.

2.  **Operational CRM:**
    *   **Concept:** Uses insights from Analysis CRM to support customer management at contact points, integrating marketing, service, and sales activities. Automates front-office business processes.
    *   **Components:** Marketing information management, Campaign system, SFA (Sales Force Automation), Customer service system.
    *   **Considerations:** Integrating processes across channels, unified management of customer contact history, rapid development of business functions, access to back-office systems.

3.  **Collaboration CRM:**
    *   **Concept:** Manages customer interaction channels. Facilitates improved communication and task consolidation between customers, the company, and internal departments.
    *   **Components:** Call Center, Mobile collaboration system, eCRM (electronic CRM).
    *   **Considerations:** Diversifying channels, providing a uniform service across all channels.

*   **Overall Goal:** While categorized for understanding, CRM's ultimate aim is to deeply understand customer minds, requiring robust data analysis, business support systems, and diverse interaction channels.

#### Configuration of the CRM System

*   **Information Flow:** Starts and ends at the **customer point of contact (channel)**.
*   **Role of Channels:** Collects **VoC (Voice of Customer)** and communicates internal process results back to the customer. This makes channels crucial for identifying CRM components.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Customer Data Warehouse:** Central storage for all customer data; used by all CRM elements.
    *   **OLAP & Data Mining:** Tools for diverse customer analysis, identifying relationships, and supporting decision-making (e.g., customer acquisition).
    *   **Campaign System:** Develops tailored services and recommends profitable business directions.
    *   **Channel System:** Provides 1:1 or 1:N marketing support (e.g., call centers, email, direct mail).
    *   **Sales Force Automation (SFA):** Supports sales staff with planning, management, performance evaluation, and direct sales activities.
    *   **Customer Service System:** Uses VoC for customer service and product maintenance (A/S).

#### Effects of CRM Deployment

*   **Improved Customer Relationships:** Increases loyalty and prevents customer churn.
*   **High-Quality Services:** Provides tailored services by analyzing customer tastes.
*   **Increased Sales:** Induces linked sales and upstream sales.
*   **Competitive Edge:** Builds differentiated policies for products and services based on customer insights.

### 4. Understanding PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)

*   **Definition:** A solution that uniformly manages a product's entire lifecycle, from design drawings to final product and post-sales services.
*   **Goal:** Increase product added value and reduce costs throughout the process.
*   **Detailed Definition:** A support system that integrates and manages all product-related information (drawings, documents, CAD/CAM, parts, design changes, process information) generated across the enterprise's product development and manufacturing lifecycle.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   PLM includes not only initial product planning but also **post-sales services** provided to customers.
    *   Its key role is managing an individual product's complete cycle from planning to sale.
    *   Requires organic support from other work support systems.
    *   Visualizing the product's entire life cycle helps understand PLM components.

management.
@ SCM deployment  effects
Dell Computer,  the most successful  company  in introducing  SCM, said that after adopting  SCM it became  possible  to
link information  between  customer,  company,  and component  suppliers  in real time, and reduced  its inventory  from 8
weeks’  worth of supplies  to 12 ~ 15 days’ worth of supplies.
+ The introduction  of supply chain management  can improve  customer  satisfaction  by increasing  transportation
delivery  capacity and reducing  inventory,  reduce logistics  costs, and reducethe  customer  order processing  time
through  strict adherence  to delivery  schedules.
+ It can also improve  the efficiency  of fund flow by standardizing  work and by reducing  the product  delivery  time and
the order processing  time.
F) Understanding  CRM
CRM stands for customer  relationship  management.  It is a management  strategy  system for studying  customers’
tendencies  and requirements  in advance  in order to create the products  that customers  want and to develop
marketing  strategies.
Because  today’s customers’  knowledge  of product  and service information  has vastly increased  and customer
expectations  and customer  churn are higher than ever before, enterprises  are compelled  to establish  new business
management  strategies,  such as adopting  a customer-centric  corporate  structure,  establishing  diverse customer
interface  channels,  and implementing  customer  management  that leads to better  earnings.
To implement  these strategies,  enterprises  must analyze  customer  behavior  patterns  and consumption  patterns.  In
recent  years, enterprises  have felt the need to consolidate  internal/external  data and analyze  markets  and customers
to derive insights.  Big Data analysis  is a good example  of this.

+ Enterprises  can gain opportunities  to acquire new customers  through  focused marketing  or promotional  activities
that target responsive  customers  among potential  customers  in the target market who show interest  in their
products.
+ Enterprises  should strategically  manage  customers  who purchase  their products  as well as high-value  (highly loyal)
customers.  To this end, enterprises  should have a system in place that can sort their customers  based on such
criteria  as personality,  type, and interests,  and provide  their services  and conduct  their marketing  accordingly.
+ This requires  an entity to establish  a strategy  for maximizing  customer  lifetime  value, i.e. the total value generated
throughout  the customer's  lifecycle, rather than the temporary  profitability generated  by individual  transactions.
This is the goal of CRM.
© Definition  of CRM
The CRM defined by Gartner  is ‘a strategy  for optimizing corporate  sales and expanding  the customer  base by
creating  and supporting  relationships with profitable  customers.  In other words, CRM is a management  technique
that integrates  and analyzes  customer  data across the enterprise  and customer-related  data inside and outside  the
enterprise,  and then provides  the findings  to customer  points of contact  for use in interactions  with the customers.
This is an integrated  process  that enables  enterprises  to continually  deliver the products  and services  customers
want, based on an accurate  understanding  of the customers,  thereby  maximizing  customer  lifetime value and
increasing  profitability.
