## Learning Guide: System Architecture Overview

This guide covers the fundamental structure of information systems, including hardware and software components, and introduces challenges in system capacity planning.

---

### 1. Information System Structure

Information systems are structured in various ways. A common modern approach is the **3-Tier Web System Architecture**, which divides the system into **physical areas (hardware)** and **program areas (software)**.

**Key Components of a 3-Tier Web System Architecture:**

*   **Client:** User's device (e.g., web browser) interacting with the system.
*   **Webserver:** Handles web requests (e.g., HTTP), serves static content.
*   **Application Server:** Processes business logic and dynamic content requests.
*   **Database Server:** Manages and stores data.

---

### 2. Information System Hardware Structure (Physical Domain)

The most fundamental hardware component is the **server**, which runs application programs. Other devices like storage and backup disks are added as needed.

#### 2.1 Server Classification by Performance:

Servers are categorized by their processing power and cost:

*   **Entry Server:**
    *   **Cost:** Relatively lower (e.g., millions of won).
    *   **CPU:** 1-2 CPUs per socket.
    *   **Use:** Typically for web servers or application servers.
*   **Middle-range Server:**
    *   **Cost:** Medium (e.g., tens of millions of won).
    *   **CPU:** 4+ CPUs per socket.
    *   **Use:** For database servers or enterprise servers (not considered high-end).
*   **High-end Server:**
    *   **Cost:** Very expensive (e.g., hundreds of millions to billions of won).
    *   **CPU:** Tens of CPUs per socket.
    *   **Use:** Mostly for critical database servers or enterprise servers.

#### 2.2 Server Classification by Configuration:

Servers are also classified by their physical design:

*   **Rack-mount Server:**
    *   **Design:** Fits into standardized racks (steel frames) in data centers or server rooms.
    *   **Sizes:** Standardized (e.g., 1U, 2U, 4U for 19-inch racks).
    *   **Connectivity:** Power, network, and SAN switch connected separately.
*   **Tower Server:**
    *   **Design:** Similar to a general personal computer (PC).
    *   **Use:** For in-house server rooms, offices, or stores. Low-noise versions are available for office environments.
*   **Blade Server:**
    *   **Design:** Maximizes capacity in minimal space. Multiple CPU blades plug into a single frame.
    *   **Integration:** Server and network components are integrated into a compact unit.
    *   **Advantage:** High density, allowing more servers in the same space compared to rack-mount.

#### 2.3 Storage:

*   Provides large storage space, high performance, and high availability.
*   Classified as enterprise or mid-range based on processing capacity.

### 3. Information System Software Structure (Program Domain)

This domain comprises various software components that enable the system to function.

*   **Operating System (OS):**
    *   **Definition:** System software that manages the application platform and provides an interface between applications and hardware.
    *   **Server OS Examples:** Linux, UNIX (BSD, Solaris), Windows.
    *   **Market Trend:** Linux and UNIX are dominant in the server market, unlike the desktop market (Windows).

*   **Webserver:**
    *   **Definition:** Delivers web content (HTML, text, images, video) to web clients (browsers).
    *   **Protocol:** Uses HTTP.
    *   **Examples:** Apache, Nginx, IIS.

*   **Web Application Server (WAS):**
    *   **Definition:** Middleware that ensures stable transaction processing for web client requests and supports distributed systems. It acts as an engine for database queries and business logic.
    *   **Functions:** Supports component development, application development, web, distributed objects, security, system management, and legacy system interfaces.
    *   **Examples:** Tomcat, Jetty, JEUS, JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere, Node.js.

*   **Transaction Processing (TP) Monitor:**
    *   **Definition:** Transaction management middleware for distributed transaction processing. It monitors transactions (minimum processing units) to maintain consistency across various sessions and systems.
    *   **Standard:** Most products comply with the X/Open DTP (Distributed Transaction Process) model.
    *   **Examples:** Tmax, Tuxedo.

*   **DB Server (Database Management System - DBMS):**
    *   **Definition:** Manages and provides access to structured data. It's a large-scale, consolidated storage system designed for minimum duplication and concurrent use by multiple users.
    *   **Functions:** Ensures independence between application programs and data, and enables efficient data access through queries.
    *   **System Catalog:** A system table used by database administrators (DBAs) that lists definitions of all data objects in the database.
    *   **Examples:** Oracle, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Cubrid.

---

### 4. Information System Capacity Calculation

*   **Challenge:** Hardware sizing is often inaccurate because it relies on past experience rather than a detailed analysis of business needs, load increase rates, and user frequency.
*   **Problem:** Despite hardware being a significant portion of total project costs, its sizing often receives less attention than software development. This can lead to inappropriate hardware sizes and system performance issues.

B) Information  system  structure
There are several types of structures  for an information  system.  A web system architecture  and a client-server
system architecture  are leading  examples.  The most recent information  systems  are generally  composed  of a 3-tier
web system architecture,  and these information  systems  can be divided into physical areas (hardware)  and program
areas (software),  as shown in [Figure 76], from a structural  viewpoint.

@ Information  system hardware  structure  (Physical  domain)
A server is the most fundamental  component  required  when implementing  an information  system,  and devices,such
as storage  and backup disks, are added and configured  as needed.  A server is a hardware  platform  that runs server
application  programs  and is classified  in various  ways, according  to performance  and type as follows.
* Classification  according  to performance
Classification Description
Entry serverAn entry server, typically  priced in millions  of won, is used by a webserver  or application  server.
It usually refers to a server  that can mount  one or two CPUs per socket.
Middle-range  serverA middle range server, typically  priced in tens of millions  of won, is used by a database  server  or
enterprise  server.
Servers  that can mount  four or more CPUs per socket,  and are not considered  high-end  servers,  are
called the middle-range  server.
High-end  serverA high-end  server  is a very expensive  server, typically  priced in hundreds  of millions  or billions of won. It is
mostly  used by a database  server  or enterprise  server.
It usually refers to a server  that can mount  tens of CPUs per socket.
* Classification  according  to the configuration
Classification
Rack-mount  serverDescription
A rack-mount  server  fits into a rack, which is a steel frame for storing  servers  or network  equipment.  It
is used in places where multiple  server/network  equipment  is placed, such as in a data center  or server
room. Rack-mount  server  sizes are standardized.  Standard  rack-mount  servers  are generally  1U, 2U, and
AU sized installed  in a 19-inch  rack. Power, network,  and SAN switch are separately  connected.
A tower server is installed  in an in-house  server room, an office, or a store. It is similar  to a general PC.
Tower  server When a tower server  is installed  in a space where people reside or work, such as an office or a store, a
low-noise  server, developed  for office installation,  may be a good option.
A blade server  maximizes  capacity  while minimizing  the size, by plugging  several CPU blades into a
Badeeenen frame. The server  and network  are reduced  and integrated  into a box, and the operating  system  is pre-
installed.  The biggest  advantage  of blade servers  is their small size. A blade server  can be more densely
integrated  than a rack-mount  server in the same space.
Storage  is classified  into enterprise  or mid-range  storage,  according  to processing  capacity,  It provides  a large storage
space, high performance,  and high availability,  compared  to general  disk arrays.
[Figure 77] below shows an example  of an information  system hardware  configuration,  using a server  and various
devices.  A system architecture  or technical  architecture  design describes  its details.

+ OS: An OS is defined as system software  that operates  and manages  an application  platform  and that provides
an interface  between  an application  program  and the platform.  The OS for the server includes  Linux, UNIX (BSD,
Solaris, etc.), Windows,  and macOS.  The OS for the server  market  is quite different  from the desktop  market,  which
is dominated  by Windows.  Linux and UNIX are the most widely used OS, followed  by Windows.  UNIX servers have
replaced  most mainframes,  and they were followed  by Linux, which is a UNIX-like  OS.
