## Learning Guide: Project Management & Technical Communication - Quality & Risk

### 1. Quality Evaluation Perspective

Quality evaluation can be viewed from two main perspectives:

*   **Product Quality:**
    *   Evaluates the functionality and reliability of the final product.
    *   **Common Standards:** ISO/IEC 9126, 6 Sigma.
*   **Process Quality:**
    *   Evaluates if a process is well-defined and properly followed, based on the idea that "a good product comes from a good process."
    *   **Common Standards:** ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 12207, CMMI.

### 2. Quality Standards

#### A) ISO/IEC 9126 (now ISO/IEC 25000-2)

*   **Purpose:** A quality model for defining and evaluating software product quality characteristics from the user's point of view.
*   **Components:**
    *   **9126-1:** Defines 6 quality characteristics and 21 sub-characteristics, helping stakeholders evaluate software quality.
    *   **9126-2 (External metrics):** Measures external properties visible during use, focusing on the final product from user/manager perspective.
    *   **9126-3 (Internal metrics):** Measures internal software properties of interim products during development stages.
    *   **9126-4 (Quality in use metrics):** Measures if goals for efficiency, productivity, safety, and satisfaction are met when using finished software.

#### B) ISO 12207

*   **Purpose:** A standard for software processes across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), providing guidelines for systematic acquisition, supply, development, operation, and maintenance.
*   **Key Life Cycle Processes:**
    *   **Acquisition:** Activities for organizations acquiring systems/software.
    *   **Supply:** Activities for organizations supplying systems/software.
    *   **Development:** Activities for organizations building software products.
    *   **Operation:** Activities for organizations running information systems in a real environment.
    *   **Maintenance:** Activities for organizations providing maintenance services for software products.
*   **Framework:** Consists of three main life cycle processes: Primary, Supporting, and Organizational, with 20 subprocesses.

#### C) ISO 25000

*   **Purpose:** An integrated software quality evaluation model, combining existing standards (like ISO 14598, 9126) and new developments.
*   **Divisions:**
    *   Quality Management
    *   Quality Model
    *   Quality Requirements
    *   Quality Evaluation

#### D) CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

*   **Purpose:** Provides guidance to improve an organization's processes and capabilities in developing, acquiring, and maintaining software. Measures the maturity of a software development organization.
*   **Maturity Levels:**
    *   **Level 1 (Initial):** Processes are unpredictable; performance is difficult to forecast.
    *   **Level 2 (Managed):** Basic processes are established and managed at the project level.
    *   **Level 3 (Defined):** Standardized, detailed processes are defined and used across the organization.
    *   **Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed):** Project performance is quantitatively managed and controlled; performance can be predicted.
    *   **Level 5 (Optimizing):** Focus on continuous process improvement; projects are carried out with optimal management.

#### E) SPICE (ISO 15504)

*   **Purpose:** A model that evaluates software life cycle processes in two dimensions: organizational software process maturity and improvement capability.
*   **Process Groups:**
    *   **Primary Process (Customer-Supplier, Engineering):** Covers acquisition, supply, demand creation, operation, system/software development, and maintenance.
    *   **Supporting Process (Support):** Includes documentation, configuration management, quality assurance, verification/validation, and audit.
    *   **Organizational Process (Organization):** Involves organizational improvement, manpower management, and measurement tools/reuse.

#### F) Comparison of Software Process Audit & Certification Systems

| Feature             | SP Certification (Korea)      | CMMI (Overseas - US)             | SPICE (Overseas - International) |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Standard Type**   | Domestic standard             | Market standard                  | International standard           |
| **Characteristic**  | Organizational maturity       | Organizational maturity          | Process maturity                 |
| **Model**           | Staged model                  | Staged, Continuous model         | Continuous model                 |
| **Rating (Levels)** | Three levels (Level 1-3)      | Five levels (Level 1-5)          | Six levels (Level 0-5)           |
| **Process Focus**   | Project, development, support, organizational, improvement | Process Mgmt, Project Mgmt, Engineering, Support | Depends on Process Reference Model |
| **Validity Period** | Three years                   | Three years                      | Unlimited                        |

### 3. Risk Management Overview

*   **Importance:** Essential for systematic and effective business management, especially for project success and sustainable growth. Requires integrated management.
*   **Risk Management Process:**
    1.  Risk Management Planning
    2.  Risk Identification
    3.  Qualitative Risk Analysis
    4.  Quantitative Risk Analysis
    5.  Risk Response Planning
    6.  Risk Control
*   **Negative Risk Response Strategies (Threats):**
    *   **Avoid:** Eliminate the threat.
    *   **Transfer:** Shift the risk (e.g., insurance).
    *   **Mitigate:** Reduce impact or probability.
    *   **Acceptance:** Acknowledge and deal with the risk if it occurs.
*   **Positive Risk Response Strategies (Opportunities):**
    *   **Exploit:** Ensure the opportunity occurs.
    *   **Share:** Partner to capture the opportunity.
    *   **Enhance:** Increase probability or impact.
    *   **Acceptance:** Acknowledge and capitalize on the opportunity if it arises.

03 Quality Evaluation  Perspective  and Quality  Standard
A) Quality  evaluation  perspective
Quality  evaluation  perspective  can be divided into product  quality  and process  quality.
@ Product  Quality
It is technique that evaluates  the functionality  and reliability  of a product  made by a project, and ISO/IEC  9126
and 6 Sigma are the most common  quality  standards.
@ Process  Quality
It is a technique  that evaluates  whether  a process is defined and properly  operated  from the viewpoint  that
a good product  comes from a good process,  and ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 12207, and CMMI are widely used quality
standards,
B) Quality  standard
@ ISO/IEC  9126 (currently  known as ISO/IEC  25000-2)
It is a quality model created  through  standardization  on software  quality characteristics  from the  user's point
of view by ISO(International  Organization  for Standardization),  an international  standardization  organization,  as
a specific  definition  for standardization  and quality assurance  of quality  characteristics  and metrics  is required.

It refers to the external  properties  that appear  while in use, and measures  the final product,  which is the
closing  stage of software,  from the user’s and manager's  point of view
ISO 9126-3[Internal  metrics]
Interim products  are measured  by creating  a measurement  table for each evaluation  factor by
development  stage based on internal software  properties

The following  is an acquisition/management  process  framework  among  SW standard  processes  for acquisition
and managing  public projects  based on ISO/IEC 12207. The acquisition/management  process  framework  is a
system that defines  basic activities  in the entire life cycle for software  introduction,  and procedures  and activ-
ities for performing  basic activities  from a managerial  and engineering  perspective.  The framework  consists  of
three life cycle processes:  primary:  supporting  and organizational,  and 20 subprocesses.
