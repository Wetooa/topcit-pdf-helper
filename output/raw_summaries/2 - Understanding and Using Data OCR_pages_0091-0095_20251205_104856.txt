## Learning Guide: Database Views & Distributed Databases

### Part 1: Database Views

**1. View Creation**
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of a SQL query. It's created from an existing table.

*   **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW View_name
    [(column_name [,column_name...])]
    [WITH ENCRYPTION]
    AS select_statement
    [WITH CHECK OPTION]
    ```

*   **`WITH CHECK OPTION`**: Ensures all data modifications made through the view comply with the `SELECT` statement's conditions that defined the view.
*   **`WITH ENCRYPTION`**: Prevents users from viewing the SQL text that defines the view. To decrypt, you must delete and recreate the view.

*   **Constraints on Views:**
    *   User needs `SELECT` privilege on the underlying tables.
    *   Cannot use `SELECT INTO` with a view.
    *   Cannot create a view on a temporary table.
    *   Cannot create triggers or indexes directly on a view.
    *   A view can refer to up to 250 columns.

**2. Modifying Data with a View**
A view does not store its own data. Updates to a view directly affect the original (base) table.

*   **Constraints for Data Modification through a View:**
    *   An update must affect only *one* original table.
    *   Columns with calculated values, built-in functions, or aggregation functions cannot be updated via a view.
    *   An error occurs if a view affects a table with a `NOT NULL` column, and no value is provided.
    *   Columns without an input value must have a default value defined or allow `NULL`.

**3. Other View Considerations**
*   **New Columns in Base Table:** If a new column is added to the original table after view creation, it will NOT automatically appear in the view.
*   **Modifying View Definition:** To change a view's definition, you must delete the existing view and recreate it.
*   **Deleting Base Table:** Deleting the original table does NOT automatically delete the view. The view must be manually deleted.

### Part 2: Distributed Databases

**1. Introduction to Distributed Databases**

*   **Definition:** A database system where data is physically stored across multiple computers on a network, but logically integrated and presented to users as a single, unified database.
*   **Distributed Database Management System (DDBMS):** A system that manages and coordinates information exchange between local databases to make multiple physical databases appear as one logical database.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Reduced Remote Data Dependence:** Local control over data.
    *   **Scalability:** Can process large data volumes beyond a single server; easily scale up by adding servers.
    *   **Improved Reliability & Availability:** If one site fails, only that site's data is unavailable, not the entire system.

*   **Shortcomings:**
    *   **Increased Complexity & Cost:** Distributed processing adds complexity, raising software development costs.
    *   **Weak Control Functions:** More challenging to implement centralized control.
    *   **Higher Error Possibility:** Increased chance of errors due to distributed nature.
    *   **Variable Response Speed:** Performance can depend on network conditions and physical data location.
    *   **Data Integrity Challenges:** Difficult to fully ensure data integrity across distributed sites.

**2. Data Transparency in Distributed Databases**
**Data Transparency** is the characteristic that allows users to access and manipulate data in a distributed database without needing to know its physical location or how it's accessed internally. Users perceive multiple physical databases as a single logical one.

*   **Types of Transparency:**
    *   **Partitioning Transparency:** Users don't need to know how the global schema (overall database structure) is split into smaller fragments. A user's query is automatically converted into queries for the relevant fragments.
        *   **Vertical Partitioning:** Splits a table into relations based on a subset of attributes (columns).
        *   **Horizontal Partitioning:** Splits a table into relations based on a subset of tuples (rows).
    *   **Location Transparency:** Users or applications don't need to know the physical location of data. They use the same commands regardless of where the data resides.
    *   **Replication Transparency:** Users don't need to know if data is duplicated or where redundant copies are stored. They perceive they are working with unique logical data.
    *   **Failure Transparency:** Data integrity is guaranteed even if a component (computer system or network) fails. Transactions maintain atomicity (all or nothing) despite failures.
    *   **Concurrency Transparency:** Ensures consistent results even when multiple transactions execute simultaneously. DDBMS typically uses locking and timestamp methods for this.

### Part 3: Data Quality & Standardization

**1. Importance of Data Quality**
Data quality (accuracy, consistency, timeliness) is critical due to expanding and complex information systems. It's an essential requirement for managing information systems, with organizations focusing on frameworks for data quality control.

*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Explain the concept of data quality.
    2.  Explain the concept of data standardization.
    3.  Design a standardized database using a dictionary.

*   **Keywords:**
    *   **Data quality:** Refers to the quality of data values, data structure, and data processing.
    *   **Data standardization:** Involves standardizing words, terms, codes, and domains.
    *   **Dictionary:** Includes word dictionaries, glossaries (term definitions), and domain dictionaries (valid value sets).

**2. Consequences of Poor Data Quality**
Deterioration in data quality leads to confusion and distrust.

*   **Problems:**
    *   Inconsistent results depending on who requests the data (e.g., different departments).
    *   Lack of trust in IT-provided information.
    *   Time and money wasted on fixing inaccurate data.
    *   Inability to guarantee data reliability, even with increased budget.
    *   Delayed decision-making due to inaccurate data.
    *   Difficulty understanding exact numbers for specific situations.

**3. Benefits of Good Data Quality Control**
Effective data quality management positively impacts the entire business and IT systems.

*   **Positive Effects:**
    *   Increased sales, improved productivity, larger market share.
    *   Higher customer satisfaction, better service quality, enhanced product competitiveness.
    *   Reduced business costs, IT costs, and rework expenses.
    *   Accident prevention, compliance with regulations, maintenance of market confidence.

**4. Why Database Quality Control and Standardization are Crucial**
As information systems grow, quality control and standardization become more vital.

*   **Consequences of Lacking Understanding:**
    *   **Without Data Quality Control:** Untrustworthy IT information (inconsistent results), slow decision-making due to time/cost of fixing inaccurate data.
    *   **Without Data Standardization:** Data duplication, data inconsistency across organizations/systems, delayed information provision (due to difficulty understanding data meaning), difficult data integration, challenging system changes and maintenance.

*   **Conclusion:** Understanding database quality control and standardization concepts and processes is extremely important for effective information system operation.

ESSENCE
B) Creation  of the view
@ A view is created  from an existing  table using the CREATE  VIEW statement  ([Figure  37]).
CREATE  VIEW  View_name
[(column_name  [,column_name...])]
[WITH  ENCRYPTION]
AS select_statement  [WITH  CHECK  OPTION]
[Figure 37] View creation  syntax
@ WITH CHECK  OPTION
* This option is used to make all data modification  statements  executed  on the view comply  with the conditions  of
the SELECT  statement.
@ WITH ENCRYPTION
+ This option prevents  users from viewing  the text that creates  a view.
+ To decrypt,  the view must be deleted,  and a new view should be created.
@ Constraints
+ The user of the view should have the SELECT  privilege  for the entity used in the view definition.
+ The SELECT  INTO statement  cannot  be used.
+ Aview  ona temporary  table cannot  be created.
+ A trigger  or an index cannot  be created  for the view.
+ Up to 250 columns  can be referred  to.
C) Modifying  data with a view
@A view  does not have a separate  data copy.
@ An update  of the view always  affects  the original table.
@ Constraints
+ An update  of the view cannot  affect more than one original  table, and it can affect only one table.
+ Acolumn  that has a calculated  value, built-in  function,  or calculation  function  cannot  be updated  using a view.
+ Anerror  will occur if a view affects  a table that has a NOT NULL column.
+ A default  value should have been defined  or Null should be allowed  for the column  without  an input value.
D) Other  considerations
@ If a new column  is added to the original table after defining  the view, this column  will not appear  in the view.
@ To change  the definition  of a view itself, the existing  view should be deleted,  and the view should be defined  again.
© The view is not automatically  deleted  even if the original entity is deleted.  Therefore,  the view should be manually
deleted.

A) Characteristics  of the distributed  database
@A distributed  database  refers to a database  that is logically  integrated  and shared so that users can recognize  it as a
single database  even though  it is physically  distributed  among  multiple  computers  on a network.
@ The distributed  database  management  system refers to a system that exchanges  and manages  the information  of
each local database  so that multiple  databases  can be recognized  as one logical database.  ([Figure  38])

© Strengths  of the distributed  database
+ Reduces  dependence  on remote  data by controlling  its data locally.
+ Large volumes  of data can be processed,  which is impossible  in a single server.
+ Scale-up  is supported  by adding  a server  to the existing  system.
+ Reliability  and availability  are improved  because  even if one site fails, only the data in that site cannot  be used.
@ Shortcomings  of the distributed  database
+ Distributed  processing  increases  complexity,  which in turn increases  software  development  costs.
+ Weak control  functions.
+ Increased  possibility  of error due to distributed  processing.
+ The response  speed may vary depending  on the condition  of the system in which data is physically  stored,
* It is difficult  to completely  ensure  data integrity.
B) Data transparency
@ To recognize  multiple  physical  databases  as a single logical database,  users do not need to know where the data are
physically  located  or how to access  it.
@ This characteristic  is called “data transparency’,  and the distributed  database  management  system provides
partitioning,  location,  replication,  failure, and concurrency  transparency.

ESSENCE
@ Partitioning  transparency
+ Partitioning  transparency  informs  users how the global schema  has been split.
+ Users do not have to know how the global schema  has been split because  the global query entered  by the user is
converted  into several  fragment  queries.
+ Vertical  partitioning  splits a relation  into relations  made up of a subset  of attributes.
+ Horizontal  partitioning  splits a relation  into relations  made up of a subset  of tuples.
@ Location  transparency
+ Location  transparency  means that users or applications  do not need to know the physical location of data in a
distributed  database.
+ That is, users should be able to access data using the same command  regardless  of the location of data or the
input system.
@© Replication  transparency
+ Replication  transparency  means that users should not need to know which data are redundant  or where the
redundant  data are stored.
+ That is, users should be able to think that they are using logically  unique data.
© Failure  transparency
+ Failure transparency  means that data integrity  should be guaranteed  even if a failure occurs in each distributed
computer ...
