## Database Management Learning Guide: Recovery & Backup

### 1. Database Recovery Techniques

Database recovery ensures data consistency and availability after failures.

#### A) Types of Database Recovery Techniques

| Technique          | Concept                                   | Characteristics                                                                | Recovery Process                                     | Speed  |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| **Log-based**      | Uses transaction log files.               | Checks all logs for Redo/Undo operations. Can be time-delayed.                 | May Redo transactions that don't need it. Uses Redo/Undo. | Slow   |
| **Checkpoint**     | Uses log files *and* checkpoints.         | Faster than log-based. Creates consistent "checkpoint" states.                 | Uses Undo operations.                                | Faster |
| **Shadow Paging**  | Uses shadow page tables (copies of pages). | Simple Undo, no Redo needed. Fast execution. Difficulty alone with multiple transactions. Overhead from copying tables. | Replaces current pages with shadow copies.           | Fastest|

### 2. Distributed Database Recovery: 2-Phase Commit Protocol

In a distributed database, a single transaction can span multiple databases (sites). Maintaining **atomicity** (all or nothing) is crucial.

#### A) Distributed Transactions

*   Accesses multiple databases, each potentially with different recovery methods.
*   **Atomicity:** All participating databases must either complete the transaction together, or none of them should complete it.
*   Prevents inconsistent states if one site commits and another aborts.
*   **2-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)** is widely used for this.

#### B) 2-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)

A protocol to ensure atomicity in distributed transactions.

*   **Coordinator (C):** Manages the transaction across participating databases (e.g., A, B).
*   **How it Works:**
    *   **Phase 1: Prepare**
        1.  Coordinator (C) asks all participating databases (A, B) if they can *prepare* to commit the transaction.
        2.  Each database replies with "ready" (can commit) or "not ready" (cannot commit/abort).
    *   **Phase 2: Commit / Abort**
        1.  **If all databases replied "ready":** Coordinator sends a "commit" signal to all.
        2.  **If any database replied "not ready" (abort):** Coordinator sends an "abort" signal to all.
*   **Outcome:** Either all complete the transaction or all cancel it, even if a failure occurs during the process.

### 3. Database Backup

#### A) Definition & Purpose

*   **Definition:** The process of creating duplicate copies (all or part) of a database to recover from failures.
*   **Common Frequency:** Daily, weekly, monthly using incremental, differential, or full backups.
*   **Purposes:**
    *   **Prevent Data Loss:** Enables recovery to a previous state.
    *   **Secure Business Continuity:** Minimizes business disruption due to IT failures.

#### B) Database Backup Requirements & Management

*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Business:**
        *   **MTTR (Mean-Time-To-Recovery):** How quickly systems must be restored.
        *   **MTBF (Mean-Time-Between-Failures):** How long systems can operate without failure.
    *   **Operational:** 24x365 service operation, backup for test/verification environments.
    *   **Technical:** Backup of OS images, database objects (logical), database configuration.
    *   **Disaster Recovery:** Consider frequency based on transaction volume, potential impact of disasters (earthquake, flood, fire).

*   **Backup Management Contents:**
    *   **Backup Policy:** Defines backup cycle (daily, weekly, monthly), scope, strategies, technologies, equipment, and recovery time minimization.
        *   *Example:* Daily archive logs, Weekly OS/user data, Monthly full DB/AP/CM backup.
    *   **Backup Configuration:** Technical architecture (e.g., disk, tape, VTL, SAN, mirror configurations).
    *   **Performing Backup & Managing History:** Execute backups, record results in logs, regularly analyze logs.
    *   **Estimating Backup Capacity:** Backup data volume can be 2-6 times the original due to duplication. Plan storage (disks/tapes) accordingly.

### 4. Types of Database Backup Methods

#### A) By Service Interruption Status

*   **Offline Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Database is stopped during backup.
    *   **Advantages:** Simple to perform.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Database is unavailable (service interruption).
*   **Online Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Database remains operational during backup.
    *   **Advantages:** No service disruption.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Increased CPU/memory usage during backup.

#### B) By Backup Range

*   **Full Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Copies the entire database.
    *   **Advantages:** Easiest recovery (only one file needed).
    *   **Disadvantages:** Takes a long time, high cost, large data volume.
*   **Differential Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Copies all changes made since the *last full backup*.
    *   **Advantages:** Less data than full backup. Faster recovery than incremental (only latest full + latest differential needed).
    *   **Disadvantages:** Requires a full backup. Backs up more data than incremental as changes accumulate.
*   **Incremental Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Copies only data changed or created since the *previous backup activity* (could be a full or another incremental backup).
    *   **Advantages:** Least data backed up, least duplicate data.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Requires a full backup. Recovery time increases significantly (latest full + *all* subsequent incremental backups needed). Recovery fails if any incremental file is missing.
*   **Archive Log Backup:**
    *   **Description:** Backs up log files that record transaction execution details.
    *   **Advantages:** Allows recovery to a specific point in time (point-in-time recovery). Minimizes data loss by restoring right before a failure.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Does not back up the actual database data; requires a separate data copy if the database itself is damaged.

### 5. Introduction to Analytics Systems (Upcoming Topics)

Recent trends show a shift towards faster and more accurate decision-making using analytical systems.

#### A) Overview of Trends

*   **From Seller-centered to Buyer-centered:** Drives need for quick, accurate analysis of customer data.
*   **Analytical Systems:** Support data collection, storage, processing, presentation, and utilization.
*   **Evolution of Data Warehouses:** From area-specific to Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDW) and semi-real-time systems.
*   **Big Data Integration:** Coexistence of Hadoop systems with existing analytical data warehouses.

#### B) Key Concepts Introduced

*   **Data Warehouse (DW):** Stores large amounts of corporate information accumulated over time.
*   **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Diversely analyzes and utilizes data from a user's perspective.
*   **Data Mining:** Finds new business insights from data.

#### C) Future Learning Objectives

1.  Explain Data Warehouse (DW) concepts and characteristics.
2.  Explain data warehouse modeling (e.g., star schema, snowflake).
3.  Explain ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) / ETT.
4.  Explain OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) concepts and search techniques.
5.  Explain Data Mining concepts and algorithms (e.g., association analysis, sequential analysis, classification, clustering).

+ This transaction  accesses  more than two databases,  and each DBMS can use different  recovery  techniques  and
transaction  managers.
+ The atomicity  of transactions  is an important  issue when building  multiple  database  systems.
+ If a certain transaction  is executed  across two sites and the transaction  is not professionally  designed,  an
inconsistent  state can be caused when one site completes  the transaction  while the other site cancels the
transaction.
+ The 2-phase  commit  protocol  should be used to maintain  the atomicity  of multiple  database  transactions.

+ Step 1: When  a transaction  is started  by transaction  coordinator  C, coordinator  C sends a message  asking  whether
the transaction  can be completed  to databases  A and B, and database  A and B reply  with the “ready” status.
+ Step 2: If all participating  databases  are “ready’, the coordinator  sends a “completion  (commit)’  signal. If one or more
participating  databases  signals a “not ready (abort)’  signal, the coordinator  sends  a “cancellation  (abort)’  signal.
