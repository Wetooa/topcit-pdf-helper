## 2. Software Reuse: Core Concepts

### 2.1 What is Software Reuse?
*   **Definition:** Developing new software using existing software or validated software knowledge. It involves standardizing development knowledge (functions, modules, configuration) for repeated use.
*   **Reusable Assets:** This includes not just code, but also:
    *   Design
    *   Requirements
    *   Inspection plans
    *   Architecture

### 2.2 Why is Software Reuse Important? (Background & Purpose)
*   **Background:**
    *   Addresses issues like **deteriorating quality and productivity** (the "software crisis").
    *   Supported by advances in **automation technology** (e.g., CASE tools).
    *   Drives efforts for **software development standardization** and quality assurance.
*   **Purpose / Benefits:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Uses components with proven performance (functions, stability, speed).
    *   **Scalability:** Easier to upgrade based on proven functions.
    *   **Productivity:** Improves the overall development process, reducing:
        *   Cost
        *   Time
        *   Risk

### 2.3 What Can Be Reused? (Targets of Software Reuse)
*   **General Knowledge:** Environmental information, external project knowledge.
*   **Design Information:** System architecture, system design.
*   **Data Information:** System data, test cases.
*   **Program Code:** Modules, programs.
*   **Other Deliverables:** Cost-benefit analyses, user documentation, feasibility studies, prototypes.
*   **People:** Leveraging human expertise and experience.

### 2.4 Principles of Effective Software Reuse
For software to be truly reusable, it should adhere to these principles:
*   **Generality:** Designed to be broadly applicable, not just for a specific use case.
*   **Modularity:** Follows principles of information hiding and abstraction, with:
    *   **Minimum coupling:** Components are independent.
    *   **Maximum cohesion:** Components perform a single, well-defined task.
*   **Hardware Independence:** Works regardless of the execution hardware.
*   **Software Independence:** Not tied to a specific Operating System (OS) or Database Management System (DBMS).
*   **Self-documentation:** Clear descriptions of its function, usage, and interfaces.
*   **Commonality:** Fills a common need and is usable by many developers.
*   **Reliability:** Proven to be dependable during use.

## 3. Challenges & Solutions for Software Reuse

### 3.1 Common Problems in Practical Business Reuse
*   **Finding Components:** Difficult to locate suitable, common software modules.
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Software often isn't standardized enough for easy reuse.
*   **Understanding Interfaces:** Difficulty understanding internal interface requirements of modules.
*   **Side Effects:** Hard to predict unintended consequences of changes to reused components.
*   **Cost of Creation:** Developing high-quality, reusable components can be more expensive upfront.
*   **Delayed Benefits:** Benefits of reuse might only become apparent in the long term.
*   **Extraction Difficulty:** Challenging to extract reusable components from existing, non-reusable software.

### 3.2 Obstacles to Software Reuse
*   **People-Related:**
    *   Adverse reactions from managers and developers.
    *   Lack of motivation to adopt reuse technology.
*   **Technical/Organizational:**
    *   Lack of software standardization.
*   **External:**
    *   Social or legal obstacles.

### 3.3 Strategies for Establishing a Reuse Culture (Countermeasures)
To overcome obstacles and foster reuse, organizations need to change perceptions and implement policies:
*   **Form a Reuse Management Organization:**
    *   Establishes reuse-based development methods.
    *   Introduces and enforces reuse procedures and standards.
    *   Enacts policies to increase reusability.
*   **Provide Regular Reuse Training:**
    *   Educate developers, project managers, and organization managers.
    *   Content should be tailored to each role.
*   **Implement a Reward System:**
    *   Introduce incentives (e.g., bonuses, recognition) to encourage and reward reuse.
*   **Ensure Reliability of Reused Components:**
    *   Guarantee the quality and reliability of components in the reuse library.
    *   Provide tools and support to help developers find and trust suitable components.

implementing  user stories using the planning  poker.
+ Empirical  model: Scrum has its own process  model, but many techniques  place emphasis  on the experience  of
the individuals  participating  in the project. As each project  has its own intrinsic  situation  and characteristics,
it is difficult  to understand  the project  situation  using the existing  standardized  process.  Scrum accepts  that
something  can actually  be different  for each team even though  the basic structure  is the same.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
We can see that enterprises  are increasingly  reusing their software  as their business  becomes
globalized.  Software  is reused to develop  and maintain  new features  using knowledge  proven in the
past. Many enterprises  are considering  how to increase  the reuse rate because  it is a highly  effective
means of reducing  costs through productivity  and quality improvements  thanks to reproduction  of
software  in a short period of time.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To understand  the concept,  purpose,  and target of software  reuse, the actual method  of
application,  and its effects,  considerations,  etc.
2. To understand  the concept  of reverse engineering,  the reason for its necessity,  strengths,  and
considerations.
>> Keywords
- Reuse,  reverse  engineering
- Code reuse, software  standardization

+ Preview  for practical  business Establishing  a system for creating  a
reuse culture
Development  teams need to change their perception  and culture in order to incorporate  software
reuse into the development  process.  To reuse software,  developers  are required  to change  their way
of thinking,  and a new culture should be created  from the organization  and policy perspectives.  The
following  should be performed  to fully establish  the system.
- Composition  of the reuse management  organization:  The reuse management  organization  is
needed to establish  the reuse-based  method of software  development.  This organization  should
introduce  and establish  procedures  and standards  related  to reuse and enact and implement  a policy
for increasing  reusability.
- Training  on reuse: Training  on software  reuse should be conducted  on a regular basis to create an
atmosphere  or culture conducive  to software  reuse within the organization.  The training  should be
also provided  to project  managers  and organization  managers,  in addition  to developers.  In terms of
content,  the training  for managers  should differ from that intended  for developers.
- Introduction  of a reward system to increase  reusability:  Reuse may be perceived  with extreme
discomfort  when first introduced. Therefore,  a method should be devised  to increase reusability  by
policy. Introducing  an incentive  system  for reuse is the representative  method  in this regard.
- Securing  reliability  for reused components:  To make developers  trust reused components,  the
reliability  of the components  managed  in the reuse library should be sufficiently  guaranteed  and
measures  to help them find suitable  components  should be prepared,  in addition  to the change of
developer's  awareness.
