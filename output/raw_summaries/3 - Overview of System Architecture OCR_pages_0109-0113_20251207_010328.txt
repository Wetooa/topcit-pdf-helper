    *   **High-End Server:**
        *   **Cost:** Hundreds of millions to billions of won (very expensive).
        *   **Use:** Database server, enterprise server.
        *   **CPU:** Tens of CPUs per socket.

*   **Classification by Configuration:**
    *   **Rack-mount Server:**
        *   **Description:** Fits into standardized racks (steel frames) for server/network equipment.
        *   **Use:** Data centers, server rooms (where multiple devices are present).
        *   **Standard Sizes:** 1U, 2U, 4U (installed in 19-inch racks).
        *   **Connections:** Power, network, SAN switch connected separately.
    *   **Tower Server:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to a general PC, stands upright.
        *   **Use:** In-house server rooms, offices, stores.
        *   **Note:** Low-noise versions exist for office environments.
    *   **Blade Server:**
        *   **Description:** Maximizes capacity in minimal size by plugging multiple CPU "blades" into a single chassis/frame.
        *   **Advantage:** High density (more servers in the same space than rack-mount), reduced and integrated server/network components within the box.
        *   **Feature:** Often comes with pre-installed operating systems.

#### 5.2 Storage

*   **Definition:** Provides large storage space, high performance, and high availability compared to general disk arrays.
*   **Classification:** Based on processing capacity, typically into enterprise or mid-range storage.

Overview  of System  Architecture
>p> Recent  trends  and issues
With the advent  of the information  age, the social demand  to construct  information  system infrastructure
is increasing,  and various information  systems  are being implemented  for business  efficiency  and customer
service improvement.  These information  systems  generally  consist  of hardware,  software,  and human
resources.  It is necessary  to understand  the concept,  architecture,  and structure  of the information  to
implement  a successful  information  system.
Recent information  systems  tend to adopt a large number  of web-based  structures.  In that regard,
theinformation  system projects  of the planners  (public institutions)  and implementers  (systems  integrators
and hardware  manufacturers)  need to procure hardware  resources  that suit the project scope in order to
improve  the efficiency  of investment  in information  systems.
Information  system infrastructure  is generally  implemented  by purchasing  servers, storage,  and network
devices  separately  from each vendor, then integrating  them for the project. Moreover,  they also purchase
software  separately,  and thus need to test and verify if it works properly  with the hardware.
The complex  structures  and procedures  of constructing  information  system infrastructure  have inevitably
resulted in inefficiency  in construction  time and system management.  The converged  infrastructure
that integrates  the hardware,such  as storage,  servers, and networks,  with the virtualization  solution  and
the management  software  into a product,  and validates  it in advance  for supply to customers, has been
introduced  to compensate  for it. Moreover,  the hyper-converged  infrastructure  that complements  the high
investment  cost has also appeared.  These efforts to increase  the efficiency  of system  implementation  are
ongoing,
1, To be able to explain information  system  structures,
2. To be able to calculate  information  system capacity.
3, To be able to explain the latest OS technologies  and trends,

+ Preview  for practical  business
Company  A has recently  launched  a new system,  but recognized  that its hardware  capacity  is about 30%
insufficient  during a service.  An investigation  found that the concurrent  user calculation  of some services
was inaccurate,  leading to incorrect  hardware  capacity  selection.  The current infrastructure  is expected
to face inadequacy  within three to four months if the company  operates  the system as is. Therefore,
Company  A’s Planning  Team decided to allocate the additional  budget to expand the infrastructure  in
two months.  This case shows the practical  importance  of calculating  the information  system capacity,
according  to its structural  design and system structure.  This chapter  describes  information  structure  and
size calculation  in detail.
01 Information  System  Structure
A) Concept  of information  system
An information  system uses information  technology  (IT) to perform  business  procedures,  such as providing  necessary
information, or business  processing  required  by enterprises.  It creates a system that enables  IT personnel  to provide
IT services  by using IT components,  such as hardware  and software,  to perform  organizational  business  procedures.
As shown in [Figure 75], the information  system provides  services  by using the technology  resources  of the IT
infrastructure.  The IT infrastructure  includes  computing  platforms,  such as networks,  hardware,  software,  IT personnel,
and IT services.
