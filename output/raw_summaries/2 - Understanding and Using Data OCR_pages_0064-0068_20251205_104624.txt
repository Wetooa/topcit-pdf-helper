# Database Concepts: Simplified Learning Guide (Pages 64-68)

## 1. Connection Traps

A **Connection Trap** occurs when you cannot accurately retrieve desired information, even though relationships exist in your data model.

### A) Fan Trap
*   **Description:** Happens with three entity types (A, B, C) and specific relationships:
    *   A has an N:1 relationship with B (Many A's linked to one B).
    *   B has a 1:N relationship with C (One B linked to many C's).
*   **Problem:** You can't determine the specific link between A and C through B.
    *   *Example:* If an Employee (A) belongs to a Branch (B) (N:1), and a Branch (B) has many Departments (C) (1:N), you might not know which Department a specific Employee belongs to directly from these links.
*   **Solution:** Modify or restructure the relationships to clarify the path, often by adding a direct link or adjusting cardinality.

### B) Chasm Trap
*   **Description:** Occurs when the flow of information is broken due to an **optional relationship** rather than a mandatory one.
*   **Problem:** You cannot find information for entities that *do not participate* in the optional part of the relationship.
    *   *Example:* If "Employee owns Vehicle" is optional, and "Vehicle is managed by Branch" is a link, you can find the branch for employees who own vehicles. However, you cannot find the branch for employees who *don't* own vehicles if that's the only path.
*   **Solution:** Explicitly add missing relationships that are logically required to connect all necessary information paths.

## 2. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique that links a relational database table to a class in object-oriented design.

### A) Class Conversion Rules
*   An **Object-Oriented Class** maps to a **Database Table**.
*   A **Class Instance Object** maps to a **Table Record (row)**.
*   A **Class Attribute** maps to a **Table Column (field)**.
*   **Class Operations (methods)** are implemented in the application program and do not have a direct database table element equivalent.

### B) Converting Class Relations to Relational Relationships

#### Association
*   **1:M Relationship (One-to-Many):** The **Primary Key (PK)** of the "one" side becomes a **Foreign Key (FK)** on the "many" side table.
*   **1:1 Relationship (One-to-One):**
    *   Option 1: The PK of the less frequently accessed class is used as an FK in the more frequently accessed class.
    *   Option 2: The two classes (and their corresponding tables) are combined into a single class/table.
*   **M:N Relationship (Many-to-Many):** A new class (and corresponding table, often called a "junction" or "join" table) is created specifically to represent this relationship.

#### Aggregation
*   Implemented by referencing the related table using a **Foreign Key**.

#### Composition
*   Implemented using a **constraint** (e.g., `ON DELETE CASCADE` in SQL) to ensure that when a "parent" object/record is deleted, its "child" objects/records are also deleted.

#### Generalization (Inheritance)
*   **Option 1:** The superclass and each subclass are mapped to separate tables.
*   **Option 2:** The superclass table includes all attributes from all its subclasses.
*   **Option 3:** Each subclass table includes the attributes of its superclass.

## 3. Data Integrity and Keys

**Data Integrity** refers to the measures taken to protect data and ensure its accuracy, validity, consistency, and stability.

### A) Types of Integrity

There are typically three to five types of integrity:
*   **Three types:** Entity, Referential, Domain.
*   **Five types:** Entity, Key, Referential, Domain, User-defined.

1.  **Domain Integrity:**
    *   Ensures the integrity of individual fields (columns) within a table.
    *   Involves defining data types, allowing/disallowing `NULL` values, and ensuring attribute values are atomic (indivisible) and fall within a specified range or set of values.
2.  **Key Integrity:**
    *   Ensures that every record in a table can be uniquely identified.
3.  **Entity Integrity:**
    *   Dictates that every table must have a **Primary Key (PK)**.
    *   The PK value must be **unique** for each record and **cannot be NULL**.
4.  **Referential Integrity:**
    *   Maintains consistency between data in related tables.
    *   A **Foreign Key (FK)** value must either be `NULL` or match an existing Primary Key value in the table it references.
    *   If a Primary Key is referenced by an FK, it typically cannot be deleted or modified in a way that would break the link (e.g., `RESTRICT` delete, `CASCADE` delete).
5.  **User-defined Integrity:**
    *   Specific business rules or custom constraints that are not covered by the other standard integrity types.

### B) Types of Keys

1.  **Super Key:**
    *   An attribute or a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record within a table.
2.  **Candidate Key:**
    *   A **Super Key** that is both **unique** and **minimal**.
    *   Minimal means no attribute can be removed from it without losing its unique identification capability.
    *   These are potential choices for the Primary Key.
3.  **Primary Key (PK):**
    *   A unique identifier chosen from the **Candidate Keys** to specifically distinguish records in a table.
    *   Must be **unique**, **minimal**, and **NOT NULL**.
    *   **Selection Considerations:**
        *   Choose fields whose values are **stable** and do not change frequently.
        *   Choose fields with **simple and short data domains** to minimize comparison costs.
4.  **Foreign Key (FK):**
    *   An attribute or set of attributes in one table (the referencing table) that links to a unique key (usually the Primary Key) in another table (the referenced table).
    *   **Properties:**
        *   Its value, if not `NULL`, **must exist** as a Primary Key value in the referenced table.
        *   An FK **can have duplicate values** (e.g., many employees can belong to the same department).
        *   An FK **can be NULL** if the relationship it represents is optional.

## 4. Normalization and Denormalization

*   **Normalization:** A fundamental database theory that removes data redundancy and anomalies (like update, insertion, and deletion problems). It ensures stable and consistent data management.
    *   Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, Boyce-Codd, 4NF, 5NF) are based on functional and semantic dependencies between attributes.
*   **Denormalization:** A design technique used to intentionally introduce redundancy into a normalized database. Its main purpose is to **improve query performance** by reducing the need for complex joins.

0? Connection  Trap
The connection  trap means that desired information  cannot  be accurately  found even though  a relationship  has been
established  in a data model. Representative  types include  the fan trap and the chasm trap.
A) Fan trap
@ The fan trap can occur when there are entity  types A, B, and C, and when there is an N:1 relationship  between  entities
Aand B, and a 1:N relationship  between  entities  B and C.
@ An example  of the fan trap is as follows.
+ [Figure 25(a)] shows a case in which each branch is composed  of several departments,  with several employees
belonging  to each branch.
+ The fan trap is found in this case because  the department  to which each employee  belongs  cannot  be known.
+ The fan trap can be removed  by modifying  it, as shown in [Figure  25(b)].

B) Chasm  trap
@ The chasm trap means that desired information  cannot be found due to the disconnection of the information  flow
when there is an optional  relationship  rather  than a mandatory  relationship.
@ ([Figure  26]) shows an example  of the chasm trap.
+ [Figure 26(a)] shows a case in which several branches  are registered  in one branch, with each vehicle being owned
by one employee.
+ In this case, we can know to which branch the employee  who owns a vehicle belongs,  but we cannot  know to which
branch the employee  who does not own a vehicle  belongs.
* To eliminate  the chasm trap, a relationship  that is missing,  even though it is required  in terms of meaning,  should be
explicitly  linked again ([Figure  26(b)]).

08 Object-Relational  Mapping  (ORM)
Object-relational  mapping  means that the table of the relational  database  corresponds  to the class used in the
object-oriented  design.

+ 1:1 relationship  - the primary  key of the side that is less frequently  accessed  is mapped  on to the foreign key of the
side that is most frequently  accessed,  or the two classes  are combined  into one class.
+ M: N relationship  - a new class corresponding  to the relationship  is created.
@ Aggregation
The table concerned  is referenced  using the foreign key.
@ Composition

@ Generalization
+ The super class and each sub-class  are mapped  on to separate  tables.
+ (Or) A super-class  has all attributes  of the sub-class.
+ (Or) A sub-class  has the attribute  of the super-class.
09 Integrity  and Key
Data integrity refers to the need to protect data from lost updates  of data to maintain  their accuracy,  validity,
consistency,  and stability.  Three to five types of integrity  are defined depending  on the viewpoint.  Three types of
integrity  include entity, referential,  and domain integrity.  Five types of integrity  are also defined by separating  entity
integrity  into entity integrity  and key integrity,  and by including  user-defined  integrity.  To main integrity  in this way,
the primary  and foreign keys should be carefully  selected  and used.
A) Integrity
@ Domain integrity:  Domain integrity  means to ensure the integrity  of the field in a table. Data types, allowing  a null
value, etc. can be defined  and used. The attribute  value has atomicity  and should be a value defined  in the domain.
@ Key integrity:  All records  in a table should be identifiable  from each other.
© Entity integrity:  All tables must have a primary  key, and each primary  key must have a unique  value (but not null).
@ Referential  integrity:  Data in two tables in a reference  relationship  must always have consistent  values. A foreign key
must be a null value or a value that exists in the primary  key of the table referenced  by the foreign key. If there is a
