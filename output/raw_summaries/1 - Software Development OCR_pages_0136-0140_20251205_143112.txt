    *   **Trend:** Evolving to cloud-based platforms (e.g., Codenvy, GoormIDE, Cloud9).
    *   **Benefit:** Enables development regardless of location and doesn't require local installation.

2.  **Integrating Software Development Tools with ALM (Application Lifecycle Management)**
    *   **Traditional:** Separate tools for specific steps/purposes (performance, requirements, issue management).
    *   **Trend:** Tools are integrating into comprehensive ALM solutions due to complex infrastructure and demand for faster IT services.
    *   **ALM Scope:** Encompasses development, testing, and operation.
    *   **Example:** Performance management tools now integrate with ALM to detect code changes and support build/distribution processes.

### B) Programming Languages

1.  **TypeScript (Extended JavaScript)**
    *   **Context:** JavaScript is a widely used, powerful language for front-end web development.
    *   **What it is:** An open-source project by Microsoft (2012), extending JavaScript. It's the base language for Angular.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Includes all JavaScript functionalities.
        *   **Static Type Language:** Checks types during compilation, improving reliability.
        *   Easy compilation across all browsers and environments.
        *   Class/component-based for easier coding and learning.
        *   Applicable to large-scale applications.

2.  **Java 9 Release**
    *   **Context:** An object-oriented programming language, highly popular in web development.
    *   **Key Features (approx. 90 new features):**
        *   **Increased Modularization:** Optimizes for small devices, improves scalability and performance.
        *   **Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation:** Compiles code before execution, reducing application startup time.
        *   **REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) Support:** Allows receiving immediate feedback on code before full compilation.

3.  **Kotlin**
    *   **What it is:** A functional programming language developed by JetBrains (creator of Android Studio).

## 4. Technology Trends: Development Frameworks & Software Architecture

### A) Development Frameworks

1.  **Angular 4**
    *   **What it is:** A JavaScript framework developed by Google.
    *   **Use Case:** Primarily for **Single-Page Application (SPA)** programs.
    *   **SPA Definition:** A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts with the app, without requiring full page reloads.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Built using TypeScript 2.1.
        *   Supports program logic and backend binding, enabling dynamic rather than static web pages.

2.  **React**
    *   **What it is:** A JavaScript library created by Facebook (used for Facebook's web interface).
    *   **Use Case:** A web front-end framework especially useful for building large-scale applications with frequent page changes.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **JSX (JavaScript XML):** Allows writing markup code within JavaScript using an extended syntax.
        *   Supports **components:** Individual, reusable units for building user interfaces.
        *   Uses the **Virtual DOM** for efficient data processing and UI updates.

3.  **Express.js**
    *   **What it is:** A small, flexible web application framework for Node.js.
    *   **Node.js Context:** A back-end server development language based on events, using Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.
    *   **Use Case:** Provides optimal features for fast web or application development with Node.js.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Enables processing of dynamic HTML pages based on parameters passed to templates.
        *   Supports a middleware structure (JavaScript code) to combine only necessary functions.

### B) Software Architecture

1.  **Microservice Architecture**
    *   **Concept:** Divides a large application into several small, independent services. Each service has its own data repository and execution environment.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **High Development Productivity:** Services are developed independently in small units.
        *   **Flexible Deployment:** Services can be deployed unit-by-unit, not just the whole application.
        *   **Elaborate Scalability:** System units can be expanded independently as needed.
        *   Prompt response to business changes, faster deployment, easier improvements and modifications.

2.  **Docker**
    *   **What it is:** An open-source platform that automates **Linux Container (LXC)** technology.
    *   **LXC Purpose:** Provides an independent and isolated space, similar to a virtual machine, but more lightweight and efficient.
    *   **Benefit:** Simplifies the packaging and deployment of applications and their dependencies in isolated environments.
    *   **Significance:** Widely adopted; companies like Docker (formerly DotCloud) and Google (with Kubernetes) provide significant support.

ESSENCE
* Preview  for practical  business Do you need to make software
development  more efficient?
It has been reported  that the work productivity  of Korea is very low compared  to that of other
advanced  countries  in the global labor market.  The Korean IT industry  is no exception  to the rule. The
IT industry has been making efforts to increase  efficiency  in its own way. Development  productivity
should have been improved  to develop  a system that became  vaster and more complex  in line with
technological  advances.  As a result of these efforts, numerous  platforms  and frameworks,  such as
RAD, agile, CBD, and OOP, and various  CASE tools have been released.
Tools that can be used appropriately  by keeping  pace with the current  era of rapid change  have been
continuously  developed.  The “issue of efficiency”  is the main driver behind countless  tools. Efficiency
became  important  in terms of securing  higher productivity,  improving  quality, and completing  a given
project within  a set period. As the tools described  above were released,  higher productivity  and
quality in software  development  could be secured  to some degree.

01 Technology  Trends  of Software  Development  Tools and Programming
Languages
A) Technology  trends  of software  development  tools
@ Highlighting  the cloud-based  integrated  development  environment
Integrated  development  environment  software  supports  all tasks related to programs  and development,  such
as coding, debugging,  compilation,  and deployment,  in one unified program  development  environment.  It has
been highlighted  as a development  tool capable  of meeting  the calls of open source and global IT companies
for rapid development.  This environment  is evolving  into a cloud-based  one, such as Codenvy,  GoormIDE,
and Cloud9,  which enables  development  regardless  of the location  and does not require the installation  of an
integrated  development  program.
@ Integrating  software  development  tools and ALM (Application  Lifecycle  Management)
Performance  management  tools, requirements  management  tools, issue management  tools, etc. that support
development  were designed  to manage  specific purposes  and specific steps. Since the introduction  of the
cloud, it has been evolving  into a tool that encompasses  development/test/operation  due to the complexity
of the infrastructure  and the market environment,  which demands  ever faster IT services.  The main purpose
of the performance  management  tool was to prevent  application  delays and improve  performance.  Recently,
such tools have been integrated  with ALM, which detects  changed  codes and manages  the changes,  and
supports  build/distribution  comprehensively.
B) Technology  trends  of programming  languages
® TypeScript,  an extended  version  of JavaScript
JavaScript  is one of the most popular  and powerful  programming  languages  in the world. It is often used to
make an interactive  web page by adding some effects to a web page, creating  a game, animation,  or drop-
down menu, and effectively  controlling  the web interface.  This programming  language  is basically  useful for
front-end  development  and is used by 88% of all websites.
Recently,  TypeScript  has been highlighted  as an extended  version  of JavaScript.  TypeScript  is an open source
project  created  by Microsoft  in 2012, and is used as the base language  of Angular.
+ Key features  of TypeScript
- It includes  the functions  of JavaScript  as it is based on JavaScript.
- Itis a “static type” language  that checks types at the time of compilation.
- It offers ease of compilation  in all browsers  and environments,  making  it highly useful.
- It enables  easy coding  and learning  because  everything  is a class...
