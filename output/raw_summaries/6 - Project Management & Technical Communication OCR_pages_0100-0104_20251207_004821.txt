# Project Management & Cost Control Learning Guide

## I. Project Scheduling Techniques

### A. Backward Scheduling (Calculating Late Dates)
*   **Purpose:** Determine the latest possible start (LS) and finish (LF) dates for activities without delaying the project.
*   **Late Finish (LF) Calculation:**
    *   For the last activity in a path, its LF is the project's target finish date.
    *   For an activity with successors: Its LF is the *earliest* Late Start (LS) of all its direct successor activities, minus one unit of time.
    *   *Example (Activity D):* If Activity C can start latest on day 12 (LS=12) and Activity E can start latest on day 8 (LS=8), then Activity D must finish by day 7 (LF = min(12, 8) - 1 = 7).
*   **Late Start (LS) Calculation:** LS = LF - Duration + 1

### B. Critical Path Method (CPM)
*   **Total Float (TF):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date.
    *   **Formula:** TF = LF - EF (Late Finish - Early Finish) OR TF = LS - ES (Late Start - Early Start)
*   **Critical Path:**
    *   A sequence of activities where the Total Float for *all* activities along that path is **zero**.
    *   Any delay in an activity on the critical path will directly delay the entire project.
    *   **Importance:** Critical path activities are the primary focus for schedule management to ensure the project finishes on time.

### C. Critical Chain Method (CCM)
*   **Purpose:** A scheduling method that extends CPM by accounting for limited resources and activity duration uncertainty.
*   **Key Concept: Buffering**
    *   **Project Buffer:** A time buffer added at the very end of the critical chain to protect the overall project finish date from delays.
    *   **Feeding Buffer:** Time buffers placed where non-critical paths (feeding chains) merge into the critical chain. These protect the critical chain from delays in the feeding paths.
*   **Management Focus:** Instead of tracking Total Float, CCM focuses on managing the remaining durations of buffers against the remaining durations of activity chains.

## II. Schedule Compression Techniques

*   **Goal:** Shorten the project schedule, often due to requirement changes or fixed deadlines.

### A. Crashing
*   **Definition:** Shortening the schedule by adding extra resources to activities.
*   **Application:** Primarily effective for activities on the critical path where adding resources can reduce duration.
*   **Examples:** Approving overtime, hiring more staff, paying for faster completion.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Pros:** Can effectively shorten the schedule.
    *   **Cons:** Almost always increases project costs; can increase risk due to new resources or complex communication.

### B. Fast Tracking
*   **Definition:** Performing activities in parallel (simultaneously) that would normally be done sequentially.
*   **Application:** Only possible when activities can be overlapped.
*   **Example:** Starting construction (foundations) before all detailed architectural drawings are fully complete.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Pros:** Can shorten the schedule without necessarily increasing direct costs (though rework costs might arise).
    *   **Cons:** Significantly increases the risk of rework or errors, as decisions for later activities are made before earlier ones are fully finalized.

## III. Project Cost Management

### A. Overview
*   **Definition:** The processes of planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs to complete a project within an approved financial budget.
*   **Importance:** Projects operate with limited resources, making efficient cost management crucial.

### B. Core Processes
1.  **Cost Management Planning:** Defining how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled.
2.  **Cost Estimation:** Developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete project activities.
3.  **Budgeting:** Aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline.
4.  **Cost Control:** Monitoring project status to update project costs and managing changes to the cost baseline.

### C. Cost Estimation Techniques
*   **One-Point Estimating:** A single, most likely estimate.
*   **Three-Point Estimating:** Uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to calculate a range or weighted average.
*   **Analogous Estimating:** Uses actual costs from previous, similar projects as a basis.
*   **Parametric Estimating:** Uses statistical relationships between historical data and other variables (e.g., cost per line of code, cost per square foot).
*   **Expert Judgment:** Estimates based on the expertise of individuals or groups with relevant experience.
*   **M/M (Man/Month):** Estimates effort based on the number of people and months.
*   **Function Point:** A method to estimate software development size based on functionality.

### D. Earned Value Management (EVM) Terminology
*   **Purpose:** A project management technique to objectively measure project performance and progress by integrating scope, schedule, and cost.
*   **Measurement:**
    *   **BAC (Budget At Completion):** Total planned budget for the project.
    *   **Planned Value (PV):** The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work.
    *   **Earned Value (EV):** The value of the work actually performed (measured against the budget).
    *   **Actual Cost (AC):** The total cost incurred for the work performed.
*   **Analysis (Performance Indicators):**
    *   **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV (measures schedule performance).
    *   **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC (measures cost performance).
    *   **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV (efficiency of time utilization).
    *   **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC (efficiency of budget utilization).
*   **Estimation (Forecasting):**
    *   **EAC (Estimate At Completion):** The projected total cost of the project at completion.
    *   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):** The estimated cost needed to finish the remaining work.

## IV. Practical Application: SW Engineer Wage Data (Example)

*   **Context:** Software engineer wage surveys (e.g., from the Korea Software Industry Association) are important for project cost estimation.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identify wage trends for SW engineers.
    *   Provide basic data for policy making.
    *   Help companies determine unit wages for engineers in software projects.
*   **Key Notes for Using Wage Data:**
    *   Survey results are typically **not mandatory** for software businesses.
    *   Wages often include base pay, allowances, bonuses, and benefits.
    *   Daily, monthly, and hourly rates are usually provided, with clear calculation methodologies (e.g., monthly = daily * avg. working days).
    *   Surveys may evolve to focus on broader IT professions rather than just specific ranks.

F 14(16-3  + 1) 3 16
For Activity  “F’, there is no LS of successor  activity,  so LF starts with 16.
In the case of Activity  “D’, there are two successor  activities:  “C” and “E”. In this case, the “C’” and “E” activities
can start only after the “D’ activity  ends. The “C’ activity  must start on the 12th at the latest (LS, Late Start),
and the “E” activity  must start on the 8th at the latest.
Therefore,  Activity  “D’ must finish on the 7th at the latest (Late Finish), and the faster “E” of the two activities
can start normally  on the 8th. So, the LF of Activity  “D’ becomes  8 (LS of Activity  “E”) - 1 = 7. Subsequently,
the LS of Activity  “D’ also becomes  7 - 4 + 1 = 4. After calculating  both the LS and LF of the individual
activities,  write them as shown in the figure below.

@ Total Float, Critical Path Calculation
The formula  for calculating  Total Float for each activity  is as follows:
+ TF = LF - EF or
+ TF=LS-ES
The reason for calculating  Total Float is to determine  the critical path. In other words, the critical path is a path
that connects  activities  whose Total Float is “zero”. Therefore,  the critical path in this example  becomes  “A-D-
E-F’ indicated  in red as shown in the figure below.

[Figure 33] Critical Path Method@  (Example)
Any delay in activities  on the critical path will result in a delay in the overall project  schedule.  Hence, activities
on the critical path become  intensive  targets  of schedule  management.
B) Schedule  development  technique  - critical chain method  (CCM)
Critical Chain Technique  or Critical Chain Method  is a scheduling  method  that allows the project  team to buf-
fer the project  schedule  in consideration  of limited resources  and uncertainty.
In order to consider  the effects  of resource  allocation,  optimization  and leveling,  and activity duration  un-
certainty  on the critical path determined  by the Critical Path Method,  the concept  of buffering  and buffering
management  is added to the CPM.
The figure below shows how Buffer is added to the example  of the CPM assuming  the uncertainty  of the du-
ration of the activities.
[Figure  34] Critical  Chain Method  (Example)
The buffer  added at the end of the critical chain is called Project  Buffer, and it its to prevent  the target finish date from
slippage  along the critical chain.
An additional  buffer, called Feeding  Buffer, is placed at each point at which non-critical  activities which don’t belong to
the critical chain (red line in the figure) merges into the critical chain. The size of the feeding  buffer should be deter-
mined by taking into account  the uncertainty  over the duration  of the feeding  chain linked up to that buffer.
After determining  the buffer schedule,  the activities scheduled  for the latest possible  start and finish dates should be
scheduled.  As a result, the critical chain method  focuses  on managing  remaining  buffer durations  against  the remaining
durations  of chains of activities,  instead  of the total float of network  paths.

C) Schedule  compression  technique  - crashing  and fast tracking
The most common  cause of schedule  compression  in a typical project is requirements  change. Despite
frequent  changes  in the requirements,  the project  finish date cannot be changed  in reality, so there are many
cases where it is necessary  to shorten  the development  schedule  or test schedule  at the end of the project.
Here are some typical schedule  compression  techniques.
@ Crashing
Crashing  is a technique  that compresses  the schedule  by adding extra resources  at minimum  cost. Examples
of crashing  include approval  of overtime  work, replenishment  of resources,  and payment  for activities  in the
critical path. Crashing  is effective  only for activities  of which duration  is shortened  by replenishing  resources  in
the critical path. However,  crashing  may lead to an increase  in cost. It can also lead to an increase  in the risk
due to sharing  the contents  of an existing  project  for new human resources  or many communication  channels,
@ Fast Tracking
Fast Tracking  is a method  of shortening  a certain period  of time in which activities  or steps that are performed
sequentially  are ...
