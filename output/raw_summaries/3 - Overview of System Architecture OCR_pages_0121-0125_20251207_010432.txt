## IT Infrastructure & System Availability: Learning Guide

This guide covers modern IT infrastructure trends (CI, HCI) and strategies for ensuring system continuity (HA, DR).

---

### Part 1: Modern IT Infrastructure Trends

#### 1. Traditional IT Infrastructure: The Problem

*   **Process:** Servers, storage, network devices, and software are purchased separately from different vendors.
*   **Integration:** IT staff or resellers integrate components on-site.
*   **Issues:**
    *   Complexity and inefficiency.
    *   Long implementation times.
    *   Difficult system management.
    *   Requires extensive testing for hardware-software compatibility.
    *   Maintenance and support from multiple suppliers.

#### 2. Converged Infrastructure (CI)

*   **Concept:** An approach to solve traditional IT infrastructure problems.
*   **Integration:** Hardware (servers, storage, network) is integrated with virtualization and management software into a *single product*.
*   **Supplier Role:** Vendors pre-validate the integrated product before supplying it to customers.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Faster service implementation due to pre-integration and validation.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **High Cost:** Integrates expensive external storage.
    *   **Poor Performance** relative to input resources.
    *   **Limited Scalability**.

#### 3. Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)

*   **Concept:** Overcomes the limitations of CI by eliminating expensive external storage.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Uses **direct attached storage (DAS)** from standard x86 servers.
    *   Combines DAS from multiple servers using **Software-Defined Storage (SDS)** technology over an IP network.
    *   Creates a unified storage pool, similar to a Storage Area Network (SAN), but without dedicated external storage hardware.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Eliminates costly external storage.
    *   Reduces overall costs.
    *   Simplifies architectural complexity.

### Part 2: High Availability (HA) & Disaster Recovery (DR)

#### Learning Objectives:

1.  Explain High Availability (HA) and Fault Tolerance (FT) technology and operational principles.
2.  Explain Disaster Recovery (DR) configuration and utilization.

#### The Importance of System Continuity

*   Information systems are critical; failures can have huge impacts (e.g., bank system outages, data center fires).
*   **Goal:** Ensure information systems provide services safely and continuously.
*   **Strategy:** Implement High Availability (HA) configurations and Disaster Recovery (DR) centers.
*   **Redundancy:** Most major systems are built with redundancy. Critical systems also include spare systems (often via DR centers).

#### Key Metrics for Recovery: RPO & RTO

*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**
    *   **Definition:** The maximum acceptable time to restore normal service after a failure or disaster.
    *   **Focus:** How quickly can the system be back online.
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**
    *   **Definition:** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss that can occur during a failure or disaster.
    *   **Focus:** How much data can be lost (i.e., how recent must the recovered data be).

#### 1. High Availability (HA)

*   **Concept:** Ensuring uninterrupted service.
*   **Reality:** Achieving 100% availability is difficult. HA focuses on making services available even when components fail.
*   **Strategy:** Prepare for failures by configuring redundant systems, typically using **clustering** (two or more systems working together).
*   **HA Criterion: "5 Nines" (99.999% Availability)**
    *   Represents less than 5 minutes and 15 seconds of unplanned service downtime per year.
    *   The level of HA is often expressed by the number of "nines."
*   **Availability Calculation Formula:**
    *   **A = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)**
        *   **A (Availability):** The percentage of time a system is operational.
        *   **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** The average time a system operates without failure.
        *   **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair):** The average time it takes to restore a system after a failure.

    *(Visualizing the Indicators: MTBF is the period between failures, MTTF is Mean Time To Failure, MTTR is the time spent repairing.)*

#### 2. HA Configuration Types: Hot Standby

*   **Also known as:** Active-Standby.
*   **Structure:** The simplest HA clustering setup.
    *   **Active Server:** Processes all operations.
    *   **Standby Server:** Powered on and running its operating system, ready to take over. (Sometimes used for development when not active).
*   **Fail-over Operation:**
    *   If the active server fails (due to hardware, network, or process issues), the failure is detected (often via a "heartbeat" network).
    *   All HA service operations are **automatically switched (fail-over)** to the standby server.

03 Latest  Technology  and Trends  of Information  Systems
Information  system infrastructure  is generally  implemented  by separately  purchasing  servers, storage, and network
devices  from each vendor, then integrating  them for the project. Moreover,  they also separately  purchase  software,
thus they need to test and verify if it works properly  with the hardware.  However,  such a complex  structure  and
procedure  inevitably  have led to inefficiency  from the implementation  time and system management  aspect.
The converged  infrastructure  is a concept  introduced  to solve the problem.  It integrates  the hardware,  like storage,
server, and network,  with the virtualization  solution and the management  software,  supplied  by each vendor, into a
product  and validates  it in advance  for supply  to customers  (see [Figure  87]).

However,  despite the advantage  that the converged  infrastructure  enabled  quick service implementation,  through
the integration and validation  in advance,  it was not actually  well received  in the market,due  to its poor performance
compared  to input resources.  Since the product  integrates  the server, the network,  and the external  storage,  the cost
was exceptionally  high, and the system had a problem  with scalability.  In particular,  the high-performance  external
storage  was a severe burden from the cost and structural  aspect.

expensive  external  storage.  As shown in [Figure 88], HCI groups the direct attached  storage  (DAS), which is located
under a general-purpose  x86 server, with the software-defined  storage  (SDS) technology  through  the IP-based
network  and uses it as a storage pool, similar to a storage  area network  (SAN). The architecture  eliminates  the
structural  complexity  and reduces  costs most of all by eliminating  external  storage.

“Blocked  wagesfer’,  The Hankyore.
Information  systems  have the role of not only supporting  business,  but also creating  business.  A failed bank
information  system can have an enormous  impact. A fire at OO Card's IDC center in 2014 is a similar  case.
Enterprises  must improve  the availability of information  system services,  through a high availability  (HA)
configuration  or disaster  recovery  (DR) center in order to ensure that their information  system safely and
continuously provides  service. Most major information  systems  are basically  configured  with redundancy.
An important  banking  system has a spare system, in addition  to redundancy,  to ensure that the reserve
system can continue  to provide information  services  at the time of disasters,  such as an earthquake  or
a fire. The DR center is a place that provides  such a spare system.  DR centers are configured  in different
ways, depending  on the importance  of the information  system.  When  a failure or disaster  occurs, the time
required  to recover  in order to provide normal service is called the recovery  time objective  (RTO). Moreover,
the tolerable  level of data loss in a failure or disaster  is called a recovery  point objective  (RPO). The DR
center is classified  into a mirror, hot, warm, or cold site...
