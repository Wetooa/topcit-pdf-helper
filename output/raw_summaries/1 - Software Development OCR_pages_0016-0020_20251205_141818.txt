## Software Development: An Essential Guide

### 1. The Growing Importance of Software

**Key Idea:** Software is no longer just a support tool; it's a primary driver of business and innovation across all industries.

*   **Market Growth:** The global software market was valued at **USD 1.27 trillion in 2014**, rapidly increasing its share of the total ICT market.
*   **"Software is Devouring the World":** This phrase describes how software drives digital transformation and creates new business models.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Uber & Airbnb:** World's largest transportation and accommodation services, yet they own no cars or hotels – their power comes from software.
        *   **Traditional Companies:** Even manufacturing giants (GE) and financial institutions (Goldman Sachs) now see themselves as software companies.
        *   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Technologies like Google DeepMind's AlphaGo demonstrate software's immense potential, enriching daily life (communication, education, shopping).
        *   **Autonomous Driving:** Once dominated by mechanical engineering, cars now rely heavily on software code, with over half the industry moving towards software-centric design.
*   **Conclusion:** Systematic software development and management are crucial for system quality and development productivity.

### 2. Challenges in Software Development

**Problem:** Despite its growing importance, software quality and development productivity often lag, leading to significant issues.

*   **Quality Concerns:**
    *   Software, by its nature, is prone to defects.
    *   Increased use (e.g., mobile apps used by many users simultaneously) can lead to unintended defects when optimizing for efficiency.
    *   Ensuring quality is critical, especially in life-related applications (e.g., autonomous driving).
*   **Industry Issues (Common Excuses & Obstacles):**
    *   **Budget/Manpower Shortages:** Industries often overlook quality due to perceived lack of resources.
    *   **Cost & Time:** Prioritizing quality naturally increases development time and cost.
    *   **Pricing Difficulties:** Challenges in accurately pricing software projects.
    *   **Developer Shortage:** A lack of skilled software developers.
    *   **SI Project Culture:** A development culture heavily centered on System Integration (SI) projects can hinder best practices.
*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Past:** Smaller projects could rely on individual programmer experience.
    *   **Present:** Large projects with hundreds of developers face communication, schedule, cost, and complex/changing requirements issues.

### 3. Introduction to Software Engineering

**Definition:** Software Engineering is the application of systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approaches to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

*   **Purpose:** To successfully develop increasingly complex and multi-functional software by providing **systematic management technologies and techniques** across the entire lifecycle (from requirements analysis to maintenance).
*   **Goal:** To achieve the highest quality software and promote productivity.
*   **Key Elements for Success (3 Pillars):** To effectively apply software engineering, three elements must be balanced and continuously maintained:
    1.  **Process & Methods:** Systematic business methods and workflow definitions. (e.g., "Procedures & Methods" in the diagram)
    2.  **Organization & People:** Personnel equipped with specialized knowledge and skills. (e.g., "Organization & People" in the diagram)
    3.  **Tools & Infrastructure:** Technology and equipment needed for efficient operation. (e.g., "Tools & Equipment" in the diagram)

### 4. Background and the "Software Crisis"

**Key Concept:** The "Software Crisis" was a period when the demand for software outpaced the ability to produce reliable, high-quality, and cost-effective software.

*   **1950s:** The idea of applying engineering principles (like hardware engineering) to software development first emerged.
*   **1960s:** **Software Engineering was formally introduced in response to the "Software Crisis."**
    *   **Causes of the Crisis:**
        *   Rapidly increasing demand for software.
        *   Lack of experienced and competent engineers.
        *   Lack of systematic approaches to software development.
*   **1970s:**
    *   Developer scarcity worsened as demand continued to grow.
    *   Projects often assigned to individuals without formal software development backgrounds.
    *   **"Coding First and Correction Later" Approach:** A common, flawed belief that software could be easily modified during development, leading to:
        *   Many defects.
        *   Unreliable software.
        *   Costly rework.
    *   **Response:** This crisis spurred the development of structural and formal techniques, such as the **Waterfall model**, to bring discipline to software development.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
In June 2015, Gartner, a research  company  specializing  in the IT field, announced  that the global
software  market in 2014 was worth USD 1 trillion and 269.2 billion, that software  was occupying
an ever greater  share of the entire ICT market, and that the influence  of software  in all industries
was rapidly increasing  as all industries  were becoming  “smart” and using “smart data’. Therefore,
systematic  software  development  and management  has become  an important  factor in determining
system  quality  and improving  development  productivity.

+ Preview  for practical  business What if we don’t have sufficient software
development  and management  capabilities?
“Software  is devouring  the world.”
These words accurately  describe  the current  situation  facing companies.  As we enter the intelligent
information  society represented  by Industry  4.0, software  has emerged  as a key driver of digital
transformation  and enterprises  have their competitors  strained in the industry  by creating  a new
business  model that did not exist before the widespread  adoption  of software.  We can see evidence
for this in the way that Uber and Airbnb have stablished  themselves  as the providers  of the world’s
largest transportation  service and its largest accommodation  service, respectively,  even though
they do not own any cars or hotels. As a result, many enterprises  all over the world are trying to
strengthen their software  capabilities  for digital business.  The impact is so far-reaching  that even
the manufacturing  company  GE and the financial company  Goldman  Sachs also see themselves  as
software  companies.  We can easily find evidence  of the newly elevated  status of software  all around
us. Artificial  intelligence  (Al) is the most representative  example.  “AlphaGo’,  which was introduced
to the world by Google DeepMind  a few years ago, became  an important  measure  by which we can
estimate the extent  to which the power of software  will develop.  At present,  Al enriches  our lives
considerably  as it is utilized in diverse fields in our daily lives, such as communication,  education,
shopping,  entertainment,  vehicle  management,  etc.
Autonomous  driving, which has been actively  researched  and developed  throughout  the world,
also belongs  to the software  domain. Until very recently,  mechanical  engineering  elements  had a
dominant  place in the car and electric  apparatus  industries,  which were even referred  to as the “flowers
of the manufacturing  sector’. However,  more than half of the industries  are now composed  of
software  code. In particular,  the car industry  depends  increasingly  heavily on software  as self-driving
technology  is increasingly  incorporated  into new models.
Even though such important  software  is increasingly  being used in more areas, the pertinent  question
is whether  software  quality is being managed,  and productivity  being improved,  in proportion  to
the increased  use. In particular,  it is necessary  to examine  whether  software  functions  are working
properly  as the use of software  is increasing  even in areas directly  related to human life or property,
such as autonomous  driving. However,  the reality is that software  quality cannot be considered  in
the domestic  software  industry.  For example,  more mobile apps are now used as smartphones  have
become  so popular. However,  these mobiles  apps are not used by a single user but rather are called
by several users at the same time. Therefore, unintended  defects  can occur while seeking  to improve
service  efficiency.

As such, even though software  is prone to be defective  due to its intrinsic nature, the domestic
software  industry  tends to overlook  it on such pretexts  as a lack of budget or a shortage  of
manpower.  One can understand  their view that they don’t have any other options. It is natural
that the software  development  period and cost increase  when quality is taken into account.  This
phenomenon  is further aggravated  by continuous  issues that have been pointed  out for a long time,
but which still have not been resolved,  namely, the difficulty  of getting  the right software  price, the
lack of developers,  a ...
