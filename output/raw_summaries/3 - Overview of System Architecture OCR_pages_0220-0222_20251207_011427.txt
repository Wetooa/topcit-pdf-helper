## Learning Guide: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) & Its Relationship with SDN

### 1. Introduction to NFV

#### 1.1. Background: Why NFV?
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) faced challenges with traditional network equipment:
*   **Space & Power:** Rapidly increasing equipment requires more physical space and power.
*   **Lifespan & Profit:** Equipment lifespans are short, making it hard to profit from new introductions.
NFV was created to solve these issues using **virtualization technology**.

#### 1.2. What is NFV?
*   NFV runs on a **high-performance x86 platform** (standard computer processor architecture).
*   It allows users to activate necessary network functions **on-demand**.
*   It creates **Virtual Machines (VMs)** or service profiles to virtualize network functions using x86 capabilities.

### 2. NFV Architecture Framework

The NFV architecture consists of three main function groups:

1.  **VNF Group (Virtual Network Functions)**
    *   Software implementations of network functions (e.g., router, firewall).
    *   A set of network features to support multiple applications.

2.  **NFVI (NFV Infrastructure)**
    *   Provides physical hardware resources: computing, storage, and networking.
    *   Includes functions to support virtualization and VNF execution.

3.  **Management & Orchestration (MANO)**
    *   Manages hardware and software resources.
    *   Handles delivery and management of VNFs.

### 3. NFV Application Cases

*   NFV implements network equipment functions using virtualization.
*   It operates on **general high-performance x86 server platforms** instead of specialized hardware.
*   **Example:** A firewall function can run on common servers and switches, virtualized as a VNF.

### 4. SDN and NFV: A Complementary Relationship

*   **Origins:**
    *   **SDN (Software-Defined Networking):** Started with researchers and data center designers.
    *   **NFV:** Developed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
*   **Current Trend:** ISPs now combine both technologies due to their complementary nature.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **SDN:** Creates an abstracted network, enabling **faster innovation and changes**.
    *   **NFV:** Reduces **CAPEX (Capital Expenditures)**, **OPEX (Operating Expenditures)**, and resource consumption (space, power).
*   **Independence:** While complementary, NFV and SDN can also be configured and used independently.

### 5. Comparison: SDN vs. NFV

Overview  of System Architecture )
@ Background  of NFV
With the increase  in network speed and the emergence  of various services,  securing  space and power to
accommodate  the rapidly increasing  network  equipment  has become  a crucial issue for Internet  service providers.
Moreover,  the lifespan of network  equipment  is shortened,  making  it increasingly  difficult  to secure profits after
introducing  new equipment.  NFV was introduced  to solve these problems  through  virtualization  technology.
@ Concept  of NFV
NFV runs on a high-performance  x86 platform  and allows users to activate  the necessary  network  functions  as
needed.  It creates  a VM (Virtual Machine)  or service profile and implements  virtualization  on the network  by utilizing
the x86 capabilities,
@® NFV architecture  framework  structure
As shown in <Table 76>, the NFV architecture  framework  consists of  three function  groups: VNF group, NFV
infrastructure,  and management  and orchestration.

@ NFV application  cases
NFV uses virtualization  to implement  network  equipment  functions.  It not only operates  on specialized  equipment,
but also implements  the network  equipment  functions  in a general high-performance  x86 server platform,  as shown
in [Figure 154].

D) SDN and NFV
Initially, SDN was developed  mainly by researchers  and data center designers,  and NFV was developed  by Internet
service providers  (ISPs). However,  SDN and NFV technologies  are complementary  to each other, and ISPs currently
combine  the two technologies  and apply them to networks.

[Figure 155] Relationship  between  NFV SDN [8]
SDN enables  faster change by creating  an abstracted  network,  and NFV reduces  capital expenditures  (CAPEX),
operating  expenditures  (OPEX), and space and resource  consumption.  NFV and SDN have a complementary
relationship  and can be independently  configured.
