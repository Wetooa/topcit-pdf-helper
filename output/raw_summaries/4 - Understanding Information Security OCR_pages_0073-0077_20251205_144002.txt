## Application Security & Secure Coding Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction: Why Secure Coding Matters

*   **Problem:** Most cyber-attacks exploit weaknesses in software.
*   **Impact:** About **70% of cyber-attacks** use software vulnerabilities.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Fixing security vulnerabilities *during* development is **tens of times cheaper** than fixing them after the software is released.
*   **Solution:** Secure coding is crucial for developing secure applications and preventing cyber-attacks.

### 2. What is Secure Coding?

*   **Definition:** Secure coding is a defensive programming technique used to:
    *   Reduce software vulnerabilities.
    *   Minimize hacking risks.
    *   Achieve this by removing security weaknesses throughout the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

### 3. Key Concepts: Weakness vs. Vulnerability

It's important to distinguish between software weaknesses and vulnerabilities:

*   **Software Weakness:**
    *   **What it is:** Errors or flaws occurring in the software's design or implementation (e.g., defects, bugs).
    *   **Effect:** A weakness *can lead to* a security vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)** lists common software weaknesses.
*   **Security Vulnerability:**
    *   **What it is:** A specific error in software that can be *exploited* by hackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.
    *   **Effect:** Allows hackers to use the weakness for malicious purposes.
    *   **Example:** **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** lists publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

### 4. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)

The Secure SDLC integrates security activities into every phase of software development, rather than treating security as an afterthought.

**Goals of SSDLC:**
*   Define security objectives early.
*   Analyze threats and potential impact.
*   Design and implement security from the ground up.
*   Continuously test and verify security.

**Phases and Key Security Activities:**

1.  **Requirement Definition Phase:**
    *   Define security objectives based on project/software characteristics.
    *   Analyze potential threats, weaknesses, and their impact.
    *   Derive specific security requirements for development.

2.  **Analysis/Design Phase:**
    *   Design the overall security architecture.
    *   Incorporate security requirements into the architecture design.
    *   Implement developer security training.
    *   Plan security testing strategies.

3.  **Coding Phase:**
    *   Define secure coding rules specific to the programming language being used.
    *   Conduct static unit tests on developed code to check for adherence to secure coding rules.
    *   Verify compliance with predefined secure coding standards.
    *   For commercial packages, check for known security vulnerabilities and recommended actions.

4.  **Testing Phase:**
    *   Conduct dynamic unit tests on the running program.
    *   Test the usability of security features in the application.
    *   Identify and derive improvements by independently checking infrastructure and application vulnerabilities.

5.  **Maintenance Phase:**
    *   When modifying code, evaluate the security impact of changes.
    *   Periodically check for new vulnerabilities.
    *   Derive and apply security improvements as needed.

### 5. Major Secure Coding Techniques (Example: Java)

#### A) Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

**1. Attack Overview:**

*   **How it works:** Attackers exploit web applications that don't properly validate user input.
*   **Mechanism:** They insert malicious SQL statements into input forms or URL fields.
*   **Result:** This allows them to read, modify, or delete information from the database without authorization.

**2. Coding Technique (Prevention):**

To prevent SQL Injection, avoid directly concatenating user input into SQL queries.

*   **Use Prepared Statements:**
    *   **Method:** Use objects like Java's `PreparedStatement`. These compile the SQL query *before* inserting user-provided values.
    *   **Benefit:** The database treats external input as data, not executable code, preventing it from changing the query's structure.
*   **Filter Special Characters/Reserved Words:**
    *   Even with `PreparedStatement`, it's good practice to filter potentially malicious characters or SQL reserved words from user input.
*   **Leverage Framework Security Modules:**
    *   If using frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring), utilize their built-in input validation and security modules to handle external input securely.

**Example: Unsafe vs. Safe Code (Conceptual)**

*   **Unsafe Code:** Directly adds user input (`gubun`) to the SQL query string.
    ```java
    // String sql = "select ... where b_gubun =" + gubun + ";";
    // If gubun is "a' OR '1'='1", the query becomes malicious.
    ```
*   **Safe Code:** Uses a placeholder `?` in the query and sets the parameter separately using `PreparedStatement`.
    ```java
    // String sql = "select ... where b_gubun = ?";
    // PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql);
    // pstmt.setString(1, gubun); // 'gubun' is treated purely as data.
    ```

+ Preview  for practical business
Recently,  company  A is building  a website  that strengthens  security,  due to the vulnerability  of
personal  information,  and is considering  secure  coding  to improve  security.
1) The company  is trying to apply secure SDLC.
2) The customer  and the development  company  consider  secure coding in the requirement  definition
stage.
3) The company  considers  secure design when designing  analysis,  from the perspective  of
architecture.
4) Developers  review their codes in the development  phase and the quality control department
performs  a third-party  security  check.
5) The company  considers  secure coding  diagnostic  tools for review in the operation  and maintenance
stage.
However,  developers  are having difficulty  in the development  process,  due to the lack of
understanding  on secure  coding  and the lack of training  on security  vulnerabilities.
Let’s review secure coding that should be applied throughout  the development  lifecycle  to build an
application  with strong security.

01 Need for securing  coding
A) Need for secure  coding
It was analyzed  that about 70% of cyber-attacks  exploit  the security  vulnerability  of software  itself. It was also
analyzed  that modification costs can be reduced by tens of times, compared  to the cost of modification after
the product  release.
Accordingly,  removing  security  vulnerabilities in the software  development  phase is highlighted  as an effective
method  before releasing  the product,  to prevent  and respond  to cyber-attacks.
Secure coding  is a defensive  programming  technique  that reduces  software  vulnerabilities  and hacking  risks, by
removing  security  weaknesses  in the software  development  lifecycle  (SDLC).
02 Main content  of secure  coding
A) Software  security  weakness  and security  vulnerability
@ Weakness:  Errors occurring  in the design and implementation  phase, such as software  defects, errors, and bugs.
Software  weakness  can cause software  vulnerabilities.  A representative  example is the Common  Weakness
Enumeration  (CWE).
® Vulnerability:  An error in software  that can be accessed  and used by hackers,  by accessing  the system or network.
Hackers  can exploit  this accessible  security  weakness.  An example  is the Common  Vulnerabilities  and Exposures  (CVE).

Coding rules are defined by checking  the weaknesses  and strengths  of the used programming  language  from
a security  perspective.  The static unit test of the developed  code is conducted,  and compliance  with the
predefined  secure coding rules are verified.  When a commercial  package  is used, security  vulnerability  content
