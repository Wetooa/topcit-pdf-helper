## Network Security Essentials: A Learning Guide

This guide condenses key concepts, models, and protocols related to network security.

---

### **1. Network Security Model**

A computer network facilitates data transmission between sender and receiver. Security measures protect this data.

**Key Security Elements:**
*   **Conversion:** Transforming data for security.
    *   **Encryption:** Mixing messages to prevent understanding by attackers.
    *   **Hashing:** Adding a code based on message content for sender identification.
*   **Secret Information:** Confidential data shared by communicating parties (e.g., **encryption keys**). Attackers should not know this.
*   **Trusted Third Party (TTP):**
    *   **Role:** Distributes secret information (like keys) securely to both parties.
    *   **Function:** Mediates disputes if they arise.

**Conditions for a General Network Security Model:**
1.  **Secure Algorithm Design:** The conversion algorithm must be designed so attackers cannot break its purpose.
2.  **Secret Information Creation:** Generate necessary confidential data for the algorithm.
3.  **Secure Distribution Method:** Develop a way to distribute and share this secret information.
4.  **Protocol Designation:** Define a specific security algorithm and protocol for the communicating parties using the secret information.

### **2. Network Access Security Model**

This model addresses how to protect systems from unauthorized access and attacks (hackers, viruses, worms).

**Two Categories of Security Responses:**
1.  **Denying Access (Gatekeeper Function):**
    *   **Purpose:** Prevents unauthorized users from entering the system.
    *   **Example:** Login procedures with passwords.
2.  **Internal Security Control:**
    *   **Purpose:** Monitors and controls activity *after* initial access to detect intruders or malware.
    *   **Example:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

---

### **3. Communication Protocol Layers and Security**

Network communication is often described using layered models.

#### **A. OSI 7-Layer Reference Model**

A standard model (ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994(E)) for open system interconnection.

| Layer           | Function                                                | Example Protocols                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **7. Application** | Provides services to users (e.g., interface, email, DB). | HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, FTP, Telnet, SSH, DNS                 |
| **6. Presentation** | Converts/formats data for common representation.        | JPEG, MPEG, XDR                                         |
| **5. Session**  | Manages communication sessions (establishes, maintains, synchronizes). | TLS, RPC, NetBIOS                                       |
| **4. Transport** | End-to-end data transmission and error control.         | TCP, UDP, SCTP                                          |
| **3. Network**  | Routes packets from source to destination across networks. | IP, IPX, ICMP, X.25, ARP, OSPF                          |
| **2. Data Link** | Transfers frames between devices without errors.        | Ethernet, Token Ring, Wireless LAN                      |
| **1. Physical** | Converts bits to signals and transmits via physical media. | Radio wave, Coaxial cable, UTP, Optical fiber           |

#### **B. TCP/IP Protocol Layer Structure**

An older model (from ARPANET) widely used for the Internet, often described with 4 layers.

*   **Application Layer:**
    *   **Corresponds to:** OSI Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
    *   **Function:** Provides high-level application services (e.g., web, DNS, FTP, email).
*   **Transport Layer (Host-to-Host):**
    *   **Corresponds to:** OSI Transport layer.
    *   **Function:** Manages data exchange between application programs (virtual ports).
    *   **Protocols:** TCP, UDP, SCTP.
*   **Internet Layer (Network Layer):**
    *   **Corresponds to:** OSI Network layer.
    *   **Function:** Manages addressing (IP addresses) and routing functions.
    *   **Protocols:** IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP.
*   **Network Interface Layer (Network Access Layer):**
    *   **Corresponds to:** OSI Data Link and Physical layers combined.
    *   **Function:** Transfers TCP/IP packets over physical media (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi). Handles MAC functions and electrical signals.

---

### **4. Security Functions by Layer**

Initially, TCP/IP lacked built-in security. Security protocols were added later, often mapping to OSI layers.

*   **Application Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **Email Security:** PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), S/MIME.
    *   **Authentication:** Kerberos.
    *   **Secure Remote Access:** SSH (Secure Shell).
*   **Transport Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **SSL (Secure Socket Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security):**
        *   **Function:** Provides secure transport services to the application layer.
        *   **Relationship:** TLS is the IETF standard successor to SSL.
        *   **Features:** Offers end-to-end security and data integrity.
*   **Internet Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **IPSec (IP Security):**
        *   **Function:** Provides authentication and encryption at the Internet layer.
        *   **Application:** Used to implement VPN (Virtual Private Network) services.

---

### **5. Types of Network Attacks and Countermeasures (DoS Attack)**

#### **A. DoS Attack (Denial of Service)**

*   **Goal:** Disrupt normal server operation by causing various types of load.
*   **Target:** Availability (one of the core security services).

**Types of DoS Attacks:**

1.  **Land Attack:**
    *   **Method:** Sends a packet to the target where the source IP address is spoofed to be the same as the destination IP address (the target's own IP).
    *   **Impact:** The target server enters an infinite loop of sending and receiving the packet to itself, leading to IP protocol stack failure and server crash.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Block incoming packets where the source IP address matches the server's own IP address, using a router or packet filtering tool.

2.  **Ping of Death Attack:**
    *   **Method:** Sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packet that is intentionally much larger than the normal size. This large packet is fragmented during transmission.
    *   **Impact:** (Implied) When the target tries to reassemble the oversized packet, it can lead to system instability or crashes.

@ Network  security  model
A computer  network  consists  of communication  objects,  such as computers  and communication  systems  (a set
of transmission  devices and communication  lines). The computer  network  exists to support  data transmission
between  the sending  computer  and receiving  computer,  regardless  of the distance.
{Figure 55] is an abstract  expression  of network  communication  elements  from the perspective  of security.
A single message  is sent from the sender to the receiver  through a network,  like the Internet.  Two
communication  subjects  should cooperate  with each other to exchange  messages  in this process.  A logical
information  channel (a path consisting  of numerous  communication  devices  is allocated  between  the sending
computer  and the receiving  computer,  which is used to transfer  data) is established  by setting the Internet
path between  the message  source and destination,  negotiating  between  the two communication  subjects.
If transmission  data needs to be protected  from attacks  on confidentiality  and authentication,  corresponding
security  measures  are started.  All mechanisms  for security  should include  the following  two elements:
* Conversion,  related to the security of  the data to be sent, belongs  to this. For example,  encryption  that
mixes messages  to prevent  attackers  from understanding  the message  or adding a code (hash code), based
on the message  content  to identify  the sender, belong  to this.
+ For example,  encryption  keys belong  to this, which are used to convert  the message  (confidential  information
shared by two communicating  subjects  that is unknown  to the attacker)  before sending  it, and to convert  it
again after receiving  the message.

A trusted  third party may be needed for secure transmission.  For example,  a third party may distribute  secret
information,  such as encryption  keys, to both communication  subjects  to prevent  attackers  from knowing  it or
may mediate  a dispute  when it occurs.
A general network  security  model should meet the following  four basic conditions  when designing  a specific
security  service:
+ Design should be an algorithm  design that performs  conversion  related to security.  An attacker  should not be

Information  security )
able to destroy  the purpose  of conversion  in the design.
+ Secret information,  to be used by the conversion  algorithm,  should be created.
+ A method  for distributing  and sharing  confidential  information  should be developed.
+A security  algorithm  for a specific security  service and a protocol,  to be used by the two communicating
entities  that will use secret information,  should be designated.
@® Network  access  security  model
An attacker  tries to infiltrate  into the information  system to damage it or to destroy  or steal personal
information.  In addition,  malware,  such as a virus or worm, can infect the information  system through  the
network.
Security  response  techniques against such unwanted  access can be divided into two categories,  as shown
in [Figure 56]. The first category  is the method of denying  access to the information  system, except for the
authorized  users, using the gate keeper  function.  The log-in procedure  using a password  falls into this category.
Once accessed  by the user or software,  the second-phase  response  is performed  by the internal security
control function.  An intrusion  detection  system (IDS) that monitors  the activity status of an information
system and detects  an intruder  can be selected  as the representative  method of performing  internal security
control.
