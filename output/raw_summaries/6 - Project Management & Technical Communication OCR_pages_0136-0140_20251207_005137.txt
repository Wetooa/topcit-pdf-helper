## Project Management & Technical Communication Learning Guide

This guide condenses pages 136-140, focusing on essential project management tools, concepts, and evaluation methods.

### 1. Project Management Tools

Effective project management relies on various tools to track progress, manage risks, and control configurations.

#### A. Project Progress Tracking Management Tool
*   **Purpose:** Monitors overall project schedule, tasks, allocated resources, and their completion rates.
*   **Function:** Provides visibility into project advancement and remaining work.
*   *Example: A Gantt chart or task list showing work names, periods, dates, resources, and progress percentages.*

#### B. Risk Management System (RMS)
*   **Purpose:** Monitors and controls project-related issues and risks from project initiation to completion.
*   **Function:** Manages identified issues and potential risks systematically, similar to how requirements are managed with a traceability matrix.
*   *Example: An issue tracking log listing issues, their status, creation/update dates, and planned actions.*

#### C. Configuration Management System (CMS)
*   **Purpose:** Systematically manages source codes and project deliverables in collaborative environments.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Prevents duplicate revisions (multiple people making the same change independently).
    *   Avoids loss of updated content.
    *   Tracks the history of source codes and deliverables.
    *   Performs version control (managing different iterations of files).
*   **Popular Tools:**
    *   **CVS (Concurrent Versions System):** Older version control system.
    *   **Subversion (SVN):** Successor to CVS, improved features.
    *   **Git:** Distributed version control system, widely used today.
*   **Tool Comparison (Common Features):**
    *   **Language Irrelevant:** Work with any programming language.
    *   **OS Support:** Generally support Windows, Linux, Mac.
    *   **Interface:** Primarily command-line, but often complemented by third-party Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools (e.g., TortoiseCVS, TortoiseSVN, SourceTree for Git).

### 2. Advantages of Using a Project Management System

Implementing a comprehensive project management system offers several key benefits:

*   **Successful Project Management:**
    *   Provides full visibility into project progress.
    *   Helps identify completed and remaining tasks.
    *   Enables managing the project according to the plan.
*   **Effective Team Management:**
    *   Facilitates efficient assignment of tasks to team members.
    *   Simplifies schedule management and role allocation.
    *   Contributes to achieving overall project goals.
*   **Improvement of Organizational Competence:**
    *   Records project history and deliverables, creating valuable organizational assets.
    *   Serves as a reference model for future, similar projects.
    *   Boosts the organization's overall performance capability.

### 3. Concept of Project Monitoring and Evaluation

#### A. Definition and Purpose
*   **Definition:** The process of assessing whether a project has been completed within the planned timeframe, stayed within budget, and achieved its objectives.
*   **Reasons for Evaluation:**
    1.  **Assess IT Investment Value:** Determine how much IT investment contributed to business goal achievement.
    2.  **Learn and Improve:** Identify problems or issues during the project (retrospective) to reflect on and improve future projects.

#### B. Aspects of Project Evaluation
Projects are typically evaluated from three key perspectives:

1.  **Financial Perspective:** Evaluates investment costs and Return on Investment (ROI).
2.  **Management Perspective:** Assesses the project's progress processes, including:
    *   Schedule management
    *   Scope management
    *   Quality management
    *   Risk management
3.  **Technical Perspective:** Reviews the technologies and solutions applied within the project.

### 4. Project Evaluation Process and PMO

#### A. Project Evaluation
*   **Scope:** Involves evaluating everything from the project's start to the post-completion investment.
*   **Importance:** Crucial for companies managing multiple projects and significant investments, requiring systematic management and fair ex-post evaluation.

#### B. Project Management Office (PMO)
*   **Role:** A Project Management Office (PMO) often facilitates systematic project evaluation.
*   **PMO Activities Related to Evaluation:**
    *   **Integrated Management:** Oversees various project management areas (e.g., scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk).
    *   **Investment Decision-making:** Supports decisions using analyses like SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
    *   **Investment Evaluation Management:** Manages the evaluation process, including initial entry, results analysis, and gap analysis.

#### C. Example Project Evaluation Items
Key criteria used to evaluate a project's success and value:

*   Return on Investment (ROI)
*   Business Strategy Consistency
*   Sales Increase Effect
*   Cost Reduction Effect
*   User Satisfaction
*   Competitive Differentiation
*   Process Improvement
*   Recycle/Reusability

#### D. Performance Measurement
*   **Purpose:** Quantitatively verify if the project achieved its stated goals (e.g., based on business case, project charter).
*   **Method:** Often involves measuring key metrics (e.g., monthly sales for a new system) over time to assess performance and inform future operations and improvements.

### 5. Project Evaluation Stages

Project evaluation is conducted at different points in the project lifecycle:

*   **Ex-ante Evaluation:** Conducted **before** the project begins. Focuses on feasibility, justification, and alignment with business goals.
*   **Interim Evaluation:** Conducted **during** the project's execution. Monitors progress, identifies issues, and allows for corrective actions.
*   **Ex-post Evaluation:** Conducted **after** the project is completed. Assesses final outcomes, ROI, lessons learned, and overall impact.

Project  managers  must monitor  and control the project  from initiation  to the end of the project for numerous
issues and risks. In the same way that requirements are managed  using a Requirement  Traceability  Matrix,
issues and risks are also managed  using an issue management  tool, and the figure below is an issue and re-
quirements  management  software.
