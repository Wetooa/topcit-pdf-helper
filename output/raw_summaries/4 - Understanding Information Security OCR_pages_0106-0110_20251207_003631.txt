## **Learning Guide: Network Security Fundamentals**

### **Section 1: Essential Network Services & FTP Security**

#### **1. Common Network Services (with Port Numbers)**

| Service Name | Port | Description |
| :----------- | :--- | :---------- |
| **Uucp**      | 540  | Copies files between Unix systems; sends commands to other systems. |
| **Ingreslock** | 1524 | Ingres database lock service. |
| **Dtspcd**     | 6112 | Daemon to control desktop subprocesses. |
| **Daytime**    | 13   | Displays current time and date in ASCII to clients. |
| **Tftp**       | 69   | Trivial File Transfer Protocol. |
| **Uucp-path**  | 117  | Uucp path service. |
| **Netbios_ns** | 137  | NetBIOS name service for network resource identification. |
| **Bftp**       | 152  | Binary File Transfer Protocol. |
| **Talk**       | 517  | Allows remote users to start chat sessions with others. |
| **Pcserver**   | 600  | ECD integrated PC board server; used in RPC attacks. |

#### **2. FTP Security: Why SFTP is Crucial**

*   **Risks of Anonymous FTP:**
    *   Allows attackers to gather system information.
    *   If write permissions are enabled, it creates severe vulnerabilities for various attacks.
    *   **Recommendation:** Restrict anonymous FTP to only essential users and ensure write permissions are not set.

*   **Vulnerabilities of General FTP (Non-Secure):**
    *   **Plain Text Transmission:** Sends user authentication information (username, password) without encryption, making it vulnerable to interception.
    *   **Protocol Weaknesses:** Susceptible to **brute force attacks** (guessing credentials) and **sniffing attacks** (capturing plain text data) to gain unauthorized account access.

*   **Solution: Use Secure FTP (SFTP)**
    *   **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)** encrypts all data, including login credentials, during transmission.
    *   **Recommendation:** Always use an SFTP server and client for secure file transfers.

*   **Implementing SFTP with Java (Conceptual):**
    *   Use an SFTP open-source library (e.g., Apache Commons-Net).
    *   Steps involve importing necessary libraries, establishing an SFTP connection using a secure URI (e.g., `sftp://user:pass@server/path`), and then copying files securely.

### **Section 2: Understanding Network Security Principles**

#### **1. Importance and Key Trends**

*   **Rapid Internet Growth:** The internet, including wired/wireless communication and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, is deeply embedded in all aspects of life.
*   **Security as a Core Challenge:** Security-related issues are the most critical barriers to utilizing the internet for real-world applications like remote medical treatment and e-commerce.
*   **Essential Protective Technologies:** Key technologies to defend against network security threats include:
    *   **Firewall:** Filters network traffic based on predefined security rules.
    *   **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts on potential threats.

#### **2. Learning Objectives**

Upon completion, you should be able to:
*   Classify network attack types and describe corresponding responses.
*   Explain key network security technologies and major solutions.
*   Describe wireless LAN security standards (IEEE 802.11i) and technologies.
*   Understand the principles and applications of **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**.
*   Explain and apply security principles for various application layer protocols.

#### **3. Key Terms**

*   **Firewall**
*   **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
*   **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**
*   **Traffic attack**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
*   **IPSec** (Internet Protocol Security)
*   **Transmission mode** (IPSec concept)
*   **Tunnel mode** (IPSec concept)
*   **Sniffing** (Interception of data)
*   **Spoofing** (Impersonation)
*   **Key management**
*   **NAT** (Network Address Translation)
*   **DMZ** (Demilitarized Zone)
*   **WLAN** (Wireless Local Area Network)
*   **IEEE 802.11i** (WLAN security standard)
*   **4-way handshake** (WLAN security authentication)
*   **OWASP Top 10** (Common web application security risks)
*   **Anonymous FTP**

#### **4. Practical Scenario: Building a Secure Network with Firewall and DMZ**

*   **Goal:** Improve network security for a company (90 internal PCs, database, web server) by deploying a **firewall** and segmenting the network into external, internal, and **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** areas.
*   **Key Configuration Steps:**
    *   Assign **private IPs** (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) to internal PCs and the database server.
    *   Place the **web server** in the **DMZ**, retaining its existing public IP address.
    *   Subnet the existing public IP bands for the **external** and **DMZ** networks.
    *   Utilize specific hardware: one router, one firewall, and two switches.
    *   *(This scenario highlights practical application of firewalls and network segmentation for security.)*

### **Section 3: Overview of Network Security Attacks**

#### **1. Classification of Security Attacks (X.800 Standard)**

Security attacks are broadly categorized into two types:
*   **Passive Attacks:** Attempts to gain information without altering system resources.
*   **Active Attacks:** Attempts to change system resources or affect operations.

#### **2. Types of Security Attacks**

##### **A. Passive Attacks**
*   **Definition:** Involves an attacker trying to **obtain or exploit system information** by observing data without modifying it.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Difficult to Detect:** Since data remains unchanged, these attacks are hard to notice.
    *   **Prevention is Key:** Focus on preventing attacks rather than detecting them.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Message Content Disclosure:** Eavesdropping to read the contents of transmitted messages.
    *   **Traffic Analysis (Traffic Attack):** Observing communication patterns (e.g., sender/receiver, frequency, message size) to infer information, even if the data itself is encrypted.

##### **B. Active Attacks**
*   **Definition:** Involves an attacker attempting to **alter system resources** or **impact system operations** by modifying transmitted data or creating false data.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Masquerading:** An entity (person or program) pretends to be another legitimate entity. Often combined with other active attacks.
    *   **Replay Attack:** Capturing a legitimate data transmission and then re-transmitting it later to produce an unauthorized effect (e.g., re-sending a login request).
    *   **Modification of Message:** Illegally altering parts of a legitimate message to change its meaning or purpose (e.g., changing a transaction amount).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:** Preventing legitimate users from accessing network services, resources, or information. This can be done by overwhelming the system or disrupting its functionality.

Pcserver  (600) ECD integrated  PC board server used to make RPC related attacks.
@ Restricting  the use of anonymous  FTP and using Secure FTP
Anonymous  FTP allows a malicious user to obtain information  about the system. Since various  attacks  can be
made if writing permission  is set in the directory,  the use of anonymous  FTP should be restricted  by setting
it in such a way that only necessary  users can gain access. Also, secure FTP should be used, rather than FTP
with weak security.
When using general FTP by using anonymous  FTP or by setting up an account,  there are security
vulnerabilities,  such as the transmission  of user authentication  information,  in plain text without  encryption,
and security  vulnerabilities  of the FTP protocol  itself, That is, FTP can acquire  account  privileges  by exploiting
the authentication  vulnerability  of the account  login and by applying  a brute force attack or a sniffing attack.
Therefore, when creating  an FTP program  for sending  and receiving  a file, an SFTP server should be installed
and an SFTP client program  should be written.
+ How to apply SFTP using Java
The SFTP open-source  library is used to create a SFTP client program using Java. Download  and install
Commons-Net  library from the Apache open-source  project site (http://commons.apache.org/proper/
commons-net/),  then write a SFTP client program  as follows:
// Import  libraries
import org.apache.commons.vfs2FileObject:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.FileSystemOptions:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.Selectors:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.impl.StandardFileSystemManager:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.providersftp.SftpFileSystemConfigBuilder:
| FTP connection  and file download
StandardFileSystemManager  manager  = new StandardFileSystemManager();
String sftpUri = “sftp://  + userld + *:” + password  + “@” + serverAddress  + “/” +
remoteDirectory  + fileToF  TP;
FileObject  localFile  = managerresolveFile(file,getAbsolutePath());
FileObject  remoteFile  = managerresolveFile(sftpUri,  opts);
remoteFile.copyFrom(localFile,  Selectors  SELECT  _SELF);
