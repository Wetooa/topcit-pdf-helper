# Software Development & Maintenance Learning Guide

## I. Version Control Systems (VCS)

**Version Control System (VCS):** A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later.

### A. Subversion (SVN)

*   **Type:** Open-source, centralized version control system.
*   **Abbreviation:** SVN (from its command-line interface).
*   **Origin:** Developed by CollabNet Inc. in 2000 to replace CVS. Now an Apache project.
*   **Model:** Server-client model.
    *   A central server stores the repository.
    *   Multiple **clients** (developers) check out and use files from this central server.

### B. Distributed Repository (Git)

*   **Type:** Distributed version control system (e.g., Git).
*   **Key Difference from Centralized:** Instead of just downloading a snapshot, clients **copy the entire repository**.
*   **Resilience:** If the central server fails, it can be restored using a copy held by any client.
*   **Storage:** Source codes can be saved in multiple servers or multiple developers' local PCs. Each becomes a source code **repository**.
*   **Branches:** Code is stored in different **branches** (versions). Different repositories can hold different combinations of these branches (e.g., Server A has branches A, B, C; Server B has A, C, D).
*   **No Master Version:** There is no single "master" version as branch versions differ across repositories.

### C. TFS (Team Foundation Server)

*   **Product:** Microsoft product.
*   **Features:** Comprehensive suite for software development, including:
    *   Source Code Management (Team Foundation Version Control)
    *   Reporting
    *   Requirements Management
    *   Project Management (Agile, Waterfall)
    *   Automated Build
    *   Lab Management
    *   Testing
    *   Release Management
*   **Integration:** Designed to work best with Microsoft Visual Studio or Eclipse.
*   **Architecture:** Integrated repository based on **SQL Server**. Stores all development activity information for team collaboration.

## II. Software Maintenance

### A. Importance of Software Maintenance

*   **High Cost:** Maintenance accounts for about **60%** of total software process costs and application lifecycle costs.
*   **Cost Breakdown:**
    *   **60%** on functional enhancement.
    *   **17%** on error correction.
    *   **18%** on adaptability (supporting other platforms).
    *   **5%** on refactoring (restructuring code without changing external behavior).
*   **Purpose:** To extend software's useful life, adapt to changes, correct errors, and improve performance.
*   **Vitality:** Well-maintained software remains "fit for use." Poor maintenance leads to obsolescence.
*   **Criticality:** More important and resource-intensive than initial development.

### B. Definition of Software Maintenance

*   **Phase:** The last phase of the **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**.
*   **Focus:** An operation-oriented phase.
*   **Goal:** To extend software life by:
    *   Correcting errors.
    *   Improving functions and performance.
    *   Adapting to changed environments or modifying original requirements.

### C. Purposes of Software Maintenance (Why it's important)

1.  Maintenance costs are often higher than initial development costs.
2.  Increased complexity of software leads to more administrative tasks (e.g., documentation).
3.  Software use periods are often longer than development periods, emphasizing ongoing management.
4.  Increased maintenance work due to the widespread use of package development.

### D. Types of Software Maintenance

Maintenance is classified by reason, time, and target.

#### 1. By Reason:

*   **Corrective Maintenance:** Fixing identified errors, bugs, or defects in the software.
*   **Adaptive Maintenance:** Modifying software to adapt to changes in the data environment, infrastructure, or platform (e.g., new OS version).
*   **Perfective Maintenance:** Enhancing software by adding new features, changing existing functionalities, or improving performance/quality (e.g., optimizing code).

#### 2. By Time:

*   **Scheduled Maintenance:** Planned, periodic maintenance performed at regular intervals.
*   **Preventive Maintenance:** Proactive measures taken to prevent future errors or performance degradation.
*   **Emergency Maintenance:** Urgent maintenance performed to address critical issues that require immediate attention (approval may follow later).

#### 3. By Target:

*   **Data/Program Maintenance:** Processing related to data conversion or changes in the program itself.
*   **Documentation Maintenance:** Updating or changing documentation (e.g., user manuals, technical specifications) to match software changes.
*   **System Maintenance:** Overall maintenance of the entire system.

## III. Software Maintenance Activities

### A. Software Maintenance Procedure

1.  **Understanding Current Software:**
    *   Analyze program structure, variables, data structures.
    *   Understand application field and business knowledge.
    *   Determine maintenance type and strategy (modification vs. new).
2.  **Requirements Analysis:**
    *   Identify specific targets for change (e.g., which program needs modification).
    *   Quickly understand how a maintenance request affects the existing system.
3.  **Identifying and Modifying the Scope of Impact:**
    *   Determine how software changes will affect existing functions.
    *   Perform necessary program changes and modifications.
    *   This step can be easy or require significant effort, depending on the software's **ease of maintenance**.
4.  **Test/Maintenance:**
    *   Perform testing to ensure changes work correctly and don't introduce new issues.
    *   Update documentation.
    *   Perform configuration management (version control of changes).

### B. Ease of Maintenance

**Ease of Maintenance:** A characteristic indicating how difficult it is to maintain software. Improving this during development is crucial.

*   **Ease of Use:** How easy it is to understand an application or program.
*   **Ease of Modification:** How easy it is to change an application or program.
*   **Ease of Testing:** How easy it is to verify the accuracy of an application or program.

### C. Improving Ease of Maintenance During Development

Systematic activities during development can significantly reduce future maintenance costs:

*   **Analysis Activities:** Clearly define customer requirements and constraints; validate product viability.
*   **Standards and Guidelines:** Establish various standards and guidelines to simplify future maintenance.
*   **Design Activities:** Prioritize clarity, modularity, and ease of change in design.
*   **Implementation Activities:** Apply standard structures and consistent coding styles.
*   **Supporting Documents:** Provide comprehensive guides and test manuals essential for maintenance activities.

### D. Software Maintenance Organizations

*   **Definition (IEEE/EIA 12207):** An organization or team responsible for performing maintenance activities.

B) Subversion  (SVN)
Subversion  is an open-source  version control system. It is also abbreviated  as “SVN” using the command  used
in the command-line  interface. Subversion  was first developed  by CollabNet  Inc. in 2000 to replace  the limited
CVS.
Currently,  it is being further  developed  with developer  communities  all over the world as a top-level  Apache
project. Subversion  is based on  the server-client  model. The server can run in a working  computer  or in
a separate  computer  connected  over the network.  In the case of centralized  version control systems  like
Subversion,  multiple  clients check-out  and use files from the central server.
C) Distributed  repository  (Git)
Distributed  version control systems  such as Git copy the entire repository,  instead of directly  downloading
the last snapshot  by the client. If a problem occurs at the server, the server can be restored using the copy
held by the client. In the case of a distributed  repository,  source codes can be saved in multiple  servers  or the
local PCs of multiple  developers,  rather than in just one central server. Therefore,  each server or PC becomes
a source code repository.  The source code saved in each repository  is not the same version, but the code is
stored in different  branches.  That is, branch versions  A, B, and C can be saved in the server A, whereas  branch
versions  A, C, and D can be saved in the server B. Therefore,  there is no concept  of a master version in the
system itself because  the branch versions  in each repository are all different  and the locations  for accessing
and retrieving  the source code are all different.
D) TFS (Team Foundation  Server)
Team Foundation  Server (TFS) is a Microsoft  product  that provides  various features,  such as source code
management  (Team Foundation  version control), reporting,  requirements  management,  project management
(agile software  development,  waterfall  model), automated  build, lab management,  testing, and release
management.  Although  TFS can be used as a backend  for numerous  integrated development  environments,  it
is designed  to offer the best benefits  when used as a backend  for Microsoft  Visual Studio or Eclipse (Windows
and non-Windows  platforms).  TFS is an integrated  repository  based on the SQL Server. TSF stores all
information  related to the software  development  activities  of the development  team - such as source codes,
deliverables,  development  activities,  etc. - to enable the team to collaborate  more effectively.

+ Preview  for practical  business Do we need to maintain  software?
Maintenance  costs account  for 60% of the entire software  process cost, of which 60% is spent on
functional  enhancement.  Of the remaining  40%, 17% is spent on error correction,  18% on maintaining
adaptability  to support  other platforms,  and 5% on refactoring.
Error correction  -
17%
Maintenance  - 60%
Software  maintenance  is the continuous  modification  and supplementation  of fully developed
software that is currently  in use, for the purpose  of adapting  it to changes  in the environment,
correcting  errors, and improving  its performance.  To reduce maintenance,  the system must be
properly  developed  so that it can flexibly  adapt to environmental  changes.
After its development,  software  will be continuously  modified  and supplemented  from the beginning
of its use until its final disuse for various  reasons.  Software  is a system that is directly  connected  to a
person's  consciousness  or behavior.
Therefore,  if the software  is not well maintained,  it will lose its vitality, that is, it will no longer be fit
for use. Therefore,  software  maintenance  is more important  than initial development,  and requires
more effort and cost.
