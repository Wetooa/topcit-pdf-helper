# Software Development & Architecture Trends Learning Guide

## I. Programming Language Updates & Trends

### A. Java 9
A significant update to the Java language.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Modularization:** Optimizes Java for small devices, improves scalability and performance.
    *   **Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation:** Compiles code *before* execution, reducing application startup time.
    *   **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):** Allows real-time feedback on code without full compilation.

### B. Kotlin
A functional programming language developed by JetBrains (creator of Android Studio). Adopted by Google as the official language for Android in 2017.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Optimal for Android development: Simple yet high-performance.
    *   Compatible with existing Android APIs; enables concise syntax.
    *   Similar to Java, making it easy for Java developers to learn.

### C. Swift
Developed by Apple for its platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS) to enable easier and faster application development.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Simple coding process, leading to excellent performance.
    *   Interactive and easy to understand.

## II. Technology Trends of Development Frameworks & Software Architecture

### A. Software Development Tools

#### 1. Angular4
A JavaScript framework developed by Google, primarily used for Single-Page Applications (SPAs).
*   **Single-Page Application (SPA):** A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content, offering a responsive user experience without full page reloads.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Built with TypeScript 2.1, suitable for small applications.
    *   Supports program logic and backend binding, making it more than a static web page framework.

#### 2. React
A JavaScript library created by Facebook for developing user interfaces, especially for large-scale applications with frequent page updates.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **JSX (JavaScript XML):** Allows writing markup code directly within JavaScript using an extended syntax.
    *   **Component-based:** Supports building UIs from independent, reusable view units called components.
    *   **Virtual DOM:** Enables efficient data processing by using a virtual representation of the UI.

#### 3. Express.js
A small, flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed to speed up web development.
*   **Node.js:** An event-based backend server development language that uses Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Processes dynamic HTML pages based on template parameters.
    *   Uses a **middleware structure** written in JavaScript, allowing developers to combine only necessary functions.

### B. Software Architecture

#### 1. Microservice Architecture
A design approach that breaks down a large application into several small, independent services. Each service has its own data repository and execution environment.
*   **Benefits:** Facilitates independent development, build, test, deployment, monitoring, routing, and scaling for each service. Allows prompt response to business changes, quick deployment, and easy modifications.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   High development productivity due to small, independent service units.
    *   Flexible deployment: Services can be deployed independently, not as a whole.
    *   Elaborate system expansion: Units can be expanded independently for precise scaling.

#### 2. Docker
An open-source platform that automates **Linux Container (LXC)** technology. It provides independent, isolated environments similar to virtual machines but much lighter.
*   **Linux Container (LXC):** A lightweight virtualization technology that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Simplifies packaging, distributing, and managing applications using containers.
    *   Uses **images:** Packages that include all files and settings needed for container execution.
    *   Enables simple and fast development configuration, independent of infrastructure requirements.
    *   Supports multiple cloud platforms.

ESSENCE
development.  The newly released  Java 9 includes  about 90 new features.
+ Key features  of Java 9
- Increased  modularization  enables  optimization  in small devices,  and the scalability  and performance  of Java
have been improved.
- The Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation  function,  which compiles  the code before execution  in a virtual
system,  reduces  the startup  time of the application  program.
- REPL (Real Eval Print Loop) is supported,  which enables  the reception  of feedback  on the program  before
compilation.
@ Kotlin
Kotlin is a functional  programming  language  developed  by JetBrain,  the creator  of Android Studio. It quickly
gained in popularity  after Google adopted  it as the official programming  language  for Android in 2017. Kotlin
provides  an optimal environment  for application  development  based on Android,  as it is simple yet offers
excellent  performance.
+ Key features  of Kotlin
- Compatible  with the existing  Android  APIs, and an app can be developed  using concise  syntax.
- Very similar  to Java, thus allowing  Java developers  to use Kotlin quickly  and easily.
@ Swift
Swift was developed  by Apple to support  application  development  for its products  such as iOS, macOS,
watchOS,  and tvOS. It was designed  to support  easier  and faster development  on its platform.
+ Key features  of Swift
- Easy to develop  an app owing to the simple coding process,  while providing  excellent  performance.
- Interactive  and easy to understand.
O2 Technology  Trends of the Development  Framework  and Software
Architecture
A) Technology  trends of software  development  tools
@ Angular4
Angular4  was developed  by Google,  and uses the JavaScript  framework  for maintenance.  Angular4  is used for
single-page  application  programs  and responds  to user requests  quickly by extending  the HTML DOM.
Angular  is a single page application  (SPA) framework,  which means that a view page can be retrieved  and
used dynamically  without  having  to change  the address  of the page when executing  the web page.
+ Key features  of Angular4
- Created  using TypeScript  2.1, which is helpful when making  a small application.

Software  Development )
- Supports  program  logic and the backend  binding  function,  and is not a simple static  web page.
@ Reacts
React is a JavaScript  library created  by Facebook  to develop  the Facebook  web. Like Backbone,js  and Angular,
React provides  a web front framework  needed for developing  an app. React is useful when building  a large-
scale application  that changes  web pages frequently.
+ Key features  of React
- Supports  the writing  of the markup  code in JavaScript  using extended  JavaScript  syntax,  which enables  the
existing  XML called JSX (JavaScript  XML).
- Supports  components  in individual  view units that constitute  the user interface.
- Allows  data processing  using the Virtual DOM.
@ Express,s
Express  is the web application  framework  of Nodejs,  which is small and flexible and provides  optimal  features
needed to develop  a web or application.  Express  supports  fast web development  for Node  js.
Node js is a back-end  server development  language  based on events, which uses the JavaScript  engine of
Google’s  Chrome  V8.
+ Key features  of Express
- Enables processing  of the dynamic  view of HTML pages depending  on the parameters  passed to the
template.
- Combines  necessary  functions  only by supporting  a middleware  structure  written  in JavaScript  code.
B) Technology  trends  of software  architecture
@ Microservice  architecture
The microservice  architecture  allows  independent  development,  build, test, deployment,  monitoring,  routing,
and extension  for each service, by dividing  one large application  into several small services  and creating  an
individual  data repository,  and by creating  an independent  execution  environment.
Prompt  response  to rapid business  changes,  deployment  within a short period of time, easy improvement  and
modification  are all possible.
+ Key features  of the microservice  architecture
- Development  productivity  is high as a service is divided into small units and developed  independently.
- Flexible  deployment  in units rather  than deployment  of the whole set.
- Asystem  can be expanded  elaborately  by expanding  the units independently.
@ Docker
Docker is an open-source  platform  that automates  the Linux container  (LXC) technology,  which provides
an independent  and isolated space like a virtual machine,  for ease of use. A company  called Dot Cloud
(now Docker) has started providing  technical  support  for the first time, while Google is preparing  Docker
configuration  for enterprises  by implementing  an open source project  called “Kubernetes”.
