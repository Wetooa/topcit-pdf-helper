## Software Development & UI/UX Design Learning Guide

### I. Design Patterns

#### 1. Observer Pattern

*   **Purpose:** Allows an object (Subject) to notify multiple other objects (Observers) when its state changes, without the Observers needing to know the Subject's specific class.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Subject:**
        *   Maintains a list of Observers (`observerCollection`).
        *   Methods: `registerObserver(observer)`, `unregisterObserver(observer)`, `notifyObservers()`.
        *   `notifyObservers()` iterates through the collection and calls `observer.notify()` on each.
    *   **Observer:**
        *   Defines an `update()` (or `notify()`) method that the Subject calls when its state changes.
    *   **Concrete Observers:** Specific implementations of the Observer interface (e.g., `Concrete Observer A`, `Concrete Observer B`).
*   **Java Example Overview:**
    *   `EventSource` (Subject): Extends `Observable` and implements `Runnable`. Reads input from `System.in`, calls `setChanged()` and `notifyObservers(response)` when new input arrives.
    *   `ResponseHandler` (Observer): Implements `Observer`. Its `update()` method receives the Subject (`Observable obj`) and the data (`Object arg`), then prints the received string.
    *   `MyApp` (Main Program):
        *   Creates an `EventSource` (subject) and a `ResponseHandler` (observer).
        *   Registers the `ResponseHandler` with the `EventSource` using `addObserver()`.
        *   Starts the `EventSource` in a new `Thread` to continuously read input and notify observers.

#### 2. State Pattern

*   **Definition:** Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class. This is achieved by defining different states as separate classes within an inheritance structure.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Removes complex conditional logic (e.g., `if-else` or `switch` statements) that checks state values.
    *   Facilitates adding new states easily without modifying existing code.
    *   Helps maintain information consistency.

#### 3. Strategy Pattern

*   **Definition:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Easy to select a desired algorithm at runtime.
    *   New algorithms can be applied without modifying existing client code.

#### 4. Template Method Pattern

*   **Definition:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
*   **Use Case:** When the basic frame of an algorithm is the same across different implementations (subclasses) but specific steps differ.

#### 5. Visitor Pattern

*   **Definition:** Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. This allows new operations to be added without modifying the existing object structure.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   New types of work (operations) can be added easily.
    *   Various tasks can be performed for multiple objects without inconvenience.

### II. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Design

#### 1. Core Concepts & Importance

*   **UI (User Interface):** The means by which a user interacts with a computer system, application, or device.
*   **UX (User Experience):** The overall experience of a person using a product, encompassing their attitudes, emotions, and perceptions about the system.
*   **Importance:** UI/UX is crucial for user satisfaction and is increasingly central to product planning and design.
*   **Key Areas to Understand:**
    *   Principles of user interface design.
    *   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
    *   Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   **Keywords:** UI/UX, HCI, GUI.

#### 2. Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

*   **Definition:** A field of study focusing on the design and use of computer technology, centered on the interfaces between people (users) and computers.

#### 3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

*   **Definition:** A type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, rather than text-based commands.

#### 4. Impact of Poor UX: Real-World Examples

*   **Medical Devices:** Poor UX design can have fatal consequences. User mistakes, often caused by complex or non-intuitive operational methods, can be more dangerous than physical device defects.
    *   **Example: Cardiac Defibrillator:** If pad attachment instructions are not intuitive, emergency measures fail.
*   **Therac-25 Accident (1970s):**
    *   **Device:** A radiation therapy machine.
    *   **Issue:** An upgrade aimed at improving usability by integrating physical settings and prescription processing led to a critical flaw.
    *   **Cause:** A poorly designed error message during the upgrade. The message was vague and easily misinterpreted by operators (e.g., similar error messages differentiated only by a hard-to-spot number).
    *   **Consequence:** A patient died from excessive radiation exposure because the device was abnormally interrupted multiple times, and the operator didn't understand the error. This highlights that user "insensitivity" or misunderstanding due to poor design can lead to disaster.

#### 5. Current Trends

*   Companies are increasingly focusing on UI/UX to:
    *   Maximize customer engagement, especially on limited-screen devices like smartphones.
    *   Increase sales in mobile business.
    *   Provide customer-oriented valuable services.
    *   Form expert UI/UX organizations.

+ State pattern
- Definition:  When a new state can be added to the internal state of a certain object continuously,  this
method facilitates  the addition of a new state. When the state of an object, including  the added state,
is changed,  the object state information  is defined and used as a class inheritance  structure  so that
performance  can be changed  without  modifying  the existing  source code.
- Advantages:  The sentence  that compares  state values inside the object is removed.  Helps maintain
information  consistency.

+ Strategy  pattern
- Definition:  Provides  a method  of selecting  the most suitable  character  by enabling  the algorithm  to change
character.
- Advantages:  Easy to select a desired algorithm;  and a new algorithm  can be applied without  modifying
existing  code.
+ Template  Method  pattern
- Definition:  If concrete  implementation  is different  when inheritance  is used, but the basic frame of the
algorithm  is the same within a larger scheme,  the same basic frame can be created  and managed  by the
superclass  as a module.
+ Visitor  pattern
- Definition:  Separates  work targets  and work items and defines  them in a class structure  so that new
types of work can be added easily, and various  tasks can be performed  for multiple  objects without  any
inconveniences.

* Preview  for practical business Even human life can be harmed  by a
poorly  designed  UX.
In the medical  device field, where software  directly  impacts  human life, people are more sensitive  than
in any other field since minor defects in a medical  device can have devastating  consequences  for a
patient,  even including  death. So which of the following  could have more catastrophic  consequences,
a faulty in a physical  device or a user’s mistake  during an operation?  Most people answer  the former:
however,  user mistakes  resulting  from complex  operational methods  and such like can pose a greater
risk. For example,  if the pad attachment  position  of a cardiac  defibrillator  is not intuitively  described,
emergency  measures  will not have any ...
