# Learning Guide: Reasoning, Hypothesis Testing, and Problem Solving

## 1. Logical Reasoning Fundamentals

**A. Deductive Reasoning**
*   **Definition:** Deriving a specific fact from general, known premises.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Direct Reasoning:** One fact from one premise.
    *   **Indirect Reasoning:** Concrete facts from two or more premises.
*   **Example (Indirect):**
    *   All men are mortal. (Premise 1)
    *   Socrates is a man. (Premise 2)
    *   Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)

**B. Inductive Reasoning**
*   **Definition:** Deriving a general principle from several concrete/empirical facts.
*   **Inventor:** Francis Bacon (1620).
*   **Process:** Make hypotheses from empirical facts, then judge truth with more empirical facts.
*   **Example:**
    *   Socrates is dead. (Concrete fact)
    *   Socrates is a man. (Concrete fact)
    *   Therefore, a man is mortal. (General principle)

**C. Limitations of Logical Explanation**
*   Both deductive and inductive reasoning provide logical explanations.
*   However, logical explanation alone is often **not enough to persuade stakeholders**. Additional methods are needed.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing for Persuasion & Verification

*   Used to explain or verify an established hypothesis, often with statistical methods.
*   Involves two mutually exclusive statements:

**A. Null Hypothesis (H0)**
*   **Definition:** An initial argument recognized based on existing knowledge or status quo.
*   **Example:** The average life expectancy of men in Korea is 70 years old.

**B. Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**
*   **Definition:** A new argument that you hope to prove as a new truth through testing. It contradicts the null hypothesis.
*   **Example:** The average life expectancy of men in Korea is **not** 70 years old (or has increased to over 70).

**C. Process Overview**
*   Hypotheses are adopted or rejected based on statistical hypothesis testing.
*   If H0 is rejected and H1 is adopted, it means the existing claim (H0) is found to be false, and the new claim (H1) is supported.

## 3. Business Problem Solving Techniques

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Identify business problem definitions and types.
*   Describe the business problem-solving process.
*   Apply appropriate problem-solving techniques.

**A. Concept of Business Problem Solving**
*   **Types of Business Problems:**
    1.  **Planning:** Creating new opportunities ("blue ocean"), finding solutions for new markets.
    2.  **Improvement:** Making internal processes more efficient for existing market opportunities.
*   **Importance:** Accurately recognizing, defining, and resolving these problems ensures stable business continuity and creates new opportunities.
*   **Key Attributes for Problem Solvers:**
    *   Broad and in-depth knowledge.
    *   Zero-base thinking (going beyond stereotypes).
    *   Ability to observe and analyze in detail.
    *   Openness to others' ideas.
    *   Efforts to find the best combination of ideas (wisdom).
    *   Ability to secure good information.

**B. Business Problem Solving Process (General Steps)**
*   A structured approach to recognize, analyze, address, and propose solutions for work-related problems.

**1. Step 1: Problem Definition**
*   **Goal:** Clearly decide what problem needs to be solved.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Grasp the essence of the problem.
    *   Determine if the problem can be fundamentally resolved.
    *   Use the **MECE framework** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to break down a large problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.

**2. Step 2: Cause Analysis**
*   **Goal:** Understand the root causes of the defined problem.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Classify and structure the problem logically.
    *   Use an **Issue Tree:** Dissect the main problem into smaller, logical components in a tree-like structure.
    *   Use profiling and various analysis methods to identify the *root cause*.
    *   Prioritize identified causes and remove non-essential ones.

**3. Step 3: Alternative Development & Evaluation**
*   **Goal:** Create and choose the best solutions for the identified root causes.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Develop various alternatives based on hypotheses and facts (from profiling).
    *   Evaluate alternatives using established criteria and weighting for each criterion.
    *   Select one or more optimal alternatives.

**4. Step 4: Solution Application & Feedback**
*   **Goal:** Implement the chosen solution and verify its effectiveness.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Find a suitable "test bed" for efficient verification.
    *   Execute the alternative based on a detailed work plan.
    *   Provide quantitative feedback on its effectiveness.
    *   Verify the solution's validity and incorporate feedback for improvement.

## 4. Creative Thinking Techniques

*   Methods to consciously guide thinking and derive innovative solutions.

**A. Brainstorming**
*   **Inventor:** Alex Osborn (1940s).
*   **Concept:** A meeting method to generate many ideas quickly, encouraging "a storm in the brain" of ideas.
*   **Usage:** Can be used throughout the problem-solving process (cause analysis, solution derivation, action planning).
*   **Key Principle:** Emphasizes free idea generation before evaluation.

**B. Six Thinking Hats**
*   **Inventor:** Edward de Bono.
*   **Concept:** A group method where participants adopt different "hat" roles to approach an issue from various perspectives, leading to optimal decision-making.
*   **Hat Roles:**
    *   **White Hat:** Objective facts, data, neutral information.
    *   **Red Hat:** Emotional thinking, feelings, intuition.
    *   **Black Hat:** Negative, critical thinking, risks, problems.
    *   **Yellow Hat:** Positive, optimistic thinking, benefits, opportunities.
    *   **Green Hat:** Creative thinking, new ideas, alternatives.
    *   **Blue Hat:** Process control, organizing results, objective overview.

**C. Random Word**
*   **Inventor:** Edward de Bono.
*   **Concept:** Presenting random words and combining them to create new connections and unique ideas.

**D. SCAMPER**
*   **Inventor:** Bob Eberle (based on Osborn's checklist).
*   **Concept:** An ideation method that uses a predefined checklist of prompts to generate ideas.
*   **Acronym:**
    *   **S**ubstitute
    *   **C**ombine
    *   **A**dapt
    *   **M**odify (or Magnify)
    *   **P**ut To Other Uses
    *   **E**liminate
    *   **R**earrange (or Reverse)

**E. TRIZ (Theory Of Inventive Problem Solving)**
*   **Inventor:** Dr. Altshuller (Russian inventor).
*   **Concept:** A problem-solving and ideation technique developed from analyzing thousands of existing inventions. It provides a systematic approach to innovation.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Model a **specific problem** into a **generalized issue** (abstraction).
    2.  Find a **general solution model** (using proven principles).
    3.  Derive a **specific solution** for the original problem.
*   **Key Principles:** Uses principles like 40 principles of invention and 76 standard solutions.
*   **ARIZ (Problem Solving Process):** A continuous, iterative process for solving complex invention-level problems.

Deductive  reasoning  is a method of deriving  a specific  fact from general premises  that are already known.
There is direct reasoning  that derives  one fact from one premise,  and indirect  reasoning  that derives  concrete
facts from two or more premises  (First premise,  Second premise).  The example  below is a representative  ex-
ample of deductive  indirect  reasoning.
All men are mortal. (First premise)
Socrates  is a man. (Second  premise)
Therefore,  Socrates  is mortal. (Conclusion)?
Inductive  reasoning  is a method  of reasoning  invented  by Francis Bacon in 1620. According  to Bacon, it refers
to a method  of making  guesses  or hypotheses  and principles  from empirical  facts and judging  truth/falsehood
with empirical  facts.* In other words, it is a method of deriving  a general principle  from several concrete  facts.
The example  below is a representative  example  of inductive  reasoning.
Socrates  is dead. (Concrete  fact)
Socrates  is a man.
Therefore,  a man is mortal. (General  principle)
Both deductive  and inductive  reasoning  are methods  of reasoning  for logical explanation,  but logical explana-
tion alone is not enough  to persuade  stakeholders.  In order to effectively  persuade  stakeholders,  there is more
to be needed  than logical explanation.
In some cases, it is necessary  to explain or verify an established  hypothesis  using a statistical  method,  and
the two mutually  exclusive  statements  used in this case are the null hypothesis  and the alternative  hypoth-
esis. The null hypothesis  is an initial argument  that is recognized  based on existing  knowledge, while the al-
ternative  hypothesis  is a new argument  that we hope to prove as a new truth through  testing. For example,
if there is an existing  claim that “the average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is 70 years old”, and there is a
claim that “the average  life expectancy  of men in Korea has recently  increased  to over 70 years”, we can con-
sider the following  null and alternative  hypotheses,
The Null Hypothesis:  The average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is 70 years old.
The Alternative  Hypothesis:  The average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is not 70 years old.
Based on the above two hypotheses, the  hypothesis  is adopted  or rejected  through  statistical  hypothesis
testing. In the example  above, if the null hypothesis  is rejected  and the alternative  hypothesis  is adopted,  the
average  life expectancy  is not 70 years old.

01 Business  Problem  Solving  Techniques
A) Concept  of business  problem  solving
In a business  environment,  problems  can be broadly  divided into two: planning  that creates  new opportunities:
and improvement  of internal processes.  Planning  can be said to be the process  of finding the “blue ocean’,
which is a business  opportunity,  and it is the process  of creating  a new market through a solution  that can
address  the current problems.  Improving  internal processes  is a task to more efficiently  execute  a current
market  opportunity.  When those two elements  are accurately  recognized,  defined and resolved,  it is possible
to ensure stable business  continuity  and to create new opportunities.  Therefore, it is most important  to solve
business  problems  through  optimal  problem-solving  processes ...
