## Learning Guide: Software-Based Networks (SDN & NFV)

This guide summarizes key concepts of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), two essential technologies transforming modern networks.

---

### 1. Introduction: Software-Based Networks

*   **Key Technologies:** Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are leading innovations in networking.
*   **Impact:** These technologies promote network openness and virtualization, aiming to reduce the dominance of large equipment manufacturers and encourage innovation from third-party software and equipment providers.
*   **Korea's Efforts:** Since 2012, Korea (led by ETRI) has invested in R&D and standardization for SDN and NFV to boost national competitiveness.

### 2. Why a Paradigm Shift? (Limitations of Traditional Networks)

Traditional network environments face several challenges:

*   **Changing Traffic Patterns:** Modern applications generate vast, dynamic traffic by accessing various servers and databases, shifting from simple client-server models to complex multi-system interactions.
*   **Increased Network Complexity:** Virtualization technology dramatically increased server numbers and complex network structures, making network design and management harder.
*   **Difficult Network Management:** Predicting dynamic traffic patterns is challenging, making traditional network design (e.g., link oversubscription) difficult to optimize.
*   **Vendor Dependence:** The core network often relies heavily on a few major equipment manufacturers, hindering the introduction of new services or technologies.

---

### 3. Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

SDN is a next-generation network technology that allows network control and management through software programming.

*   **Origin:** First proposed at the Open Network Summit in 2010. The Open Networking Foundation (ONF) was formed in 2011 to promote and standardize SDN and OpenFlow technology.
*   **Core Concept: Control Plane & Data Plane Separation**
    *   **Traditional:** Network devices integrate both control and data plane functions.
    *   **SDN:** Separates the **control plane** (decision-making, guiding where traffic goes) from the **data plane** (forwarding packets to a destination).
    *   **Mechanism:** An **SDN controller** manages the control plane, programming network behavior. Network devices (switches) handle the data plane, following commands from the controller using standard protocols like OpenFlow.
*   **SDN Architecture:**
    *   **Application Layer:** Network applications utilize SDN services.
    *   **Control Layer:** The SDN Controller centralizes network control.
    *   **Infrastructure Layer:** Network devices (switches, routers) forward data.
    *   **Interface:** The Control Data Plane Interface (e.g., OpenFlow) connects the Control Layer to the Infrastructure Layer.
*   **OpenFlow Technology:**
    *   Plays a key role as an interface standard for SDN operations.
    *   It allows the SDN controller to issue commands to network switches, directing how they process and forward packets.
*   **SDN Application:**
    *   Network devices become simpler, focusing only on packet forwarding (data plane).
    *   The centralized controller performs all complex routing and operational management tasks.
    *   **Example:** Routers can be simplified to perform only basic switching functions, with a central controller dictating their behavior.

### 4. Network Function Virtualization (NFV)

NFV virtualizes network functions, allowing them to run on general-purpose hardware instead of dedicated, specialized equipment.

*   **Background/Motivation:**
    *   Rapid growth in network speed and services led to increased demand for space and power for network equipment.
    *   Shortened equipment lifespans made it harder for service providers to profit.
    *   NFV addresses these issues by leveraging virtualization.
*   **Concept:**
    *   Runs network functions (e.g., firewalls, routers) as software on high-performance x86 servers.
    *   Creates Virtual Machines (VMs) or service profiles to activate necessary network functions on demand.
*   **NFV Architecture Framework:** Comprises three main function groups:
    1.  **VNFs (Virtual Network Functions):**
        *   Software implementations of network functions (e.g., virtual firewall, virtual router).
        *   Designed to support multiple applications.
    2.  **NFVI (NFV Infrastructure):**
        *   Provides the environment for VNFs to run.
        *   Includes physical hardware resources (computing, storage, network) and a virtualization layer to abstract these resources.
    3.  **NFV Management & Orchestration (MANO):**
        *   Manages and orchestrates all NFV components.
        *   Handles hardware/software resource management, VNF deployment, lifecycle management, and service delivery.
*   **NFV Application:**
    *   Instead of dedicated hardware appliances, network functions are implemented as software applications on common, high-performance x86 servers and switches.
    *   **Example:** A firewall, traditionally a specialized hardware box, can be deployed as a VNF on a standard server.

### 5. SDN & NFV: Complementary Technologies

While developed by different groups (SDN by researchers/data centers, NFV by ISPs), SDN and NFV are highly complementary and often deployed together.

*   **Individual Strengths:**
    *   **SDN:**
        *   Creates **network abstractions**, simplifying network management.
        *   Enables **faster innovation** and changes by allowing third parties to create innovative applications.
    *   **NFV:**
        *   **Reduces CAPEX** (capital expenditures) by using general-purpose hardware.
        *   **Reduces OPEX** (operating expenditures), space, and power consumption by consolidating functions onto fewer, virtualized platforms.
*   **Combined Benefits:** ISPs combine these technologies to leverage SDN's agile control over NFV's flexible, virtualized infrastructure.
*   **Relationship:** They can be configured independently but offer significant benefits when used together.

02 Software-Based  Network
The technologies  that have recently  received  the most attention  in the network  field are software-defined  networks
(SDN) and network  function  virtualization  (NFV). Network  openness  and virtualization  technologies  are expected  to
change  the era when certain large equipment  makers  dominated  the global network  equipment  market  and increase
3rd party software  providers  and equipment  makers  to enter the market.
Korea has planned smart Internet-related  R&D and standardization  projects  focusing  on SDN and NFV to enhance
national  SDN technology  competitiveness,  led by ETRI, since 2012. Organizations,  such as the TTA Future Internet
Project  Group (PG220) and the Smart Internet  Technology  Standardization  Council actively  promote  domestic
standards  and reflect  international  standards.
A) Limitations  of the existing  communication  environment  and paradigm  shift
@ Changes  in traffic patterns
Current  applications  generate  a large volume  of traffic, by accessing  various  application  servers  and databases  before
providing  users data. The environment  is changing  from the limited communication  between  the client and the server
to access  between  various  systems.
@ Virtualization  technology
Virtualization  technology  has dramatically  increased  the number  of servers  connected  to the network,  fundamentally
changing  the assumptions  about the host's physical  location.
@ Networks  getting  more complex
Network  structures  are becoming  more complex,  as a large number  of computers  are configured  of discrete protocol
sets,
@ Difficulties  in network  design and management
Initial designs use  a link oversubscription  method that considers  the expected  traffic patterns  and the number
of concurrent  users. However,  it is becoming  more difficult  to predict the network  size, as traffic patterns  change
dynamically.
© Increasing  dependence  on equipment  manufacturers
In particular,  the core network  has had difficulties  in introducing  new services  or technologies  as certain major
equipment  manufacturers  dominated  the communication  market.
B) SDN (Software  Defined  Network)
SDN is a next-generation  network  technology  that can set the network  routing and control and complex  operation
management  through software  programming.  The technology  attracted  attention  when ONF introduced  the
OpenFlow  technology,  and international  standardization  organizations,  such as IETF and ITU-T, began to develop
standards  for SDN-related  core technologies.  There is heated competition  in the industry  for securing  leadership  in

@ Introduction  of SDN
SDN was first proposed  at the Open Network  Summit,  a conference  specializing  in SDN and open flow, held at
Stanford  University  in October  2010. SDN and OpenFlow  are technologies  that program and configure  or operate
networks,  like computers.  They have attracted  attention  as new innovative  communication environmental
technologies.  In March 2011, ONF (Open Networking  Foundation)  was formed  to promote  and standardize  OpenFlow
and SDN.
@ Concept  of SDN
As shown in [Figure 150], SDN enables  programming  networks  by separating  the control plane (to guide the network
to which it goes) from the data plane (to send packets  to a specific destination).  The basis of SDN is a switch that
uses industry  standard  control protocols,  such as OpenFlow,  and can be programmed  through  an SDN controller.

As shown in [Figure 151], the OpenFlow  technology  separates  the functions  to control and transfer  the packets  and
controls  the network  through programming.  OpenFlow  consists  of a controller  and a switch. The controller issues
commands  to the switch, and the switch performs  tasks related to data flow, such as sending  or modifying  packets
to the destination,  according  to the commands.

@ SDN applications
As shown in [Figure 152], network  devices  have had a control plane and a data plane implemented  in one device until
now. However,  when SDN is applied,  the controller  performs  the control plane function  of each network  device, and
only the data plane function  remains  in the actual physical  network  device.
Here, OpenFlow  plays a role as an interface  standard  technology  ...
