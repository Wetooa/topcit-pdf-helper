### Section 2: Enterprises’ Response to Changes

Companies are innovating through disruptive strategies and leveraging collective intelligence.

#### 2.1 Disruptive Innovation

**Definition:** A strategy that destroys existing markets and creates new ones, often by dominating with technological innovation or price destruction, aiming to beat market leaders. It alters industry competition and consumer behavior.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Sustaining Innovation:**
    *   **Goal:** Continuously improve existing products for key customers.
    *   **Method:** Gradual improvements, high value at a high price.
    *   **Outcome:** Retains existing market share.
*   **Disruptive Innovation:**
    *   **Goal:** Create new markets or radically change existing ones.
    *   **Method:** Low-priced but good-quality products through simplified functions and enhanced convenience, often targeting overlooked segments.
    *   **Outcome:** Can instantly surpass existing technologies (e.g., smartphones replacing traditional mobile phones).
*   **Overshot Customers:** Customers who are unwilling to pay for high-end features they don't need or fully utilize. Disruptive innovation often targets these customers.

**Two Approaches to Disruptive Innovation:**

1.  **Low-End Disruption:**
    *   **Target:** Overserved customers in the low-end market.
    *   **Strategy:** Provide low-priced products that perfectly match customer satisfaction levels by resolving product complaints and leveraging a new, lower-cost business model (low margin, high resource utilization).
2.  **New Market Disruption:**
    *   **Target:** Non-customers (who reject existing products) or dissatisfied customers.
    *   **Strategy:** Launch innovative new products using new technologies, often simple and convenient, to build a presence in niche segments or create entirely new markets for previously unaffordable/inaccessible solutions.

**Example: Smartphones**
*   **Market Shift:** From voice-centered to data-serviced industry; from hardware-centered to platform-based.
*   **Market Obliteration:** Replaced MP3 players, digital cameras, game consoles, car navigation, tablet PCs.
*   **New Market Creation:** App stores, location-based services, SNS, social commerce, social games, Big Data, smart services.

**Latest Technologies Driving Disruptive Innovation:**

| Area        | Technology                  | Description                                                              | Predicted Change                                                                            |
| :---------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Electronics** | **Wearable Computer**       | Computer devices worn on the body or clothing.                           | High-tech textile industry growth, machine-dependent healthcare growth.                     |
|             | **3D Printing**             | Prints 3D shapes layer by layer.                                         | Personalized manufacturing, applications in nano/bio/aerospace.                             |
| **Telecom/Services** | **Situation Awareness Technology** | Automatically performs functions based on user's situation.                      | Refined target marketing, accelerated paradigm shift to predictive responses.                |
| **Automobile** | **Self-Driving Cars**       | Controls speed/steering by sensing position/situation without driver input. | Effective road infrastructure, reduced accidents (lower insurance/hospitalizations), rental service growth. |
| **Material** | **Ultra-Lightweight Material** | Strong, lightweight materials (e.g., micromaterials).                    | Expanded applications (aerospace to transportation), reduced energy consumption/prices.     |
| **Bio/Medicine** | **Genetic Therapy**         | Cures diseases by replacing faulty genes with normal ones.               | Changes in medical expense payment, preventive health insurance, growth of beauty/anti-aging industry. |
| **Energy**  | **Post Battery**            | Flexible, high-density, low-price batteries.                             | Popularization of wearable devices, IoT device industry growth, expanded electric vehicles/power storage. |

**Enterprise Strategy:** Enterprises planning disruptive innovations must clearly define their target technology and application area, and seek outside resources to dominate market opportunities.

#### 2.2 Crowdsourcing

**Definition:** A composite word combining 'crowd' and 'outsourcing.' It's the concept of opening various phases of an enterprise's operations to participation from consumers and the general public. Participants share in revenues if their contributions lead to improvements.

**Key Aspects:**
*   **Rise:** Gained traction with the development of SNS, allowing companies to tap into collective intelligence for ideas.
*   **Benefits for Enterprises:**
    *   Generates creative ideas.
    *   Solves enterprise issues (e.g., product development, problem-solving).
    *   Saves time and labor costs.
*   **Example: Dell Computers**
    *   Collected 10,000 ideas in 18 months via a consumer blog for business-related technologies.
*   **Business Model:**
    1.  **Problem Presentation:** Companies post problems/tasks online.
    2.  **Solution Generation:** The crowd (consumers, specialists, public) provides solutions.
    3.  **Compensation:** Successful solution providers receive compensation from the company.
*   **Ecosystem:** Crowdsourcing services often partner with professional technology brokerage firms to complete diverse projects, building a positive, self-reinforcing system.
*   **Synergy with IT:** Rapid advancements in Information Technology (IT) have made crowdsourcing a crucial element for business success by enabling direct public participation.

[Fig. 47] Transformation  of the business  environment
Many companies  that have entered the global market are now experiencing  difficulties  because  of the long global
economic  downturn  and low growth. As domestic  growth slows and direct overseas  investments increase,  the
costs that companies  have to bear are increasing,  while the corporate  business  environment  is becoming  ever more
complicated  due to the opening  of markets  and fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates. To overcome  this situation,
large companies  are implementing  a number  of different  strategies,  such as expanding  global sourcing  and entering
the service industry  in the case of manufacturing  companies.
@ Characteristics  of IT business  environment  transformation
To respond  to the ongoing  transformation  of the business  environment,  companies  are diversifying  their businesses
to gain a competitive  advantage  in the market  through  new business  models.  Among  the approaches  that companies
employ  to develop  new business  models are specialization,  modularization,  scaling up, internationalization,  and
networking.  The rapid development  of IT technology  and the advent  of the smart era are also driving  the latest shifts
in the business  paradigm.
Changes  in the internal and external  environments  surrounding  corporate  business  activities  are accelerating,
manifesting  themselves  in the form of endlessly  evolving  IT, changes  in consumption  patterns,  diversification  of
platforms,  and increasing  calls for innovation  from companies.
The gradual blurring and disappearance  of business  boundaries  (occasioned  by offline companies’  entry into the
online market,  the growth  of mobile businesses,  and the emergence  of convergent  businesses,  etc.)  which previously
guarded  different  areas of competition,  have diversified  business  channels  by, for instance,  paving  the way for the rise
of the online market.  Through  the online market,  enterprises  have gained the opportunity  to meet diverse  customers
and create new synergies.  In addition,  new business  concepts  have emerged  that reflect the latest consumption
trends, such as SNS-based  smart shopping  and the growth of one-person  Internet  companies  and crowd sourcing.
