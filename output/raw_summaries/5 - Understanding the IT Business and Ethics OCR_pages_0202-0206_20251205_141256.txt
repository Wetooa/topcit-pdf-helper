## IT Business and Ethics: Learning Guide

### I. Personal Information Protection

#### A. Obligated Persons for Information Protection
Certain entities are legally required to manage and protect personal information. You are an **obligated person** if you meet any of these criteria:

*   **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** Those providing information and communication network services in Seoul and all metropolitan cities.
*   **Integrated Information and Communications Facility Operators (IOCs):** As per Article 46 of the Telecommunications Business Act.

*   **High-Traffic Service Providers:** Those with more than 1 million daily users of information and communications services in the 3 months preceding the previous year.

**Voluntary Applicants:** Companies not meeting the criteria can voluntarily establish an information/personal information protection management system and apply for certification.

#### B. Personal Information Protection Management System (PIPMS)
The PIPMS objectively examines whether institutions and companies have a system to systematically and continuously perform personal information protection tasks, granting certification upon satisfaction of standards.

**PIPMS Structure (Key Components):**

1.  **Establishment & Operation of Management System:**
    *   1.1 Establishment of management system

    *   2.2 Personal security
    *   2.3 External security
    *   2.4 Physical security
    *   2.5 Certification and authority management
    *   2.6 Access control
    *   2.7 Encryption application
    *   2.8 Information system introduction and development security
    *   2.9 System and service operation management
    *   2.10 System and service security management
    *   2.11 Accident prevention and response
    *   2.12 Disaster Recovery
3.  **Requirements for Each Stage of Personal Information Processing:**
    *   3.1 Protection measures for collection of personal information
    *   3.2 Protection measures for possession and use of personal information
    *   3.3 Protection measures for provision of personal information
    *   3.4 Protection measures in case of destruction of personal information
    *   3.5 Protection of data subject rights

#### C. Handling Personal Information Leakage

**1. Immediate Response (Mandatory for >1,000 data subjects leaked):**
*   Notify affected data subjects immediately.
*   Initiate actions: confirm facts, block website, advise password changes.
*   Be prepared for dispute mediation or lawsuits from victims.

**2. Reporting Leakage to Authorities:**
*   **Who to report to:** Ministry of Security and Public Administration, Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA).
*   **When to report:** Within 5 days (after notifying data subjects and completing initial response).
*   **How to report:** Via email, fax, or website. Phone reporting is allowed in special circumstances, followed by a report submission.
*   **What to report:** Institution name, notification status, leaked items & scale, time & course of leakage, damage minimization measures & results, victim self-protection methods, remedy procedures, contact info for the department in charge.

**3. Examples of Past Breaches (Domestic Companies):**
*   **Mar 2017:** Accommodation reservation hacking, 3.24M cases, 970k victims. Sanctions: 310M won penalty, 25M won fine.
*   **Aug 2016:** Personal info provided to third-party insurance companies, 180k cases, 29k victims. Sanctions: 180M won penalty, 20M won fine.
*   **May 2016:** Hacking, 25.4M cases, 20.51M victims. Sanctions: 4.48B won penalty, 25M won fine.
*   **Sep 2015:** Hacking, 1.95M cases, 1.95M victims. Sanctions: 102M won penalty, 15M won fine.
*   **May 2015:** Unauthorized use of prepaid phones for foreigners, 870k cases, 780k victims. Sanctions: 360M won penalty.

#### D. Why Personal Information Protection is Essential

*   **Ubiquity of Personal Data:** Used in nearly all public and private IT services.
*   **Corporate Asset:** Personal information is a valuable asset for companies across various sectors (finance, healthcare, education, etc.).
*   **Crime & Fraud Prevention:** Prevents illegal trafficking, impersonation, and other criminal abuse.
*   **Mitigate Corporate Losses:** Reduces financial and reputational damage from leakage incidents and class-action lawsuits.
*   **National & Social Safety:** Contributes to overall national and social security.
*   **Global Trend & Growth Engine:** Aligns with international privacy standards and drives national development.
*   **Industry Importance:** A critical issue impacting all industries.
*   **Cross-border Exchange:** Essential for safe international data exchange due to FTAs.
*   **Public Trust & National Brand:** Impacts public administration credibility and national image.

### II. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

#### A. Introduction to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
IPR encompasses all property rights arising from intellectual activities. It includes:
*   **Industrial Property Rights:** For industrial development (e.g., patents, trademarks).
*   **Copyrights:** For cultural development (e.g., literary, artistic works).

IPR are crucial corporate assets, with increasing transactions and new forms emerging due to technological advancements. Understanding them is vital in the IT business.

#### B. Key Concepts & Learning Objectives
*   **Keywords:** Intellectual property rights, copyrights, author's rights, industrial property rights, new intellectual property rights, business works, software copyrights, prevention of unfair competition, trade secret protection, patent rights.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Explain copyrights and copyright infringement prevention.
    2.  Explain intellectual property rights and industrial property rights.

#### C. Trade Secret Protection

**1. Importance and Risks:**
*   Leakage of trade secrets allows competitors to easily replicate products, engage in dumping, leading to business crises and intensified competition.

**2. Definition of a Trade Secret:**
*   According to the "Act on the Prevention of Unfair Competition and Protection of Trade Secrets," a **trade secret** is information (e.g., production methods, sales methods, useful technical or business information for business activities) that:
    *   Is not publicly known.
    *   Is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.
    *   Has independent economic value.

**3. Causes of Leaks:**
*   Surveys show that the majority of trade secret leaks are caused by **internal staff**, often during **employee turnover**.

**4. Legal Penalties for Trade Secret Violation:**
*   **Criminal Penalties:**
    *   Up to 5 years imprisonment for domestic cases.
    *   Up to 10 years imprisonment for overseas cases.
    *   Fines are also imposed along with imprisonment.
*   **Attempted/Conspiracy:** Even attempting, intending, or conspiring to commit a crime related to trade secrets is punishable.

**5. The Human Factor in Protection:**
*   Even with reinforced security technologies, trade secrets are frequently leaked by people. Therefore, comprehensive measures addressing human factors are essential.
*   A key reason for inadequate protection systems is that executives and employees often lack exact knowledge of the "Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act."
