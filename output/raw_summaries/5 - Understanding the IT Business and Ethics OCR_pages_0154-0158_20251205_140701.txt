### 2. Micro Grid

**Definition:**
*   An extension of a smart grid, typically for a local area.
*   **US Department of Energy (DOE):** "A group of interconnected consumers and distributed energy resources (DERs) under clearly defined electrical specifications that can be controlled as a single entity, and that could be connected to the system or made independent."

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Local Power Grid:** Connects local electricity users with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) like wind and solar power.
*   **Self-Sufficiency:** Can operate independently of the main electric grid, allowing grid owners to be self-sufficient in power.
*   **Grid Connection:** Can still connect to the regular grid when needed.

**Examples (South Korea):** Jeju Island's smart grid complex, Gapado, Marado, Ulleungdo.

*   Addresses challenges related to climate change and water management.

**Reasons for Emergence:**
*   **Spread of Cloud Computing:** Enables automatic detection, cloud storage, and automated problem resolution for water systems.
*   **Intelligent Inspection Infrastructure:** Provides real-time water usage data via remote monitoring, improving fare calculation and reducing water usage.
*   **Impact of Climate Change:** Addresses agricultural water shortages, changes in river flow rates, and increased uncertainties/damage from drought/flood.

### 4. Smart Traffic (Intelligent Transportation Systems)

**Definition & Purpose:**
*   An intelligent transportation service that leverages information exchange.
*   **Goals:** Improve traffic safety, enhance traffic flow efficiency, and provide user convenience.
*   **Information Exchange:** Occurs between vehicles (V2V), vehicles and infrastructure (V2I), and vehicles and traffic control servers (V2N).

**Types of V2X Services (Vehicle-to-Everything):**

#### a. V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) Service
*   **Mechanism:** Vehicles wirelessly exchange information with surrounding vehicles.
*   **Information Exchanged:** Vehicle positions, traffic flow details, road conditions.
*   **Communication Technology:** Primarily Wireless Access in Vehicle Environments (WAVE).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Roadside information & obstacle notification.
    *   Road construction notification.
    *   Intersection traffic signal notification.
    *   Nearby vehicle information notification.
    *   Emergency vehicle proximity notification.

#### b. V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) Service
*   **Mechanism:** Vehicles communicate with traffic support infrastructure (e.g., roadside base stations).
*   **Vehicle Component:** On-Board Unit (OBU).
*   **Communication Technologies:** WAVE, 4G LTE/5G.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Vehicles with OBUs send/receive messages to/from roadside base stations.
    2.  Base stations connect to the traffic control center's backend server.
    3.  Center system collects, analyzes vehicle/base station data, then sends traffic/road condition info back to base stations.
    4.  Base stations relay this information to vehicles.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Real-time traffic information collection & provision.
    *   Electronic toll collection.
    *   Roadside information & obstacle notification.
    *   Road construction notification.
    *   Protected zone notification.

#### c. V2N (Vehicle-to-Network) Service
*   **Mechanism:** Vehicle communicates via a network with a server (in the cloud/Internet) or a mobile device.
*   **Vehicle Component:** Telecommunication Control Unit (TCU).
*   **Process:** TCU in vehicle communicates with a backend server, which then communicates with a mobile device.
*   **Purpose:** Provides information to the user and enables vehicle control.
*   **Communication Technologies (general network types):** Mobile communication, fixed-line connections, nearfield communication.

Technologies  that make up smart grids can be largely  grouped  under smart grid platforms  and smart  grid applications.
The platform  has intelligent  devices, bi-directional  communication  and sophisticated  control system for managing
distributed  and intelligent  power  grid. The platform  is configured  to operate  renewable  energy  applications,  intelligent
electric  vehicle charging  stations,  smart metering  applications,  power grid monitoring  applications,  demand  response
applications.  Intelligent  storage  devices have electronic  sensor and meters that monitor  the current state of the
smart  grid and has digital intelligent  devices  that can make basic decisions  on their own.
The IT infrastructure  attached  to the power  grid act as the IT elements  that are critical to the operation  of the smart
grid. It optimizes  energy efficiency  and gets people to consume  energy  through  bi-directional  exchange  of real time
information  (about the supply and demand  for electricity).  Therefore,  the smart grid must be equipped  with open
system networks  and protocols  so that its value-added  services  could create new products,  services,  and markets
and not limited to just providing  power. The communication  infrastructure  should provide end-to-end  services
between  intelligent  devices and maintain a reliable and steady supply of electric power. Furthermore,  development
must abide by standards  to support  interoperability  for various  interfaces.
© Micro Grid
Microgrid  is an extension  of a smart grid. The US Department  of Energy (DOE) defines a microgrid  as "a group of
interconnected  consumers  and distributed  energy  resources  (DERs) under a clearly  defined  electrical  specifications  that
can be controlled  by the system  as a single entity  and that could be connected  to the system  or made independent.”
An easy way to understand  micro grid is to view it as a power grid constructed  for a local area that connects
electricity  users with distributed  energy resources  such as wind and solar power. It is a power grid that can make a
grid owner become  self-sufficient  in power by operating  independently  of existing  electric  grid and still connect  to the
regular  grid when necessary.  In South Korea, microgrid  pilot testings  are underway  in Jeju Island's  smart  grid complex,
Gapado,  Marado,  and Ulleungdo.

@® Smart water grid
Due to climate changes  that affect the management  of water, there is growing  interest  in smart water grid, the
technology  for managing  water with ICT technology.  Smart water grid is a smart technology  that leverages  ICT
technology  for the management  of water, that essential  substance  for humanity  as well as the water supply and
sewage  water. ICT is used for informatizing  the entire process  of handling  water from the production  of drinkable
water, the transportation  of water, the processing  and reuse of water.
