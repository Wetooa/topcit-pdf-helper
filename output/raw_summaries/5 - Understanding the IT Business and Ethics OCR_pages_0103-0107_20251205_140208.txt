#### 1.2 The BI Dashboard

*   **Definition:** A data visualization tool that displays the status of key quantified metrics and performance metrics for an enterprise on a single screen.
*   **Purpose:** Helps decision-makers quickly identify areas needing attention (e.g., sales, costs, profits, risks) and make fast, intuitive judgments.
*   **Features:**
    *   Easy to customize screen configuration.
    *   Supports integration with tools like spreadsheets and real-time data analysis.
*   **Importance:** One of the most critical BI functions for facilitating quick, intuitive decision-making.

### 2. IT Service Management (ITSM)

#### 2.1 Overview of ITSM

*   **Definition:** A systematized method for managing IT services and ensuring their quality. Commonly referred to as ITSM.
*   **Core Concepts & Relationships:**
    *   **ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library):** The standard model or "best practice" framework that ITSM uses for guidance.
    *   **IT Outsourcing:** ITSM functions can be outsourced to external service providers.
    *   **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A formal agreement signed between a service provider and a customer, defining the specific level of IT service to be delivered. It serves as the standard for measuring service quality.
    *   **SLM (Service Level Management):** The systematic process of managing IT services to ensure they meet the agreed-upon standards defined in the SLA.
    *   **CSR (Customer Service Request):** The process customers use to request an IT service.
*   **Leading Standards Associated with ITSM (Rooted in ITIL):**
    *   **eSCM (eSourcing Capability Model):** An international quality assessment model used by service providers to objectively evaluate their quality and capabilities in delivering IT services. It guides IT service implementation across all business phases.
    *   **ISO/IEC 20000:** An international standard that specifies the requirements for IT service management activities. It was developed from the BS15000 certification.

### 3. IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)

#### 3.1 Definition of ITIL

*   **What it is:** A comprehensive framework of "best practices" for IT service management. It compiles proven approaches to guide organizations in delivering efficient and effective IT services.
*   **Origin:** Developed by the Central Computer & Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) of the UK in the late 1980s for public agency users.
*   **Purpose:** To provide standard guidelines for managing IT services, helping organizations clearly understand their IT service framework and achieve business objectives.
*   **Status:** An intellectual property and registered trademark managed by the British government, widely recognized as a de-facto global standard for IT service management.

#### 3.2 History of ITIL

*   **Version 1 (1980s):** Developed to address the British government's reliance on IT, published as a collection of specialized IT service documents.
*   **Version 2 (2000-2001):** Introduced with a focus on two main areas: Service Delivery and Service Support.
*   **Version 3 (2007/2011):** Announced in 2007 (known as ITIL 2007 edition) and improved in 2011. It introduced a "lifecycle approach" and a stronger focus on business value.

#### 3.3 ITIL v2 Process Areas (Key Elements)

ITIL v2 primarily focused on two core areas:

*   **1. Service Delivery:** Focuses on the strategic and tactical aspects of planning and providing IT services.
    *   **Service Level Management:** Manages and ensures service quality as dictated by SLAs.
    *   **Capacity Management:** Estimates required resources and manages transaction loads.
    *   **Availability Management:** Ensures the continuity and control of IT services.
    *   **Financial Management:** Manages the quantitative costs and income associated with IT services.
    *   **IT Service Continuity Management:** Manages efforts for disaster recovery and service resilience.
*   **2. Service Support:** Focuses on the day-to-day operational support of IT services.
    *   **Service Desk:** The single point of contact for users to report incidents, problems, and inquiries.
    *   **Incident Management:** Manages and evaluates the impact and resolution of service malfunctions.
    *   **Problem Management:** Investigates the root causes of incidents and applies emergency measures to solve them.
    *   **Change Management:** Manages and controls changes to IT services, programs, and infrastructure.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Manages information about IT assets and their configurations.
    *   **Release Management:** Manages the planning, building, testing, and deployment of approved products and services.
*   **Other Mentioned Areas:** Business Perspective (e.g., business continuity, outsourcing), and ICT Infrastructure Management (e.g., network, operations, system management).

#### 3.4 ITIL v3 Process (Lifecycle Approach)

ITIL v3 evolved from v2 by:
*   Becoming a **business value model**.
*   Supporting **IT governance** (a previous deficiency).
*   Extending IT service management to **all business areas**.
*   Strengthening service support and delivery, and incorporating requirements from ISO/IEC 20000.
*   **Goal:** To align IT with business strategies through a lifecycle perspective and continuously improve IT services.

ITIL v3 consists of **five process areas** that form a continuous, repeated lifecycle for service improvement:

*   **1. Service Strategy:**
    *   **Purpose:** To define the strategic perspective of IT service management, ensuring IT services are aligned with business objectives.
    *   **Key Activities:** IT service strategy planning, organization and relationship specification, IT investment management, understanding customers, prioritizing competition and investment, HR management, compliance with external requirements.
*   **2. Service Design:**
    *   **Purpose:** To design new or changed IT services to meet business requirements and strategic objectives.
    *   **Key Activities:** Negotiation and contract drafting based on requirement analysis, designing service solutions (applications, systems, processes), evaluating alternative solutions, and procuring preferred solutions.
*   **3. Service Transition:**
    *   **Purpose:** To build, test, and deploy new or changed services into the live operational environment.
    *   **Key Activities:** Release planning and preparation, building/testing/piloting services, establishing and preparing a transition plan, managing the transition/adoption/disposal of services, service verification and testing, transition review and termination.
*   **4. Service Operation:**
    *   **Purpose:** To deliver and support IT services efficiently and effectively in the live environment, ensuring services meet customer expectations.
    *   **Key Activities:** Customer request processing and communication management, event/incident/problem management, service level metrics management, monitoring efficiency (e.g., safety, accessibility management).
*   **5. Continual Service Improvement (CSI):**
    *   **Purpose:** To continuously improve the effectiveness and efficiency of IT services and processes across all lifecycle stages.
    *   **Key Activities:** Participating across strategy/design/implementation phases, analyzing service reports and identifying trends, establishing performance evaluation baselines, implementing the **PDCA Model** (Plan-Do-Check-Action cycle), operating service improvement programs, and providing feedback to earlier lifecycle phases.
    *   **Note:** ITIL v3 strengthened the performance evaluation (ROI) area significantly compared to v2.

The BI dashboard  is one of the most important  elements  of the BI functions  because  it permits users to make
intuitive  judgments.
This is a data visualization  tool that displays  in one glance the status of key quantified  metrics  and performance
metrics  for an enterprise.  Through  dashboards,  metrics such as sales, costs, profits, and risk levels in various areas
are presented  on a single screen so as to help decision  makers make quick decisions  by making  it easier for them to
identify  the areas they should pay close attention  to.
In general,  the screen configuration  of dashboards  is easy to customize  as it supports  easy customization  and easy
integration  with tools such as spreadsheets  and real-time  data analysis.

+ ITSM uses ITIL (IT infrastructure  library), which is the standard  model (best practice)  of the IT service.  Depending  on
the form of trade between  companies,  ITSM could be outsourced.
+ AnIT service  can only be realized  when a service  level agreement  (SLA) has been signed.
+ The signed SLA becomes  the standard  for measuring  the quality of the IT service, and systematic  management  of
the IT service  can be pursued  using SLM.

ITSM uses the ITIL (IT infrastructure  library),  which is the standard  model (best practice)  of the IT service. Depending
on the form of trade between  companies,  ITSM could be outsourced.
In addition,  an IT service can be only realized  when  a service level agreement  (SLA) has been signed. The signed
SLA becomes  the standard  and the baseline  for measuring  the quality of the IT service.  Therefore,  it is important  to
establish  and manage  these standards.
Once the level of a service  has been decided  between  the user and service supplier,  the IT service  is delivered  at that
level. User requests  for IT services  will be handled  by the CSR (Customer  Service  Request)  process,
Some of the leading standards  associated  with IT service management  include eSCM and ISO/IEC 20000. These
standards  are all rooted in ITIL.
* The eSCM (eSourcing  Capability  Model) is an international  quality assessment  model used by service providers  to
objectively  evaluate  quality and capabilities  in order to provide IT services  to customers.  It provides  guidance  on
implementing  IT services  at all phases  of the business.
