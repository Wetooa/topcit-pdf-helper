# Software Design & Architecture Learning Guide

## 1. Program Structure Design from Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) can guide the creation of program structures. Two main approaches are:

### 1.1 Transform Flow-Oriented Design

This method applies when a DFD shows a clear progression from input to processing to output.

*   **Core Idea:** Identify the **Input Flow**, **Transform Center**, and **Output Flow** in the DFD.
*   **Program Structure Components:**
    1.  **Input Control Module:**
        *   Receives data from lower levels.
        *   Refines input data (if needed).
        *   Sends refined data to upper levels.
    2.  **Transform Control Module:**
        *   Processes the core transformation logic.
        *   The number of these modules depends on transform complexity.
    3.  **Output Control Module:**
        *   Receives processed data from upper levels.
        *   Refines output data (if needed).
        *   Sends data to lower levels.
*   **Visual Representation:** Imagine data entering (input), being processed (transform), and then exiting (output) in a linear fashion.

### 1.2 Transaction Flow-Oriented Design

This method is used when an input can trigger one of several distinct actions or output paths.

*   **Transaction:** An event (data, control signal) that initiates an action.
*   **Core Idea:** Identify the **Transaction Center** in the DFD.
*   **Transaction Center (T bubble):**
    *   Receives input.
    *   Evaluates the input to decide which "action path" to take.
    *   Has one input path but multiple, mutually exclusive output paths.
    *   Each output path can itself contain transform or transaction flows.
*   **Program Structure Components:**
    1.  **Transaction Center Module:** Handles the evaluation and dispatching logic.
    2.  **Input Reception Module:** Receives the initial transaction.
    3.  **Operation Path Modules:** One or more modules corresponding to each distinct action or output path.
*   **Visual Representation:** Data enters, goes to a central point (transaction center), and then branches out to one of several possible processing paths.

## 2. Software Architecture (SA)

Software Architecture has become critical for developing high-quality software effectively and adapting to technological changes.

### 2.1 Overview of Software Architecture

*   **Definition:** A "blueprint" or "set of important decision-making rules" about the software's structure. It describes:
    *   System composition and how components interact.
    *   Modules, processes, data, and their structures.
    *   Relationships between components.
    *   Methods for extending and modifying components.
    *   Technology used, flexibility, and performance.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Manages system complexity.
    *   Serves as a communication tool among stakeholders.
    *   Aids in decision-making for overall system structure and project organization.
*   **Key Components (IEEE-1471 Standard):**
    *   **System Architecture:** The overall structure.
    *   **Environment:** The context in which the system operates.
    *   **Stakeholder:** Anyone interested in the system (e.g., users, developers).
    *   **Rationale:** The reasons behind architectural decisions.
    *   **Description:** The documentation of the architecture.
    *   **Viewpoint:** A perspective on the architecture (e.g., security, performance).
    *   **View:** The representation of the architecture from a specific viewpoint.
    *   **Model:** A formal representation within a view.
    *   **Concern:** An interest in the system.
    *   **Library:** Reusable architectural elements.

### 2.2 Software Architecture Design Procedure

A structured approach to creating software architecture:

1.  **Requirements Analysis:**
    *   Identify specific requirements (functional and non-functional) through proposals, interviews, and meetings.
    *   Classify and specify these requirements.
2.  **Architecture Analysis & Design:**
    *   Identify and prioritize key quality factors (e.g., performance, security, maintainability).
    *   Identify potential architectural styles (e.g., client-server, microservices) and candidate architectures.
    *   Design the chosen architecture based on these factors.
3.  **Architecture Verification & Approval:**
    *   Evaluate the selected architecture against requirements and quality attributes.
    *   Detail the architecture for implementation.

### 2.3 Roles of a Software Architect

A software architect plays multiple crucial roles throughout a project:

1.  **Creator of a Vision:**
    *   Understands requirements and constraints.
    *   Leverages professional experience to define the software's framework.
    *   Requires creativity and the ability to present a clear design.
2.  **Key Technical Consultant:**
    *   Advises development teams on technical matters using their expertise.
    *   Crucial for selecting appropriate design patterns and development frameworks to ensure quality.
    *   Requires continuous learning and competency development.
3.  **Decision Maker:**
    *   Leads the design team.
    *   Makes critical decisions affecting the overall design, especially in agile environments.
    *   Requires strong domain knowledge.
4.  **Coach:**
    *   Trains teams on the defined architecture.
    *   Manages improvements and feedback.
    *   Acts as a technical leader, guiding and sponsoring technical growth.
5.  **Coordinator:**
    *   Mediates and coordinates diverse opinions among project participants to maintain design integrity.
    *   Requires strong technical and communication skills to prevent risks.
6.  **Implementer:**
    *   Evaluates new technologies for design impact and implementation feasibility (often using prototypes).
    *   Architects often grow from developers by enhancing their skills and experience.
7.  **Advocate:**
    *   Continuously evaluates new architectures.
    *   Builds a case for introducing new technologies and securing ongoing investment.
    *   Drives continuous advancement in technical skills and architecture.

[Figure 13] Input and output  boundary  of the data flow diagram
Now, it’s time to start creating  a program  structure  centered  on the data flow. The guidelines  needed  to create
a transform-based  program  structure  are based on identifying  the input flow, transform  center, and output  flow
of the data flow diagram.  Mapping  the structure  table in the data flow diagram  is performed  by the guidelines.
Three components  can be found if the root program structure is created in the transform  flow-oriented  data
flow diagram.  The three components  are as follows.
+ Input control module,  which processes  input.
+ Transform  control module,  which processes  transform.
+ Output  control module,  which processes  output.
The input control module receives  input data from the lower-level  modules  and sends them to the upper-level
module.  If necessary,  the input data are refined and transmitted  to the upper level. The output control module
receives  output  data from the upper level and sends them to the lower-level  modules.  If necessary,  this module
also refines  the output  flow and transmits  it to the lower-level  module.
The number  of control modules  is subject to system complexity,  and the number  of control modules  that
process  transform  is determined  by transform  centered  complexity.  The figure below shows a simple program
structure  based on transform.

B) Transaction  flow-oriented  design
A “transaction”  is said to occur when data, control signal, etc. trigger an action. Transaction  flow-oriented
design can be used when received  input can be split into multiple  output flows. A transaction  evaluates  the
input value and flows the result along one of several output paths depending  on the result. The center  of the
information  flow in this case is called the transaction  center. The figure below shows this characteristic,  and
the bubble  T is the transaction  center.

[Figure 15] Transaction  flow
If the data flow diagram  has a transaction  flow, the location  of the transaction  center should be clarified  first.
The transaction  center receives  a transaction  as an input and connects  it to several  output bubbles.  Therefore,
the transaction  center  has one input path and multiple  output  paths. Each operation  path (output  path) can be
composed  of several bubbles  and can have  a transform  flow or a transaction  flow.
Based on this, a program  structure based on transactions  can be created. Such a structure consists  of three
components.
+ Amodule  that acts as a transaction  center.
+ A module  that receives  an input.
* One or more modules  corresponding  to each operation  path.
The figure below shows the structure  of the program  structure  based on transactions.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
Recently,  software  architecture  has been highlighted  as having a fundamental  and useful key role in
effectively  reflecting  changes  in information  technology  and developing  high-quality  software  most
effectively  in a timely manner.  Architecture  design is the process  of identifying  the composition  of a
system  and how its components  interact  with each other at the beginning  of the design process.  This
phase is required  to manage  the complexity  of the system.
