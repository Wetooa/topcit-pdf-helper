### **2. Project Organizational Structures & Roles**

Organizational structures dictate how projects are managed and how authority is distributed.

#### **A) Project Organizational Structures**

1.  **Functional Organization:**
    *   **Structure:** Traditional, divided by task/function (e.g., HR, Marketing, Engineering).
    *   **Project Execution:** Projects are conducted independently within functional groups.
    *   **Project Manager Role:** No separate PM; functional manager takes responsibility. If a PM exists, they act as a **facilitator** with minimal to no decision-making authority.
    *   **Authority Level:** Minimum to none.
    *   **Time Horizon:** Part-time.

2.  **Projectized Organization:**
    *   **Structure:** Project-focused. Teams often share physical space.
    *   **Project Manager Role:** PM has **total authority** and decision-making responsibility for the project.
    *   **Authority Level:** Total authority.
    *   **Time Horizon:** Full-time.
    *   **Role:** Manager.

3.  **Matrix Organization:**
    *   A hybrid combining elements of functional and projectized structures.
    *   **Weak Matrix:**
        *   **Similar to:** Functional organization.
        *   **PM Role:** Facilitator, with close to no authority.
        *   **Time Horizon:** Part-time.
    *   **Balanced Matrix:**
        *   **PM Role:** Coordinator. Functional members may act as PMs. Has partial decision-making authority.
        *   **Authority Level:** Minimum to medium.
        *   **Time Horizon:** Full-time.
    *   **Strong Matrix:**
        *   **Similar to:** Projectized organization.
        *   **PM Role:** Dedicated PM with significant decision-making responsibility and authority, focusing on project management.
        *   **Authority Level:** Medium to strong.
        *   **Time Horizon:** Full-time.
        *   **Role:** Manager.

#### **B) Responsibilities & Roles of a Project Manager (PM)**

The PM is responsible for the entire scope and schedule of a project, overseeing progress, communicating updates, and resolving issues/risks from start to finish.

**PM Competencies:**

1.  **Project Management Knowledge Competency:**
    *   Knowledge of project management processes, tools, templates.
    *   Ability to track project progress.
    *   Understanding of scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communication, risk, procurement, integration, change, and contract management.
    *   Problem-solving skills.
    *   Experience in job and project management.

2.  **Technical Competency:**
    *   Understanding of practical work and processes related to the project.
    *   Comprehensive knowledge of information technology, industry trends, and products/systems.

3.  **Communication Competency:**
    *   Negotiating skills (with stakeholders, approvers, senior authority).
    *   Leadership skills to effectively lead the team and communicate with team members, stakeholders, and customers.
    *   Effective human resource management.

---

### **3. Project Management Office (PMO)**

The PMO is an organizational entity dedicated to improving project management performance.

*   **Purpose:** To enable effective, enterprise-wide project management.
*   **Role:** Oversees projects, mediates issues, provides consulting, and complements the client's expertise.
*   **Necessity:** Especially important for complex, intangible projects (e.g., informatization projects) that require high credibility, thorough planning, quantitative process management, regular communication, and quality assurance.

#### **PMO Classification:**

PMO can be classified by Type, Role & Responsibility (R&R), Time Horizon, and Skill.

**A) Classification by PMO Type:**
*   **Internal:** Composed of internal project managers.
*   **External:** Composed of external project managers.
*   **Combined:** A mix of internal and external project managers.

**B) Classification by PMO Role & Responsibility (R&R) Models:**
These models define the level of influence and responsibility the PMO has.

1.  **Weather Station Model:**
    *   Operated by a small number of professionals.
    *   **Role:** Acts as a **facilitator**. Primarily secures and provides progress information, distributes project management knowledge, and develops/disseminates methodology.

2.  **Coach Model:**
    *   An extended concept of the Weather Station model.
    *   **Role:** Provides guidance on processes. Distributes common methodologies/tools, fosters communication within project teams, monitors project performance, and supplies PM experts.

3.  **Control Tower Model:**
    *   **Role:** High influence and responsibility. Deeply involved in all projects and decision-making. Applies consistent methodologies, centralizes management, and coordinates/determines resources for projects.
