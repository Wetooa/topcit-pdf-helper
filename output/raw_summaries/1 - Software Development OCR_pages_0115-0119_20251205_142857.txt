## Software Requirements Specification & Management

This guide covers essential principles, contents, and management of software requirements.

### A. Requirements Specification Principles

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) defines principles for high-quality software requirements specifications. These ensure the specification is useful and manageable:

*   **Verifiability:** Requirements can be checked to ensure they are met.
*   **Modifiability:** Requirements can be easily changed when needed.
*   **Clarity:** Requirements are presented clearly to all stakeholders.
*   **Accuracy:** Requirements are described precisely and correctly.
*   **Traceability:** The origin and rationale of each requirement can be tracked.
*   **Consistency:** There are no conflicts between requirements.
*   **Completeness:** All important details (functionality, performance, constraints) are documented.
*   **Interpretability:** Requirements have a consistent meaning for everyone.
*   **Understandability:** Requirements are easy for stakeholders to comprehend.

### B. Main Contents of a Requirements Specification (IEEE Standard)

A typical requirements specification is structured as follows:

1.  **Overview**
    *   Overall software description.
    *   Purpose and intended audience of the specification document.
    *   Relationship to software goals, constraints, business strategy.

2.  **Overall Description**
    *   **Project Perspective:** Software's relationship to its purpose, constraints, and benefits.
    *   **Product Functions:** List of major functions (detailed later).
    *   **User Characteristics:** Description of user experience, education, disposition, and frequency of use.
    *   **Software Operating Environment:** Hardware, OS, and software environment requirements.
    *   **Constraints:** Hardware, memory, technology use, multilingual support, security, design/programming conventions.
    *   **Assumptions/Dependencies:** Assumptions affecting the software (e.g., outsourced components).
    *   **User Scenario:** Describes the system from a user's viewpoint.

3.  **Interface**
    *   **User Interface:** How users interact with the software (screens, commands).
    *   **Hardware Interface:** Protocols and interaction between system hardware components and software.
    *   **Software Interface:** Data/messages accessed by this software from other software components.
    *   **Communications Interface:** How the software communicates externally.

4.  **Functional Requirements**
    *   Detailed requirements for each function listed in the "Product Functions" section.
    *   For each function:
        *   **Purpose:** Reason for the function.
        *   **Inputs:** Data entering the function (with validation checks).
        *   **Outputs:** Data exiting the function (with error messages, parameter ranges, formats).

5.  **Non-Functional Requirements**
    *   **Performance Requirements:** Speed, response time, resource usage.
    *   **Security Requirements:** Access control, data protection.
    *   **Software Quality Requirements:** Availability, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, usability, etc.

6.  **Other Requirements**
    *   Operation rules, business standards, legal compliance.

### C. Requirements Change and Tracking Management

Once requirements are finalized and a project begins, changes are inevitable.

1.  **Requirements Change Management**
    *   The process of formally controlling all changes to the established requirements baseline.
    *   Ensures consistency and integrity of changes throughout the project.

2.  **Reasons for Requirements Changes/Errors**
    *   Initial requirements errors, conflicts, or inconsistencies.
    *   Participants gain a deeper understanding of the system over time.
    *   Changes in the system environment or organization.
    *   New technical, time, or cost problems arise.

3.  **Requirements Traceability**
    *   **Definition:** The ability to track a requirement through its lifecycle, from origin to implementation and testing.
    *   **Granularity:** Not just tracing entire documents, but tracing *each sentence* or individual requirement within documents.
    *   **Example:** Tracking how a marketing requirement leads to a system requirement, then a subsystem requirement, and finally influences a specific design decision.

4.  **Benefits of Requirements Traceability**
    *   **Reduces Rework:** Prevents omission of higher-level requirements in downstream deliverables.
    *   **Improves Quality:** Enhances clarity, traceability, and testability of individual requirements.
    *   **Impact Analysis:** Allows analysis of the impact of proposed changes.
    *   **Collaboration:** Enables effective teamwork between different teams/companies.
    *   **Test Coverage:** Ensures all requirements are covered by test cases, improving product quality.
    *   **Consistency:** Maintains consistency across all project deliverables.
    *   **Productivity:** Reduces miscommunication and errors caused by changes.

### D. Software Configuration Management (SCM)

SCM is increasingly recognized as crucial for software quality.

1.  **Importance & Trends**
    *   Critical for quality in software development, especially for large, distributed projects.
    *   Often involves using CASE tools (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) for management.

2.  **Learning Objectives**
    *   Understand the concepts and activities of SCM.
    *   Learn to use SCM tools (e.g., version management tools).

3.  **Key Concepts/Keywords**
    *   **Software Configuration:** The specific set of components that make up a software system at a particular point in time.
    *   **Software Configuration Management Elements:** Components of SCM (e.g., source code, documents, build scripts).
    *   **Change Control Procedure:** Formal process for managing modifications to configuration items.
    *   **Version Management Tool:** Software to track and manage changes to files over time (e.g., Git, SVN).
    *   **Configuration Management Tool:** Software to manage complete configurations of a system (combines version control with build, deployment, etc.).

4.  **Why SCM is Essential: Lessons from a Failed Project Scenario**
    *   **Lack of Centralized Management:** Distributed storage of source code and documents leads to loss (e.g., virus infection, individual PC failure).
    *   **No Version Control:** Difficulty identifying the latest working version, leading to lost work and wasted time.
    *   **Poor Documentation:** Absence of proper documents makes onboarding new team members difficult and slows down projects.
    *   **Reliance on Individual Developers:** Key project knowledge residing solely with individuals creates single points of failure.
    *   **Inefficient Change Handling:** Modifying source code directly on demand without a formal process leads to inconsistencies and errors.
    *   **Impact on Trust & Deadlines:** All these issues lead to project delays, rework, increased costs, and loss of customer trust.

**In summary, SCM provides systematic control over software assets, ensuring integrity, traceability, and efficient collaboration, preventing the chaos and failures seen in the example project.**

03 Requirements  Change  and Tracking  Management
A) Overview  of requirements  traceability
Once the requirements  baseline is established  and the project starts, changes  to the requirements  will
inevitably  occur. Requirements  change management  is the process  of formally  controlling  all changes  that
occur based on the requirements  baseline.  The consistency  and integrity  of changes  can be provided  by
controlling  and tracking  formal changes  to the requirements  that arise in the course of executing  the project.
Errors occur while changing  the requirements  for the following  reasons:
+ Requirements  errors, conflicts,  and inconsistencies  occur.
+ The participants  develop  a deeper  understanding  and greater  knowledge  of the system
+ Changes  occur in the system  environment  and organization.
+ Technical,  time, and cost problems  arise.
The above types of errors can be reduced by defining  and configuring  the traceability  of the requirements.
