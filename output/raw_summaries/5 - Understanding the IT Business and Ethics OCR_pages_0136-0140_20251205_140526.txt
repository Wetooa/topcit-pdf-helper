## 01. Latest Web and Mobile Services

### A) Latest Web Technologies

#### 1. HTML5

*   **What it is:** The next-generation standard for HTML.
*   **Key Advantage: No Plugins Needed**
    *   Eliminates the need to install separate programs or browser plugins (like ActiveX) for services (e.g., KakaoTalk, word processors, games can run directly in a web browser).
    *   Overcomes limitations of previous HTML by supporting rich web applications (video, voice, 2D graphics) natively.
*   **Design Principles:** Compatibility, practicality, interoperability, universal access.
*   **Improved Semantics:** Adds 26 new markups for clearer meaning representation than HTML4.
*   **API Support:** Introduces new API functions (e.g., web form, canvas, web socket) for web-based application development.
*   **Efficiency:** Uses less JavaScript code than HTML4 for similar functions, making it better for mobile environments.
*   **Business Adoption:** Increasingly used for corporate solutions to maximize scalability and efficiency.

#### 2. Responsive Web / Adaptive Web

*   **The Problem:** Users want consistent web content quality across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) despite different screen sizes and specifications.
*   **Responsive Web:**
    *   **Approach:** A web design method where the website's layout and style automatically adjust to fit *any* device screen size, providing an optimal user experience.
    *   **Focus:** Often emphasizes adapting content from a "mobile-first" perspective.
*   **Adaptive Web:**
    *   **Approach:** A server-based or client-based technology that *detects* the accessing device.
    *   **How it works:** Delivers content (e.g., images) specifically *tailored* for that device, ensuring high-speed access, especially on mobile.

#### 3. Semantic Web

*   **What it is:** A "smart" web that enables intelligent data processing and knowledge building.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Defines and structures data using **ontology** (a formal representation of knowledge).
    *   Links structured data, allowing computers to understand the *meaning* (semantics) and relationships between web resources.
*   **Why it's Needed:** Traditional HTML only displays documents; computers cannot understand the semantic meaning or efficiently process vast, unstructured web information.
*   **Application Areas:**
    *   **e-commerce:** Connecting to frameworks like ebXML.
    *   **Data Mining:** Web mining across the entire web (e.g., e-CRM, e-MarketPlace).
    *   **Knowledge Processing:** Collecting and distributing large volumes of knowledge.
    *   **Web Service:** Linking with enterprise business service components.

#### 4. SNS (Social Network Service)

*   **Definition:** Online services that help people maintain existing personal relationships or establish new ones.
*   **History:** Evolved from early online communities (e.g., "The Well" in 1985).
*   **Main Functions:**
    *   **Relationship Forming:** Allows users to define and manage their connections.
    *   **Profile:** Register personal information (hometown, interests, occupation).
    *   **Communication:** Provides tools like chatting, messages, email, video chat.
    *   **Content Production:** Tools for creating and sharing photos, videos, and text.
    *   **Network Utilization:** Allows users to recommend or distribute profiles and content.
*   **Scale:** Global platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp have billions of monthly users (as of 2017).

#### 5. Open API (Open Application Programming Interface)

*   **Definition:** A free, publicly available API that users and developers can use without restriction.
*   **Impact:** Empowers users to move beyond just *consuming* services to *developing their own* new services using existing APIs.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Provides access to specific functions of a website or service.
    *   Enables creation of new services by combining multiple APIs.
    *   Key to the development of **mashup sites**.
    *   Transforms users into potential service providers.
*   **Component Elements:**
    *   **Services Provided:** Weather data, traffic info, public information, maps, etc.
    *   **Technologies Used:** XML, SOAP (server-side), JavaScript, AJAX (client-side).

#### 6. REST (Representational State Transfer) API

*   **Prevalence:** Currently the most widely used type of Open API.
*   **Architecture:** A network-based architecture designed by Roy Fielding (an HTTP author) to leverage the strengths of the Web (HTTP).
*   **Components:** Based on Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA), composed of:
    *   **HTTP URI:** Specifies the target resource (e.g., a specific piece of data).
    *   **HTTP Method:** Designates the action to be performed on that resource.
*   **Common REST API Methods:**
    *   **POST:** Creates a new resource.
    *   **GET:** Retrieves (searches and extracts) information about a resource.
    *   **PUT:** Corrects or updates an existing resource.
    *   **DELETE:** Removes a resource.

### B) Mobile Services

#### 1. Location Based Service (LBS)

*   **Growth:** Rapidly expanded since 2010 due to the surge in smartphone use ("mobile Big Bang").
*   **Evolution:** Merged location information with commerce and entertainment to become a broad category of services.
*   **Enabling Factors:**
    *   Increased availability of devices capable of location detection.
    *   Opening of location determination platforms.
*   **How it Works (Smartphones):** Combines various location detection technologies:
    *   **Base Stations (Cell-ID):** Uses cellular tower signals.
    *   **GPS:** Global Positioning System.
    *   **Wi-Fi:** Uses Wi-Fi network signals.
    *   **Motion Sensors:** Provides precision navigation.
*   **Integration:** Adoption of mapping services like Google Maps and Apple Maps made LBS widely accessible and usable for general purposes.

**Mashup Site:** A website that combines APIs (e.g., product information, maps) from different sources (like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo) with its own user interface to create new, integrated services.

+ Preview  for practical  business AlphaGo,  the Al that beat one thousand
years of human learning
The match pitting Lee Sedol (a Go player with the 9 ‘dan’ rank) against  AlphaGo's  Deep Mind Challenge,
held from March 9 to 15, 2016, was a shocking  event that showed how artificial intelligence  could far
surpass  human learning  ability. The fact that AlphaGo  defeated  Lee Sedol, the world's  No. 1 player  for more
than a decade and also one of the strongest  players in the world of Go since 2014, was a clear  sign that
artificial  intelligence  can overcome  human learning  skills that have evolved  over many thousands  of years.

01 Latest  Web and Mobile  Service
A) Latest  web technologies
@HTML5
Typically,  a separate  program must be installed  when a person wants to use a particular  service or program on a
smartphone  or PC. Kakao Talk is a leading messenger  program  that is widely used in South Korea and exists in
different  versions  for PC, Android  and iOS. As such, a separate  program  must be installed  for each type of OS in order
to use Kakao Talk. However,  if HTMLS is used, there is no need to install a separate  program,  and Kakao Talk can be
accessed  directly  through  the web browser.  Furthermore,  word processors  and games can be used without  having to
install with the help of HTML5.
The HTMLS standard  is a next-generation  HTML standard  that overcomes  the limitations  of previous  HTML
standards,  allowing  rich web applications  such as video, voice, and 2D graphics,  without  requiring  a separate  plug-in.
Plug-ins  and Active X control were very popular  as solutions  for overcoming  the limitations  of the previous  HTML:
However,  each came with its own set of problems,  which could only be overcome  through  functional  expansion  and
combination  through  the advanced  CSS3 and JavaScript  APIs.
HTML5  was designed  around the principles  of compatibility,  practicality,  interoperability,  and universal  access. The
contents  of the HTML standard  cover the document  structure,  markup standards,  and API standards.  When the
semantic  markup  part and the API part of the HTML5  standard  are examined  separately,  26 new markups  have been
added to the semantic  markup part to enable much clearer semantic  representation than conventional  HTML4.
HTMLS5 allows various services  or applications  based on web content,  such as search engines,  to provide improved
functionality,  In the case of APIs, new functions  such as web form, canvas,  and web socket  were added to support  the
development  of web-based  applications.  HTML5 uses much less JavaScript  code than HTML4  to support  the same
functionality,  making it easier to use in mobile environments  where network  speed is a sensitive  factor. Recently,  a
growing  number  of cases have arisen in which corporate  business  solutions  are transitioning  to an HTML5-based
environment  so as to maximize  scalability  and efficiency.
@ Responsive  web/Adaptive  web
With the growing  use of mobile devices such as tablet PCs and smartphones,  interest in the mobile web is also
increasing.  Users want to enjoy the same web contents  at the same level of quality, irrespective  of the type of mobile
device or PC being used. However,  it was not easy to provide  the same quality of service  for different  environments
resulting  from different  mobile phone specifications  and the restrictions  that come with different  mobile phone screen
sizes. It is also impossible  to develop  a web that is optimized  for all types of mobile devices. The responsive  web
emerged  as one approach  to solving  this conundrum.
The responsive  web is an approach  to web design that results in the most optimal user environment,  i.e. one that
meets the requirements  of many different  devices - from desktops  through monitors  to mobile phones. In other
words, it is a web whose size changes  to fit any device environment,  making  it easy for users to read the contents.
With the recent trend towards  carrying  mobile devices as the primary  or first device, the number  of mobile web
users has grown to exceed the number  of regular  Internet  web users. Web designers  have responded  by minimizing

unnecessary  elements  of regular  web pages for the sake of improving  the screen size, network  speed and quality, and
the user mode of the mobile devices  (the common  limitations  of the mobile environment); that is, they have begun
to focus more on the functions  that should be provided  on the mobile web. While responsive  webs typically  focus
on how changes  in layout and style take place from one device to another,  there also exist responsive...
