## Learning Guide: Network Concepts and Protocols

### I. Error Control & IEEE 802 Standards

#### 1. Error Control
*   **Concept:** Mechanisms to ensure data is transmitted accurately and reliably across networks.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Error Detection:** Identifying if errors occurred during transmission (e.g., using checksums, parity bits).
    *   **Error Correction:** Fixing errors that occurred, often by retransmitting corrupt data or using error-correcting codes.

#### 2. IEEE 802 Standard
*   **Concept:** A family of IEEE standards for Local Area Networks (LANs) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), covering various network technologies.
*   **Key Standards:**
    *   **IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet):** Defines wired LANs using CSMA/CD.
    *   **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi):** Defines Wireless LANs (WLANs).

### II. Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)

#### 1. Network Layer Overview & Equipment
*   **What it is:** The layer responsible for logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) and routing data packets between different networks.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Logical Addressing:** Assigning unique IP addresses to devices.
    *   **Routing:** Determining the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination across multiple networks.
    *   **Fragmentation:** Breaking large packets into smaller ones if necessary.
*   **Internetworking Equipment:** Devices that operate at the network layer to connect networks.
    *   **Router:** A device that connects different networks and forwards data packets based on their IP addresses to reach their destination. It makes routing decisions.
    *   **Switch:** (Primarily Layer 2, but can have Layer 3 capabilities for VLAN routing). Connects devices within a single network segment (LAN) and forwards data frames based on MAC addresses.
    *   **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN):** A logical subdivision of a physical network, allowing devices on different physical switches or ports to behave as if they are on the same local network. This enhances security and network management.

#### 2. Network Layer Encapsulation
*   **Encapsulation:** The process where the Network Layer adds its own header (e.g., an IP header) to the data received from the Transport Layer, forming a **packet**.
*   **IPv4 Header:** Contains crucial information like source IP address, destination IP address, time-to-live (TTL), protocol type, and checksum, used for routing.

#### 3. Packet Switching
*   **Packet Switching:** A network communication method where data is broken down into small units called **packets**. Each packet can travel independently over different network paths and may arrive out of order, to be reassembled at the destination. This is efficient for shared network resources.

#### 4. Network Service Quality (QoS)
*   **Quality of Service (QoS):** A set of technologies for managing network resources to reduce latency, packet loss, and jitter, ensuring a specific level of performance for critical applications (e.g., voice, video).
*   **Implementation Techniques:** Prioritization (giving certain traffic precedence), bandwidth reservation, traffic shaping, congestion avoidance.

#### 5. Routing Protocols & Algorithms
*   **Routing Protocol:** A set of rules that routers use to exchange information about network reachability and update their routing tables.
*   **Routing Algorithm:** The logical process or calculation used by routers to determine the optimal path for data packets to reach a destination.
*   **Routing Protocol Types:**
    *   **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs):** Used within an Autonomous System (AS) (e.g., OSPF, RIP, EIGRP).
    *   **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs):** Used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems (e.g., BGP).

#### 6. IPv4 Overview
*   **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) Address:** A 32-bit numerical label assigned to devices on a network, used for identifying and locating devices for routing data. Expressed in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   **Purpose:** Uniquely identifies a device on a TCP/IP network.

#### 7. IPv4 Address Designation System & Subnetting
*   **IPv4 Expression:** Typically in **dotted decimal notation** (four numbers separated by dots, each 0-255).
*   **IPv4 Address System (Historical):** Traditionally classified into classes (A, B, C) based on the first octet, determining network and host portions.
*   **Special IPv4 Addresses:**
    *   **Private IP Addresses:** Used within private networks, not routable on the public internet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
    *   **Loopback Address:** 127.0.0.1, used for testing local network interfaces.
    *   **Broadcast Address:** Sends data to all devices on a subnet.
*   **Subnetting:** The process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). This conserves IP addresses, reduces broadcast traffic, and improves security.
*   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** A method that replaces the traditional classful addressing system. It uses a **prefix length** (e.g., /24) to define the network portion of an IP address, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of IP addresses.
*   **Supernetting:** The opposite of subnetting; combining multiple smaller networks into a larger network (a "supernet") using a shorter network prefix. This is used to reduce the number of routing table entries.
*   **IPv4 Address Allocation:** Managed globally by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) and regionally by RIRs (Regional Internet Registries).

#### 8. IPv6 Overview
*   **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) Address:** A 128-bit numerical label used for identifying and locating devices on a network. Expressed in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
*   **Background:** Developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide improvements in routing and security.

#### 9. IPv6 Addressing System & Header Structure
*   **IPv6 Addressing System:** Uses 128 bits, providing a vast address space. Addresses are written in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
*   **IPv6 Header Structure:** Simplified compared to IPv4, with fewer fixed fields. It uses **extension headers** for optional functions like fragmentation, security, and mobility, making it more flexible and efficient.

### III. Transport Layer Protocol (OSI Layer 4)

#### 1. Concept of Transport Layer Protocol
*   **Role:** Provides end-to-end communication between applications on different hosts. It handles data segmentation, multiplexing, demultiplexing, and (for some protocols) reliability, flow control, and congestion control.

#### 2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Connection-Oriented:** Establishes a connection (using a three-way handshake) before data transfer and tears it down afterward.
    *   **Reliable:** Guarantees delivery of data, retransmitting lost or corrupted segments. Uses acknowledgments (ACKs) and sequence numbers.
    *   **Ordered Delivery:** Ensures data segments are delivered in the correct order.
    *   **Flow Control:** Prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
    *   **Congestion Control:** Manages network traffic to avoid overloading the network.
*   **Operation Scenario:** Involves a **three-way handshake** (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a connection, data transfer with acknowledgments, and a four-way handshake to gracefully terminate the connection.

#### 3. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Connectionless:** Does not establish a connection before sending data.
    *   **Unreliable:** No guarantee of delivery, order, or duplication prevention.
    *   **Fast & Low Overhead:** Ideal for applications where speed is more critical than guaranteed delivery (e.g., streaming, DNS queries).
    *   No built-in flow control or congestion control.

#### 4. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Message-Oriented:** Preserves message boundaries (like UDP).
    *   **Reliable:** Guarantees data delivery (like TCP).
    *   **Multi-homing:** A single connection can use multiple IP addresses on different network interfaces, providing redundancy.
    *   **Multi-streaming:** Allows data to be divided into independent streams, preventing head-of-line blocking.
    *   Used in applications like IP telephony signaling.

### IV. Application Layer Technologies (OSI Layer 7)

#### 1. What is Application Layer Protocol?
*   **Role:** Provides network services directly to end-user applications. It defines how applications interact with the network and exchange data.

#### 2. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
*   **Purpose:** The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Used for fetching resources like HTML documents.

    *   **H.323:** An older ITU-T standard for multimedia communication over packet-switched networks.
    *   **VoLTE (Voice over LTE):** High-definition voice calls and video calls carried over a 4G LTE network.

#### 3. Media Transport Protocols
*   **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** Carries real-time data such as audio and video over IP networks. Provides sequence numbering and timestamps but does not guarantee delivery.
*   **RTCP (RTP Control Protocol):** Works in conjunction with RTP to monitor data delivery, provide quality feedback, and synchronize streams.
*   **RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol):** Controls the delivery of multimedia content from a media server, acting like a "remote control" for streaming.
*   **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem):** An architectural framework for delivering multimedia services (voice, video, messaging) over IP networks, independent of the underlying access technology.

*   **Paradigm Shift:** Moving towards programmable, flexible, and automated networks.
*   **SDN (Software Defined Network):**
    *   **Concept:** Separates the network's **control plane** (logic for routing decisions) from the **data plane** (hardware for forwarding packets).
    *   **Functionality:** A central **controller** manages network devices, allowing network behavior to be programmed and configured through software, enabling greater agility and automation.
*   **NFV (Network Function Virtualization):**
    *   **Concept:** Decouples network functions (e.g., firewalls, routers, load balancers) from proprietary hardware and runs them as software applications on standard servers.
    *   **Functionality:** Replaces dedicated hardware appliances with virtualized instances, reducing costs, increasing flexibility, and speeding up service deployment.
*   **SDN and NFV Synergy:**
    *   **Combined Benefits:** NFV virtualizes network services, while SDN provides the programmable infrastructure to manage and orchestrate these virtualized functions. Together, they create highly agile, scalable, and efficient network infrastructures.
