## 2. Understanding Projects: Core Concepts

### A. Importance of Project Understanding

    *   Manage enterprise-wide projects and portfolios.
    *   Prioritize projects and programs that align with organizational strategy.
    *   Supply and manage necessary resources.

## 3. Project Management Standards & Knowledge Systems

*   Project management techniques cannot be applied uniformly due to project uniqueness and varying environments.
*   It's essential to know existing standards, guidance, knowledge, skills, and tools, and when to apply them.

**Key Systems & Standards:**
*   **PMP (Project Management Professional):**
    *   Professional qualification by PMI (Project Management Institute).
    *   Based on **PMBOK** (Project Management Body of Knowledge).
    *   Consists of 5 process groups, 49 processes, and 10 knowledge areas.

    *   Comprises 11 important cases, 5 process groups, 10 subject groups, and 39 processes.

## 4. What is a Project?

### A. Definition
*   A **project** is a sum of efforts to mobilize resources to achieve a specific goal.
*   It is any activity where limited human and physical resources are invested over a **set (temporary) time** to create a **unique product or service**, or for a **specific purpose**.

### B. Key Features of a Project
*   **Temporary:** Has a specific beginning and end.
*   **Uniqueness:** Every project delivers a unique product or service.
*   **Progressive Elaboration:** The product/service details are specified gradually, from a general idea to specific requirements.
*   **Constraints:** Most common constraints are scope, cost, and time (often called the "triple constraint").
*   **Resource and Quality:** Aims to provide quality to customers and stakeholders through allocated resources.

## 5. Project Management Hierarchy: Project, Program, Portfolio

These terms represent different levels of management within an organization.

### A. Definitions
*   **Project:** An individual effort with a specific goal, temporary nature, and unique outcome (as defined above).
*   **Program:**
    *   A group of **interrelated projects** managed together.
    *   Aims to achieve a **common, larger goal** by integrating multiple projects and managing them effectively.
*   **Portfolio:**
    *   A collection of **programs and projects** undertaken to achieve an organization's **strategic goals**.
    *   **Portfolio Management:** Strategic, involving prioritizing programs/projects and providing appropriate resources.

## 7. Project Organizational Structures

Organizational structures for project execution are typically categorized into functional, matrix, and project-oriented.

### A. Functional Organization
*   **Description:** A traditional corporate structure where the organization is divided into groups based on specific tasks or functions (e.g., Marketing, Engineering, HR).
*   **Project Execution:** Projects within a functional group are conducted independently from other groups.
*   **Project Manager Role:**
    *   There is often no separate project manager; the manager of each functional group performs project responsibilities.
    *   If a project manager exists, they typically have limited authority within this structure.

Vil. Understanding  of Project
>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
It is important  to understand  the concept  and characteristics  of project, organizational  structure
for project execution,  and the areas of activities  of project managers  and participants,  for the
successful  execution  of a project, given that all business  activities  including  software  development
are operational  and project-based.
2. To be able to describe  the organizational  structure  and roles of participants  for project  execution.
Corporate  projects  are increasingly  operated  through PMO organizations  or similar organizations
that manage  enterprise-wide  projects  and portfolios.  Projects  are activities  to achieve  organizational
requirements,  and PMOs prioritize  projects  and programs  that become  the organization's  strategy,
and supply and manage  necessary  resources.

+ Preview  for practical business
As all projects  are original without being uniquely  the same, and the environment  in which they
are conducted  is all different,  project management  techniques  cannot be applied in a uniform
manner. Still, it is necessary  to know what standards  and guidance  exist in the project knowledge,
skills, techniques,  and tools, and which situation  they are applicable,  in order to make the project
successful.  Representative  knowledge  systems  and standards  of projects  are as follows:
PMP is a professional  qualification  for project management  supervised  by the PMI (Project
Management  Institute).  It has a project management  knowledge  system called PMBOK, consisting
of 5 process groups, 49 processes  and 10 knowledge  areas. PRINCE2  is a project management
method based on project management  qualifications  and procedures  created in the UK. ISO 21500
was developed  by the International  Organization  for Standardization  (ISO) in 2012, from the existing
private project management  into a global project management  standard  system, consisting  of 11
important  cases of project  management,  5 process  groups, 10 subject  groups,  and 39 processes.
01 Concept  of Project
A) Definition  of project
According  to The Mythical Man-Month  by Frederick  Brooks, the Tower of Babel was man’s first project and
Noah's Ark. was the first successful  one. As such, a project  refers to a sum of efforts to mobilize  resources  to
achieve  a specific  goal. Recently,  projects  are being carried out for the purpose  of developing  various  products
or services  by investing  limited resources  within a predefined  period, both inside and outside  the company.
As such, a project  refers to any activity  in which limited human and physical  resources  and efforts  are put into
place at a set (temporary)  time to create a unique product  or service, or for a specific  purpose.

Similar  terms to the project include program  and portfolio.  A program  is a set of interrelated  projects.  It aims
to integrate  multiple  projects  into a single program  in order to achieve  a common  goal in consideration  of cor-
relations  between  projects,  and to manage  individual  projects  in an effective  manner.
A portfolio is a set of programs  and projects  undertaken  to achieve an organization's  strategic  goals. Portfolio
management  is carried out from the strategic  perspective  of the organization,  including  prioritizing  programs
and projects  and providing  appropriate  resources,
