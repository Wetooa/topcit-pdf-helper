# Information Security: Authentication & Hash Functions

## 1. Hash Functions and Their Applications

A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (e.g., a message or password) into a fixed-size string of characters, called a **hash value** or **message digest**.

### 1.1 Key Characteristics of Hash Functions
*   **One-way:** It's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and get the original input from the hash value.
*   **Collision-resistant:** It's very difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

### 1.2 Applications of Hash Functions

1.  **Checking File Integrity (Detecting Alteration)**
    *   **Sender:**
        1.  Calculates a hash value for the original message.
        2.  Sends the message along with its hash value.
    *   **Receiver:**
        1.  Receives the message.
        2.  Calculates a new hash value for the *received* message.
        3.  Compares this new hash value with the hash value sent by the sender.
        4.  **Result:** If they match, the message has not been altered during transmission. If they don't, integrity is compromised.

2.  **Password-Based Encryption (PBE)**
    *   Combines a user's password with a `salt` (a random number) and feeds them into a hash function.
    *   The resulting hash value is used as an encryption key.
    *   **Benefit:** Protects against password attacks by not storing or using the raw password directly as a key.

3.  **Electronic Signatures (Digital Signatures)**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides both data integrity and proof of the signer's identity.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  A hash value is calculated for the document.
        2.  The signer's private key is used to "sign" this hash value (not the entire document).
    *   **Efficiency:** Signing the small hash value is much faster than signing a large document.
    *   **Validity:** This signature is considered valid for the original document because finding another document with the same hash value is extremely difficult.

### 1.3 Hash Functions vs. Encryption
*   **Hash Function:** One-way process. You cannot get the original data back from the hash value. (e.g., used for password storage).
*   **Encryption:** Two-way process. You can encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and then decrypt it back to plaintext using a key.

## 2. Authentication Technology

**Authentication** is the process of verifying two things:
1.  That information exchanged between parties has not been altered or deleted.
2.  That the individuals (sender/receiver) involved are legitimate.

### 2.1 Types of Authentication

1.  **User Authentication:**
    *   **Purpose:** Verifies a user's identity to another party (e.g., a server) to prevent impersonation.
    *   **Application:** Used for logging into systems and granting access to services. Remote users require strict authentication due to the privileges they gain upon verification.

2.  **Message Authentication:**
    *   **Purpose:** Confirms that the contents of a transmitted message are original and have not been tampered with.
    *   **Tool:** Electronic signatures can achieve both message authentication and sender identification.

### 2.2 Methods of Authentication

Authentication methods are generally categorized by *what* is used to prove identity:

1.  **Knowledge-based ("What you know"):**
    *   Examples: PINs, passwords, account numbers.

2.  **Ownership-based ("What you have"):**
    *   Examples: OTP (One-Time Password) tokens, smart cards, card keys.

3.  **Presence-based ("What you are" - Biometrics):**
    *   Examples: Iris recognition, fingerprint recognition, voice recognition, face recognition.

## 3. Specific Authentication Technologies

### 3.1 Password Authentication

*   **Overview:** The most common authentication method. Users set a password, then provide it to be compared with the stored version for verification.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Easy to guess:** Using common words, social engineering.
    *   **Easy to leak:** Storing/transferring passwords in plaintext.
    *   **Easy to hijack:** Malicious software (e.g., Trojan horses) or direct access to password files.
*   **Password Policy (Best Practices):**
    *   Minimum 8 characters.
    *   Combine uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   Easy for the user to remember, difficult for an attacker to guess.
    *   Store passwords using a **hash function** (never plaintext or reversible encryption).
    *   Limit failed login attempts.
*   **Attack Techniques:**
    *   **Brute-force attacks:** Trying every possible combination.
    *   **Dictionary attacks:** Trying words from a dictionary.
    *   **Trojan horses:** Malware that steals credentials.
    *   **Direct access:** Gaining unauthorized access to password files.
    *   **Social engineering:** Tricking users into revealing passwords.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Use password generators.
    *   Enforce login failure limits.
    *   Require periodic password changes.
    *   Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect attacks.
    *   Security awareness training for users.
    *   Implement OTPs.

### 3.2 One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication

*   **Concept:** Generates a unique password for each login session. This password is valid only once.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces the risk of password reuse attacks and replay attacks (where stolen credentials are used later).
*   **Types of OTPs:**

    | Type             | Sub-type            | Description                                                                                             |
    | :--------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Synchronous**  | Challenge-response  | Server sends a random number (challenge); client uses it to generate the OTP.                           |
    |                  | Time-synchronous    | Both server and client use the current time as an input to generate a synchronized OTP. (See process below) |
    | **Asynchronous** | Event-synchronous   | Both server and client use a shared authentication count (e.g., number of logins) to generate the OTP.  |

*   **Time-Synchronous OTP Operating Procedure:**
    1.  Authentication server and client synchronize their internal clocks.
    2.  User requests login.
    3.  Client (e.g., an OTP token) generates an OTP based on the current time.
    4.  User inputs the generated OTP.
    5.  Server also generates an expected OTP using its synchronized time.
    6.  Server compares the user's input OTP with its generated OTP. If they match, authentication is successful.

### 3.3 Biometric Authentication

*   **Concept:** Uses automated sensors to measure and analyze a person's unique physical or behavioral features for authentication.
*   **Characteristics (Ideal Biometric Features):**
    *   **Universality:** Everyone has the characteristic.
    *   **Distinctiveness:** Unique to each individual.
    *   **Acquisition:** Easily measurable by a sensor.
    *   **Permanence:** Stable and doesn't change significantly over a person's lifetime.
    *   **Accuracy:** Provides precise and consistent authentication.
    *   **Acceptability:** Non-intrusive and user-friendly during acquisition.
*   **Types of Biometric Authentication:**

    | Category              | Type        | Description                                                                 |
    | :-------------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Body Information**  | Fingerprint | Most common. Uses semiconductor, optical, or mixed sensors.                 |
    |                       | Iris        | Highly accurate and fast but often requires expensive systems.              |
    |                       | Face        | Natural method, uses facial features for recognition.                       |
    |                       | Vein        | Identifies patterns in the shape of veins.                                  |
    |                       | DNA         | The most accurate method.                                                   |
    | **Behavioral Characteristics** | Signature   | Analyzes both the final signature form and the hand's movement trajectory.  |
    |                       | Voice       | Used in various applications, including physical access control.            |

*   **Process of Biometric Authentication:**
    1.  **Registration:** User's biometric information is captured and stored in a database (e.g., a fingerprint template).
    2.  **Authentication:**
        *   User presents their biometric feature (e.g., places finger on scanner).
        *   The system extracts data from the presented feature.
        *   This extracted data is compared with the previously stored information in the database.
        *   Based on the comparison, the user is either **certified** (authenticated) or **rejected**.

### 3.4 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **Concept:** Combines two or more different authentication methods to verify a user's identity.
*   **Purpose:** Significantly improves security by overcoming the weaknesses of any single authentication method. Even if one factor is compromised, the attacker still needs to compromise another different factor.
*   **Example:** Using a password ("what you know") plus an OTP from a phone app ("what you have").

+ Encryption  based on the password
Both the hash function  and encryption  are techniques  of hiding the password  effectively.  However,  there is a
difference,  in that the encryption  algorithm  can encrypt  the unencrypted  plaintext  and then decrypt  it again,
whereas  the hash function  cannot  find the original value of the hash function  using the result value.
The hash function  can be used for password-based  encryption  (PBE). In PBE, the hash value, which is
obtained  by entering  the result of combining  the password and salt (random number  generated  using a
pseudo-random  number  generator)  into the hash function,  is used as an encryption  key. Attacks  against  the
password  can be prevented  using this method.
+ Electronic  signature
The hash function  can be used for digital signatures.  A digital signature  is a method of providing both data
integrity  and the signature’s  authentication  by performing  a hash operation  on a specific  document,  using the
signature’s  private key. Signing  the entire message  is very inefficient  because  the public key operation  should
be repetitively  performed  on all message  blocks. Therefore,  an electronic  signature  can be very efficiently
generated  by calculating  a hash value for the message  and signing  on that value. Although  the signer  signed
the hash value, instead of the message  itself, this signature  is recognized  as a genuine signature  for the
message  because  finding  another  message  with the same hash value is difficult.

A) Concept  of authentication
Authentication  refers to a method  of verifying  whether  the information  exchanged  between  the sender and
receiver,  who are the subject of the information,  has not been altered or deleted,  and whether  the subject

(sender  and receiver)  is legitimate.  That is, authentication  can be divided into message  authentication  and user
authentication.
@ User  authentication
User authentication  refers to a function  that enables  the user to prove their identity  to the other party over
the network.  Given this, a third party should not be able to disguise  as the user.

[Figure 14] User authentication
User authentication,  also known as identification,  is used to verify the identity  of a user when logging in to a
server, and to grant the authority  of using information  services.  Servers should require the remote user to go
through  a strict authentication  procedure  because  the remote user can perform  all the privileges  as the user in
question,  once authenticated.
@ Message  authentication
Message  authentication  is to check whether  the contents  of the transmitted  message  have the original
information  and are not altered or modified.  An electronic  signature  can be used to verify that the transmitted
message  has not be altered,  and to identify  the sender  at the same time.
B) Type of authentication  methods
Authentication can be performed  by using the user’s knowledge,  the user's object, or the user’s physical
characteristics.
@® Knowledge-based  authentication
This method  is based on the user's information  (“What  you know’), and uses various means, such as a PIN
(Personal Identification  Number),  password,  account  number,  etc.
@ Ownership-based  authentication
This method  is based on the user’s possessions  (“What  you have’), and uses various means, such as anOTP (One
Time Password),  smart card, card key, etc.
® Presence-based  authentication
This method is based on the user’s body or characteristics  of their body ("What you are”), and uses various
means, such as iris recognition,  fingerprint  recognition,  voice recognition,  and face recognition.

@® Password  authentication
* Overview  of password  authentication
The user sets the password  in advance.  After that, the user is authenticated  by comparing  the password
entered during authentication,  with the set password.  Although  this authentication  technology  is the most
widely used, it requires  careful attention  when using it because  it is the most insecure  as shown in [Figure 15].
