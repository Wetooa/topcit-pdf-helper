# Learning Guide: Data Compression & Embedded Systems

## 1. Data Compression Fundamentals

Data compression is essential for efficient storage and transmission. This section covers video and audio data compression techniques and common standards.

### 1.1 Video Data Compression

Video files, being composed of many images (frames), require high transmission rates. Compression reduces this need.

*   **Spatial Compression:**
    *   Compresses each video frame independently, much like compressing a single image (e.g., JPEG for still images).
*   **Temporal Compression:**
    *   Removes redundant data between consecutive frames.
    *   Frames are categorized:
        *   **I-frames (Independent frames):** Complete, stand-alone images.
        *   **P-frames (Predictive frames):** Store only changes from a previous I-frame or P-frame.
        *   **B-frames (Bi-directional frames):** Store changes from both preceding and following I-frames or P-frames, offering higher compression.

### 1.2 Audio Data Digitization

Analog audio signals are converted into digital data using an **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**. This involves two main processes:

*   **Sampling:** Measuring the analog signal's amplitude at regular intervals.
*   **Quantization:** Assigning a discrete numerical value to each sampled amplitude.

### 1.3 Video Compression Standards (MPEG)

The **Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)** is an international organization that sets standards for video and audio compression.

| Standard Type  | Key Features                                   | Common Applications                  |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **MPEG-1**     | Audio and video compression/decompression      | MP3, Video CD                        |
| **MPEG-2**     | Compression/decompression for DTV broadcasting | Digital TV (DTV), DVD                |
| **MPEG-4**     | Mobile phone video compression                 | IMT2000, Internet broadcasting       |
| **AVC/H.264**  | Twice the compression rate of MPEG-2           | HDTV, mobile phone video             |
| **MPEG-V**     | VR media presentation and control              | 4D movies, Virtual Reality (VR)      |
| **MPEG-DASH**  | Internet-based video streaming                 | Internet image streaming             |
| **HEVC/H.265** | Twice the compression rate of AVC              | UHDTV, Smart TV                      |
| **3D Audio**   | Adds dimensions to existing surround audio     | UHDTV, Smart TV (part of newer MPEG) |

### 1.4 Advanced Video Codecs

*   **AVC (Advanced Video Coding) / H.264:**
    *   A video compression technology developed jointly by ITU-T (named H.264) and ISO (named MPEG4 Part 10/AVC).
*   **HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) / H.265:**
    *   The successor to AVC, offering significantly higher compression efficiency.

## 2. Introduction to Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a specialized computer system designed to perform a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.

### 2.1 Definition of an Embedded System

*   A **computer system** built into a product to perform a **specific function** for controlling a machine or other systems.
*   Contains a **microprocessor** and a program tailored for that function.
*   More than just simple circuits; it's a dedicated computing unit.

### 2.2 Why Embedded Systems are Important

*   **Market Growth:** The market for embedded systems is growing explosively, driven by the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. It's predicted to reach $2.587 trillion by 2023.
*   **Key Growth Areas:** Demand is rapidly increasing in **automotive (connected cars)** and **medical fields**.
*   **Ubiquitous Applications:** Embedded systems are integral to almost every industry, from home appliances and smartphones to industrial control and aerospace.

### 2.3 Security Concerns in Embedded Systems

*   **Major Challenge:** Linking various embedded systems introduces security vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Impact:** Security breaches in medical equipment and automobiles can have severe consequences for public safety.
*   **Necessity:** Protecting embedded systems from unauthorized software, theft, and privacy breaches is crucial, requiring continuous development of security measures.

### 2.4 Embedded System Configuration

An embedded system consists of both hardware and software components.

#### Embedded Hardware

The physical components that make up the system:

*   **Microprocessor/Microcontroller:** The "brain" (equivalent to a CPU).
*   **Memory:** For storing programs and data.
*   **Input/Output (I/O) Devices:** For interacting with the external world.
*   **Network Device:** For communication.
*   **Sensors:** To gather data from the environment.
*   **Drivers:** To control other devices.

#### Embedded Software

The programs that run on the hardware:

*   **Operating System (OS):** Directly controls hardware and manages software (e.g., **RTOS**, **Embedded Linux**, **Windows CE**).
*   **System Software:** Programs that manage and maintain the computer and its resources.
*   **Application Software:** Programs that perform the specific tasks the embedded system is designed for.
*   **Key Characteristic:** Designed to respond appropriately to the physical world, often considering factors like time, energy, and permanence.

### 2.5 Examples of Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are used in a vast range of devices:

*   **Offices:** Telephones, fax machines, copiers, scanners.
*   **Games:** Arcade and console game machines.
*   **Industry/Control:** Automation systems, industrial accident diagnosis, fire systems.
*   **Vehicles/Transportation:** Engine controls, navigators, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), subway electrical controls.
*   **Logistics/Finance:** Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, ATMs, card readers.
*   **Medicine:** Diabetes meters, ECG meters, MRI systems.
*   **Wearable:** Smartwatches, health bands.
*   **Digital Advertising:** Signage systems, Digital Information Displays (DID).
*   **Aviation/Shipbuilding:** Control systems, signal systems.
*   **Robots/Drones:** Industrial robots, educational robots, filming drones.

### 2.6 Characteristics of Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are designed with specific goals in mind, leading to distinct characteristics:

*   **Optimized for Specific Tasks:** Designed to perform a dedicated function, allowing for highly tailored and efficient designs.
*   **Low Cost:** Many embedded systems are mass-produced, so minimizing production costs is crucial. This often involves using slower processors and smaller memory sizes if high raw performance isn't required for the task.
*   **Resource-Efficient Design:** Performance is often optimized for the specific mission, rather than aiming for general-purpose high performance. This means components are selected to meet the task requirements while keeping cost, power consumption, and size down.
*   **High Reliability:** Essential for critical applications (e.g., medical, automotive) where failure can have serious consequences.
*   **Small Form Factor:** Often designed to be compact to fit within the device they control.
*   **Low Power Consumption:** Critical for battery-powered or energy-constrained devices.

Video data is composed  of several  frames.  Since each frame is an image, a video file requires  a high transmission  rate.
Video data can be compressed  with a spatial compression  or a temporal  compression  method.  JPEG performs  spatial
compression  of each frame, and each frame is compressed  independently.  Temporal  compression  removes  redundant
frames and configures each frame into I-frames,  which are independent  frames, B-frames,  and P-frames,  which
