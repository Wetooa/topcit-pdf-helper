[Fig. 47] Transformation  of the business  environment
Many companies  that have entered the global market are now experiencing  difficulties  because  of the long global
economic  downturn  and low growth. As domestic  growth slows and direct overseas  investments increase,  the
costs that companies  have to bear are increasing,  while the corporate  business  environment  is becoming  ever more
complicated  due to the opening  of markets  and fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates. To overcome  this situation,
large companies  are implementing  a number  of different  strategies,  such as expanding  global sourcing  and entering

and create new synergies.  In addition,  new business  concepts  have emerged  that reflect the latest consumption
trends, such as SNS-based  smart shopping  and the growth of one-person  Internet  co...
