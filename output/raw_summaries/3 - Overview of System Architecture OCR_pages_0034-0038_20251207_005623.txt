## Network Communication Basics & Protocols Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to Network Communication

Networks allow computers to exchange data. Even common actions like browsing a website involve many hidden network processes.

**Example Network Configuration (User A's Computer):**
*   **IPv4 Address:** 192.168.11.5 (Your computer's unique ID on its local network)
*   **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0 (Defines which part of the IP address is the network and which is the host)
*   **Gateway:** 192.168.11.1 (The device, usually a router, that connects your local network to other networks, like the internet)
*   **DHCP Server:** 192.168.11.1 (Assigns IP addresses automatically to devices on your local network)
*   **DNS Server:** 192.168.11.1 (Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses)

**Example Web Server (my.server.com):**
*   **IPv4 Address:** 220.17.23.15

### 2. Web Request Scenario: User A Accessing "my.server.com"

This describes the step-by-step process when a user types a URL into a web browser.

1.  **URL Entry & DNS Resolution:**
    *   User A enters `http://my.server.com/` and presses Enter.
    *   The web browser needs the **IP address** for `my.server.com` because computers communicate using IPs, not domain names.
    *   The browser sends a request to the **Domain Name System (DNS) server** (e.g., 192.168.11.1) to resolve `my.server.com`'s IP.
    *   The DNS server returns the IP address, e.g., `220.17.23.15`.

2.  **Preparing the Request Packet:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The browser prepares an **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** request for the homepage content.
    *   **TCP Encapsulation:** The HTTP request is passed to the **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** layer. TCP adds header information to ensure reliable delivery, breaks data into segments, and sends it to the web server program.
    *   **IP Encapsulation:** The TCP segment is then passed to the **IP (Internet Protocol)** layer. IP adds its own header, including the source IP (192.168.11.5) and destination IP (220.17.23.15), to route the packet across networks. This forms an IP packet.

3.  **Sending Packet to Gateway (Local Network Transfer):**
    *   User A's computer (192.168.11.5) cannot directly send the packet to `my.server.com` (220.17.23.15) because it's on a different network.
    *   The packet must first be sent to the **gateway** (router B: 192.168.11.1) on the local network.
    *   For data transfer within a local network, a **MAC address (Media Access Control address)** is needed, not an IP address.
    *   User A's computer uses **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** to broadcast a request on its local network to find the MAC address corresponding to the gateway's IP (192.168.11.1).
    *   Once the gateway's MAC address is obtained, the IP packet is encapsulated in an **Ethernet frame** and transmitted to router B.
    *   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** If User A is on a private network (like 192.168.11.0), the gateway performs NAT to translate User A's private IP to a public IP before sending it to the internet.

4.  **Routing Across Networks (Router B to Router C):**
    *   Router B receives the packet. It examines the destination IP (220.17.23.15) in the IP header.
    *   Since the destination is not on its directly connected networks (192.168.11.0 or 14.32.172.0), router B uses its **routing table** (via a **routing protocol**) to forward the packet to the next appropriate router, in this case, router C.

5.  **Sending Packet to Destination Server (Router C to my.server.com):**
    *   Router C receives the packet and recognizes that the destination network (220.17.23.0) is local to it.
    *   Similar to Step 3, for local network transfer, Router C needs the MAC address of `my.server.com` (220.17.23.15).
    *   Router C uses **ARP** to find `my.server.com`'s MAC address and then sends the packet directly to the server.

6.  **Server Receives and Processes Request:**
    *   `my.server.com` receives the packet.
    *   **IP Processing:** It examines the destination IP address, confirms it's for itself, and removes the IP header. The remaining TCP segment is passed up.
    *   **TCP Processing:** It determines which application (e.g., the web server software) should receive the data, removes the TCP header, and passes the actual HTTP request data to the web server application.

7.  **Server Sends Response:**
    *   The web server application processes the **HTTP request** and generates the homepage content.
    *   This content goes through the same encapsulation process in reverse (HTTP -> TCP -> IP -> Ethernet) and is sent back to User A's computer.

8.  **User A's Browser Displays Content:**
    *   User A's computer receives the response packet.
    *   The data is de-encapsulated (Ethernet -> IP -> TCP -> HTTP).
    *   The web browser receives the **HTTP response** containing the homepage content (e.g., **HTML**).
    *   The browser renders and displays the content for User A to view.

### 3. Understanding Network Protocols

A **protocol** is a standardized set of rules for sending and receiving data through a network. Without common protocols, devices couldn't understand each other.

**Protocol Standardization Organizations:**
*   **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** Responsible for most Internet-related standard protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, HTTP).
*   **3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) / 3GPP2:** Focuses on wireless communication protocols (e.g., GSM, CDMA, UMTS, LTE).
*   **ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector):** Handles protocols related to telecommunications, including telephones.

**Software vs. Physical Layers:**
*   **Physical Layer:** Involves hardware like cables and switches, operating with electrical signals.
*   **Protocol Layers (above Data Link Layer):** Primarily implemented and operated in software, defining how data is formatted and processed.

### 4. OSI Reference Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The **OSI Reference Model** is a conceptual framework (not a protocol itself) that describes how network communication works. It divides network communication into seven distinct layers.

*   **ISO** (International Organization for Standardization) developed the OSI model. **OSI** stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**.

**OSI Layers, Protocols & Functions:**

| Layer | Protocols (Examples) | Function |
| :---- | :------------------- | :------- |
| **7. Application Layer** | HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, FTP, Telnet | Provides network services directly to end-user applications; deals with user interface, email, database management. |
| **6. Presentation Layer** | JPEG, MPEG, XDR | Handles data format, syntax, encryption, decryption, compression, and translation between different data representations. |
| **5. Session Layer** | TLS, SSH, RPC, NetBIOS | Manages communication sessions between applications, establishing, maintaining, and synchronizing interactions. |
| **4. Transport Layer** | TCP, UDP, SCTP | Provides reliable (TCP) or unreliable (UDP) end-to-end message transfer between processes, including error control and flow control. |
| **3. Network Layer** | IP, IPX, ICMP, X.25, ARP, OSPF | Responsible for logical addressing and packet routing across different networks, from source to destination. |
| **2. Data Link Layer** | Ethernet, PPP, MAC | Provides reliable data transfer between directly connected network nodes (frames), handles physical addressing (MAC), and error detection on the link. |
| **1. Physical Layer** | USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet (physical), Wi-Fi (physical) | Defines physical characteristics of the network, including electrical signals, cabling, connectors, and how bits are transmitted over the physical medium. |

Siy))) The web browser  intends to send User A’s request  to the webserver,
my.server.com,  but cannot do it because  my.server.com  is an arbitrary
domain name for users to recognize  easily. The web browser  requests
the IP address  of my.server.com  to the domain name server to solve the

Step 3-4) ) On receiving  the packet  from user A’s computer,  wired/wireless  router B, aware
that the packet is not sent to the router as the final destination,  examines  the
address  to which the packet must be transmitted.  The IP header  indicates  that
the packet's  final destination  is myservercom,  and since it does not belong to
network  192.168.11.0  or 14.32.172.0,  to which wired/Wireless  router B belongs,  it
transmits  the packet  to router  C, to which it belongs  (routing  protocol).
On receiving  the packet, router C recognizes  that the packet is sent to
network  220.17.23.0,  to which the router belongs,  and intends  to transmit  it
to the webserver’s  IP address  220.17.23.15.  As in Step 3.3, since the packet
movement  in a network  requires  the physical  address  of my.server.com,  the
MAC address,  it obtains  the MAC address  corresponding  to the IP address
of my.server.com,  220.17.23.15,  though the network  broadcasting,  and
transmits  the packet  (ARP).
On receiving  the packet, my.server.com  examines  the IP address  and
recognizes  that the packet  was sent to it. It removes  the header  data, such as
the IP address,  and sends the remaining  data up to the higher  protocol  layer (IP).
It determines  which application  of my.server.com  to which the packet
should be transmitted,  removes  unneeded  data, and sends the remaining
data to the intended  webserver  application  (TCP).
