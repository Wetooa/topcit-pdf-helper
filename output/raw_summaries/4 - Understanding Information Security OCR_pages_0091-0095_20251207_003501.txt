## Database Encryption: A Learning Guide

This guide covers types of database encryption, how to apply one-way and two-way cipher algorithms, and the procedure for implementing database encryption.

### I. Types of Database Encryption

Database encryption methods vary in how they integrate with your system. The main types are:

1.  **API Method**
    *   **How it works:** An encryption/decryption module is installed directly within the **application program server (AP server)**.
    *   **Process:** The application encrypts/decrypts data *before* sending it to or receiving it from the database server.
    *   **Modification:** Requires **modification of multiple application programs**.
    *   **Load:** Creates a load on the **AP server** (low load on the database server).
    *   **Data Transmission:** Data is transmitted **encrypted** between the AP server and database server.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use if application programs are easy to modify and the database server's performance is poor.

2.  **Plug-in Type**
    *   **How it works:** The encryption/decryption module is installed directly within the **database server**.
    *   **Process:** The database server handles encryption/decryption internally.
    *   **Modification:** Requires **no modification** to application programs.
    *   **Load:** Creates a load on the **database server**.
    *   **Data Transmission:** Data is exchanged in **plain text** between the AP server and database server, then encrypted/decrypted within the DBMS.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use if database performance is good and application programs are difficult/impossible to modify.

3.  **TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) Method**
    *   **How it works:** Uses the **built-in or optional encryption/decryption function of the DBMS kernel**.
    *   **Process:** Encryption/decryption occurs at the DBMS kernel level, transparent to applications.
    *   **Modification:** Requires **no modification** to application programs.
    *   **Support:** **Depends on the specific DBMS type and version.** Not universally supported.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider when introducing a new DBMS that supports TDE.

### II. Applying Database Encryption Algorithms

Database encryption uses two main types of cipher algorithms:

#### A. One-Way Cipher Algorithm (Hashing)

*   **Purpose:** To make **original data extraction impossible** from the encrypted output. Primarily used for passwords.
*   **Method:** Uses a **cryptographic hash function**.
*   **Standard:** Generally uses **SHA-256 or higher** (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512). MD5 and SHA-1 are considered insecure.

**Application Scenarios:**

1.  **When data (e.g., passwords) is stored in plain text:**
    *   **Problem:** Plain text passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks (e.g., Rainbow attacks).
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Add a **SALT value** (a random string) to the user's password.
        2.  Apply a hash cipher algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to the combined password + SALT.
        3.  Store the resulting hash value.
        4.  Store the SALT value in a secure, separate location.

2.  **When an insecure hash algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) is used:**
    *   **Problem:** Insecure hashes are vulnerable to collisions and brute-force attacks.
    *   **Solution (Migration Strategy):**
        1.  First, convert existing insecure hash values into **double-hashed values** by applying SHA-256. Store these.
        2.  For **successfully logged-in users only**, gradually convert their double-hashed data into **single SHA-256 hash values**.
        3.  Use the login success time or a separate flag to track conversion status (single vs. double hash).

#### B. Two-Way Cipher Algorithm (Encryption/Decryption)

*   **Purpose:** To **encrypt and decrypt data**, allowing secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information. Primarily used for personal information.
*   **Method:** Uses **secure block cipher algorithms**.
*   **Standard:** Generally uses **SEED, ARIA, or AES (Rijndael)**. DES and 3-DES are considered insecure.

**Application Scenarios:**

1.  **When data (e.g., personal information) is stored in plain text:**
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Encrypt the plain text data using a **128-bit or higher secret key**.
        2.  Store the encrypted data.
        3.  Store the **secret key in a separate, safe place**.

2.  **When an insecure block cipher algorithm (e.g., DES, 3-DES) is used:**
    *   **Problem:** Insecure block ciphers are vulnerable to cryptanalysis.
    *   **Solution (Migration Strategy):**
        1.  Use a **batch job processing method**.
        2.  **Decrypt** the existing encrypted data (using the old insecure algorithm).
        3.  **Re-encrypt** the decrypted data using a secure block encryption algorithm (e.g., SEED, ARIA, AES).

### III. Procedure for Applying Database Encryption

Applying database encryption involves a structured, multi-phase process:

1.  **Prior Consultation**
    *   **Goal:** Share necessary information and align stakeholders *before* applying encryption.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Environmental survey (system, DBMS, application info).
        *   Security policy consultation.
        *   Schedule consultation.

2.  **Prior Impact Analysis**
    *   **Goal:** Analyze the potential impact on performance and system resources *before* implementing encryption on the operational system. This is a critical phase.
    *   **Activities (Pre-diagnosis):**
        *   **Selecting an encryption target:** Identify specific tables and columns that need encryption.
        *   **Analyzing query statements:** Examine SQL queries for performance impact, identify those needing optimization.
        *   **Analyzing DBMS:** Check CPU, memory, storage usage; calculate additional resources required post-encryption.
        *   **Analyzing applications:** Identify application modules affected by encryption.

3.  **Test Verification**
    *   **Goal:** Validate functionality and performance in a test environment.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Set up a test environment.
        *   Perform unit tests.
        *   Perform integrated tests.

4.  **Build (Operation Server Application)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement encryption on the live operational server.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Apply encryption to the operation server.

5.  **Stabilization (Monitoring and Stabilization)**
    *   **Goal:** Monitor the system post-implementation to ensure stability and transfer knowledge.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Continuous monitoring.
        *   Stabilization efforts.
        *   Technology transfer and training for administrators.

C) Types of database  encryption
There are various  types of database  encryption,  such as the API type, plug-in type, TDE type, and hybrid type
or proxy type, that combines  the API and plug-in type.
@ API method
API type database  encryption  performs  encryption/decryption  by installing  an encryption/decryption  module
inside an application  program  server. It requires  the modification  of multiple  application  programs,  and data is
transmitted  after encryption  between  the AP server and database  server. There is a low possibility  that a load
is created  in the database  server, but a load is likely to be created  in the AP server.

[Figure  42] API type database  encryption
If the application  program is easy to modify and the performance  of the database  server is poor, it is
recommended  to select this type, as data is transmitted  after being encrypted  through  the network.
@ Plug-in  type
When the plug-in type is used, the encryption/decryption  module is installed  inside the database  server in
order to perform  encryption/decryption.  A load on the database  server may be created and data is exchanged
between  the AP server and database  server in plain text when it is encrypted/decrypted.

It is recommended  to select this type when database  performance  is good, and the application  program is
difficult  or impossible  to modify.
@ TDE method
A method of using the built-in or optional  encryption/decryption  function  of the database.  This type can be
supported,  depending  on the DBMS type and version. There is no modification  to the application  program
because  encryption/decryption  is performed  at the DBMS kernel level. However,  this type may not be
supported,  depending  on the DBMS type or version. The selection  of this type can be considered  when
introducing  a new DBMS.

D) Applying  database  encryption
The concepts  of a one-way  cipher algorithm  and a two-way  cipher algorithm  can be applied  to the database  as
follows:
® Application  of a one-way  cipher algorithm
Original data extraction  by computation  should be made impossible,  using a hash cipher algorithm  (one-way
cipher algorithm),  and a cryptographic  hash function,  above SHA-256,  is generally  used.
Currently,  there are two cases when the one-way  cipher algorithm  should be applied: when data is saved in
plain text in the existing  database,  and when an insecure  hash cipher algorithm,  such as MD5 or SHA~1, is used.

Information  security )
+ When data is stored in plain text
If passwords  are stored in plain text and the hash cipher algorithm  is applied only to passwords,  they may
be vulnerable to  dictionary  attacks, such as Rainbow  attacks.  Therefore, the SALT value, which is a random
string, should be added to the user's password,  and the hash cipher algorithm  should be applied. Then, the
SALT value should be stored in a safe place.

[Figure  45] When data is stored in plain text
+ If an insecure  hash cipher  algorithm  is used
If an insecure  hash cipher  algorithm,  such as MD5 or SHA~1, is used, the previously  stored hash value should
first be converted  into a double hashed value, by applying  the SHA-256  hash cipher algorithm,  before storing
it. Then, the data of the successfully  logged-in  user should be gradually  converted  into a single hash value,
using SHA-256,  before storing it. At this time, the login success  time should be used, or a separate  column
should be added in order to check whether  the data has a single hash value or a double hash value.
