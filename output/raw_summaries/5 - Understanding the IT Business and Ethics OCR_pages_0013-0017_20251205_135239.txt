>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
In the past, the perception  of IT among the business  community  was that IT could play an auxiliary  role
in business  processes,  but that nothing more could be expected  from it. However,  as digital technologies
have become  ever more deeply  embedded  in users’ lifestyles,  IT is being actively  integrated  into corporate
business  processes.  It is from this perspective  that people must understand  not only the concept  of (IT?)
business  but also the IT ecosystem  and IT value chain related  to IT business.
>> Learning  Objectives
1. To be able to explain  the concept  of IT business  and its characteristics.
2. To be able to explain the IT business  ecosystem.
3. To be able to explain the business  value chain after understanding  the IT resources  allocated  to
businesses  and the activities  (roles/functions?)  of such IT resources.

+ Preview  for practical  business
Alibaba,  a Chinese  e-commerce  company,  was listed on the New York Stock Exchange  on the morning  of
September  19, 2014. What's amazing  about Alibaba is that on the day of its listing, its stock price rose by
38 percent  to $231.4 billion (241.6 trillion won) in market  value, and Jack Ma, Alibaba’s  largest  shareholder,
quickly  became  China's  richest  man, with $25 billion (26 trillion won) in assets.
In 1999, Jack Ma, along with seventeen  friends,  founded  Alibaba,  an online shopping  mall that sells Chinese |
SME products  to companies  around the world from his apartment.  Alibaba’s  rapid growth began in 2000
with a $20 million investment  from Softbank's  Masayoshi  Son. Following  in the footsteps  of Alibaba a B2B
service,  the company  launched  "Taobao,"  an online shopping  mall for individuals  (C2C), “tmall.com’  an online
department  store for wealthy  customers,  and "Alipay,  an electronic  payment  service.  Today, Alibaba Group
has become  the world’s leading  online shopping  mall and fintech corporation.  Alibaba is also one of the
finest models  of success  in the IT business.  So what is the key success  factor (CSF) that has enabled  the
company  to out-maneuver  eBay, the global company  that previously  occupied  the dominant  position  in the
Chinese  market?
First, there are no transaction  fees at Alibaba's  online shopping  mall. Profits are generated  from advertising |
and search services,  Second,  the company  deployed  an innovative  logistics  system that can deliver  goods
to any address  in the vast Chinese  territory  in just 1~2 days, and, using the ‘Alipay’  service,  it tured China's
unreliable  e-commerce  into a trading channel trusted by the trading parties.  Third, it worked aggressively
to meet customer  requirements.  It supported  the practice  of ‘chat-purchase’  when shopping  through  the
Internet,  whereby  customers  can negotiate  the price of a product  by chatting  before making a purchase
decision.  Fourth, CEO Ma Yun's vision and strategy  inspired his employees  to dedicate  themselves  to the
