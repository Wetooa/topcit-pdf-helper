## Cloud Computing & Virtualization: A Learning Guide

This guide covers cloud service classifications, server virtualization technologies, and foundational cloud platforms.

### 1. Cloud Service Types (by Operation Form)

Cloud services are classified into three levels based on how they are operated and accessed:

*   **Public Cloud:**
    *   **Description:** Services disclosed to the public over the Internet.
    *   **Access:** Accessible to unspecified masses.
*   **Private Cloud:**
    *   **Description:** Services implemented over a closed network within an organization.
    *   **Access:** Only accessible to authorized users (e.g., enterprise employees).
*   **Hybrid Cloud:**
    *   **Description:** Combines both public and private cloud services.
    *   **Key Aspect:** Compatibility and seamless migration between public and private domains are crucial.

### 2. Server Virtualization Technology

**Definition:** Virtualization is a technology that abstracts computer resources. It can make:
    *   Multiple computers appear as a single server.
    *   One computer appear as multiple independent computers.

**Purpose:**
*   Maximize utilization rate of computer resources.
*   Improve management efficiency.

**Role in Cloud:** Cloud services heavily rely on virtualization (especially x86 virtualization) to provide abstract computing resources to users, overcoming physical limitations.

#### A) Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM)

*   **Definition:** A technology and logical platform for virtualizing a physical server. It enables running multiple operating systems on one physical machine.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Host OS:** The physical server.
    *   **Guest OS:** A virtually provided server (runs inside the hypervisor).

#### B) Hypervisor Types (by Installation Method)

1.  **Native Type (Type 1):**
    *   **Installation:** Installed directly on the physical hardware.
    *   **Host OS:** Does NOT require a host OS, saving resources.
    *   **Examples:** Xen, XenServer, VMware ESX, IBM Power Hypervisor, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM.
2.  **Hosted Type (Type 2):**
    *   **Installation:** Installed on an existing operating system, like a conventional program.
    *   **Examples:** Microsoft VirtualPC, VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox.

#### C) Server Virtualization Methods

Server virtualization can be classified by *how* it virtualizes resources:

1.  **Full Virtualization:**
    *   **Hardware Emulation:** Completely virtualizes hardware. The hypervisor emulates hardware resources.
    *   **Guest OS Perception:** Guest OS believes it has direct, exclusive access to hardware.
    *   **CPU Requirement:** Requires CPU support for virtualization (e.g., Intel VT, AMD-V) for efficient hardware emulation.
    *   **Guest OS Modification:** No modification needed for the Guest OS, allowing diverse OS types (e.g., Linux and Windows) to run simultaneously.
    *   **Performance:** Improved by CPU hardware assistance.
    *   **Association:** Typically used by native hypervisors.
2.  **Para-virtualization:**
    *   **Hardware Emulation:** Does NOT completely virtualize hardware; no hardware emulation.
    *   **Guest OS Access:** Guest OS must communicate with the hypervisor via its API (Hypercall) to access hardware resources.
    *   **Guest OS Modification:** Requires partial modification of the Guest OS's kernel.
    *   **Performance:** High performance due to direct hypervisor interaction without emulation overhead.
    *   **Guest OS Limitation:** Generally limited to open-source Guest OSs due to the need for kernel modification.
3.  **OS-Level Virtualization (Container Technology):**
    *   **Approach:** Virtualizes at the OS level, making it appear like multiple isolated environments are running *on* a single OS.
    *   **Hypervisor:** Does NOT use a hypervisor. It leverages the host OS's built-in container functions.
    *   **Resource Isolation:** Allocates and isolates resources (memory, storage, network) for each container independently.
    *   **Host/Guest OS:** The Guest OS within the container *must be the same* as the Host OS.
    *   **Characteristics:** Lighter and more portable than traditional virtualization.
    *   **Examples:** Solaris Containers, FreeBSD Jails, Linux Docker (LXC).
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Quick start and finish.
        *   High density (many containers on one OS).
        *   Low overhead (userspace isolation, no emulation).
        *   Supports application-specific container configurations.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Host OS-dependent (Guest OS must match Host OS).
        *   Cannot configure the kernel individually for each container.

#### D) Comparison: Hypervisor Virtualization vs. OS-Level Virtualization

| Feature                 | Hypervisor Virtualization                    | OS-Level Virtualization              |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Independence** | Fully independent in VM                      | Uses host OS                         |
| **OS Independence**     | Fully independent from host OS               | Host OS must be same as guest OS     |
| **Performance**         | High overhead (mitigated by hardware virt.)  | No overhead (lighter)                |
| **Management**          | Separately managed for each VM               | Centralized management of common software |
| **Application**         | Heterogeneous (Linux/Windows mixed)          | Resource integration in a single OS environment |
| **Examples**            | Xen, MS Virtual Server, KVM, VMware ESX      | Solaris, LXC, Docker                 |

### 3. Storage and Network Virtualization Technologies

#### A) Storage Virtualization

*   **Function:** Enables virtual allocation of only the minimum required storage space initially (using **thin-provisioning** technology).
*   **Benefit:** Allows integration and use of heterogeneous storage systems seamlessly.

#### B) Network Virtualization

*   **Function:** Implements network devices (e.g., L2/L3/L7 switches, firewalls, security devices) as virtual machines, instead of physical hardware appliances.
*   **Benefit:** Allows networking resources to operate separately through internal virtualization, even when sharing the same physical network infrastructure.

### 4. Cloud Platform

#### A) Definition of Cloud Platform

*   **Role:** A cloud operating system that collects, controls, and operates various resources like servers, storage, networks, and virtualization technologies.

#### B) OpenStack

*   **Definition:** An open-source project and community dedicated to developing software blocks for building public and private cloud computing platforms.
*   **Goal:** To establish industry standards for cloud computing platforms, independent of specific equipment types or vendor technologies.
*   **Main OpenStack Projects (Key Components):**
    *   **Nova:** Core component for automatic control and operation of large-scale virtual computer instances (compute service).
    *   **Swift:** Implements large-scale, reliable cloud object storage services (object storage).
    *   **Glance:** Manages virtual disk image files (storage, registration, management, delivery).
    *   **Keystone:** Provides integrated authentication and authority services (identity service).
    *   **Cinder:** Offers block storage services, including volume replication and snapshot support (block storage).

B) Classification  according  to the cloud operation  form
Cloud services  can be classified  into three levels, based on the service  operation  form. The following  table shows the
classification,

03 Server  Virtualization  Technology
The conventional  computing  environment  generally  installs an OS-dependent  on single hardware  and runs
applications  above the OS. Virtualization  refers to the technology  of abstracting  the computer  resources  of multiple
computers  to make them look like servers, or by abstracting  the computer  resources  of a computer  to make them
look like multiple  computers.  Since the server  virtualization  technology  makes it possible  to run one or more operating
systems  on a computer,  it can maximize  the utilization  rate of computer  resources  and management  efficiency.
Cloud services  generally  use virtualization  technology  to provide abstract  computer  resources  to users. The x86
virtualization  technology,  in particular,  has been rapidly spread, based on the technology  and market  maturity,  and has
become  the basis of the cloud computing  environment  for the logic sharing and allocation  of computing  resources
beyond  the physical  limitations.
A) Hypervisor
In server  virtualization,  a host OS is a physical  server, and a guest OS is a virtually  provided  server. Server  virtualization
technology  can be classified,  according  to how a virtual server allocates physical  resources in order to make it look
like a physical server. A hypervisor  is a technology  of virtualizing  a physical server. It is a logical platform  for server
virtualization.  It is also called a virtual machine  monitor  (VMM). The hypervisor  can be classified  by how it is installed
and virtualized.
B) Hypervisor  types
Hyperviors  are classified  into native types and hosted types, according  to the installation  method.  The native type
is installed  directly on the hardware,  while the hosted type (see [Figure 95]) is installed  on an OS, like conventional
programs.

@ Native type
This type installs a VMM on physical hardware  and requires  no host OS. It saves resources,  compared  to the
virtualization  requiring  a host OS, since there is no host OS. The native type is also called type1. The leading  native
virtualization  technologies  include Xen, XenServer  from Citri, ESXServerBMWare,  Power Hypervisor  from IBM, and
Hyper-V  and KVM from Microsoft.
[Figure  95] Native Type Hypervisor
@ Hosted  type
The hosted hypervisor  (see [Figure 96]) is software  installed  on an existing  OS. The leading hosted type hypervisor
includes  VirtualPC  from Microsoft,  Workstation  from VMWare,  and VirtualBox  from Oracle.

© Full virtualization
Full virtualization  completely  virtualizes  the hardware.  Although  the guest OS perceives  that it owns and accesses
the hardware  directly,  the virtual server  uses the resources  that the hypervisor  emulates  to look like hardware.  If the
guest OS intends  to monopolize  the hardware,  the hypervisor  must handle  these commands  separately.  A CPU (Intel's
VT or AMD-V)  that supports  virtualization  is necessary  to emulate  hardware  resources,  other than the CPU, fully.
The performance  has greatly increased  since the hypervisor, included  in the CPU, handles  it at high speed. There is
no need to modify  the guest OS, since the CPU handles  full virtualization.  Therefore,  there are no restrictions  on the
guest OS. Linux-based  guest OS and Windows  guest OS can operate  simultaneously.  The native hypervisor  generally
corresponds  to full virtualization.
