# Information Security Learning Guide

## 1. Information Security Fundamentals

Information security involves protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

**Key Steps:**
*   **Risk Assessment:** Measure asset values, identify asset risk levels, and analyze vulnerabilities.
*   **Protective Measures:** Establish appropriate security measures within the organization.
*   **Resource Management:** Requires professional knowledge, time, and effort.

**Risk Assessment Approaches:**
1.  **Detailed Risk Approach:** Applied to major or high-risk systems.
2.  **Baseline Approach:** Applied to other systems.
    *   **Efficiency Note:** Clearly defining which approach to use for which system saves time and resources; misapplication can lead to wasted effort.

## 2. Information Security & Personal Information Management

### 2.1 ISMS-P (Information Security Management System - Personal Information)

**Overview:**
*   An integrated certification system that combines:
    *   **ISMS:** Information Security Management System
    *   **PIMS:** Personal Information Security Management
*   **Purpose:** Systematically protect both general information and personal information within a single framework.

**Composition of ISMS-P (102 Certification Criteria Items):**
1.  **Management Systems (16 Items):**
    *   Laying the foundation of the management system
    *   Risk management
    *   Operating the management system
    *   Checking and improving the management system
2.  **Protective Measures Requirements (64 Items):**
    *   Policy, organization, asset management
    *   Personnel security
    *   Outsider security
    *   Physical security
    *   Authentication and right management
    *   Access control
    *   Encryption application
    *   Security for information system introduction and development
    *   System and service operation management
    *   System and service security management
    *   Incident prevention and response
    *   Disaster recovery
3.  **Requirements for Each Personal Information Processing Stage (22 Items):**
    *   Protective measures when collecting personal information
    *   Protective measures when holding and using personal information
    *   Protective measures when providing personal information
    *   Protective measures when destroying personal information
    *   Protecting information owner's rights

### 2.2 Personal Information Protection Practices

**A. Privacy Policy & Consent:**
*   **Consent Method:**
    *   Present consent details *before* the user enters personal information.
    *   Allow users to *accept or reject* consent.
    *   Clearly state:
        *   Purpose of collection/use
        *   Items to be collected
        *   Retention and use period
        *   Disadvantages of rejection

**B. Personal Information Destruction:**
*   **When to Destroy:** Without delay when retention period expires or purpose of use is achieved.
*   **Method:** Irrecoverable destruction.
*   **Retention by Law:** If required by other laws, store *separately* from currently used personal information.
    *   Methods: Separate database or physically separated server.
    *   Access rights for separated data must be distinct to prevent unauthorized access.

**C. Access Control on Personal Information Processing Systems:**
*   **Goal:** Prevent illegal access, breaches, and detect leakage attempts.
*   **How:** Limit access rights for those handling personal information, analyze connected IP addresses.
*   **Methods:** ACL (Access Control List), Firewall, Intrusion Detection System (e.g., Snort).

**D. Encryption for Storing & Transmitting Personal Information:**
*   **General:** Encrypt personal information when storing or transmitting over networks to prevent illegal exposure or alteration.
*   **Passwords:** Store using *one-way encryption* (cannot be decrypted).
    *   Systems should offer temporary password or password reset features since lost passwords cannot be retrieved.
*   **Sensitive Data:** Uniquely identifiable information (e.g., resident registration number, passport, driver's license, biometrics) must be encrypted with secure algorithms.
*   **Transmission:** Apply encryption systems like SSL/TLS to transmission channels.

**E. Logging & Storage of Access Records:**
*   **Requirement:** Retain access records of personal information systems for at least 6 months.
*   **Content:** Log files tracking input/output, modification, data access details.
*   **Purpose:** Check for illegal access attempts.

## 3. Information Security Standards and Related Systems

### 3.1 ISO 27001:2013

*   **Definition:** International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and a certification system.
*   **Integration:** Can be combined with other ISO certifications (e.g., ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 for environment).
*   **Control Items:** 114 control items organized into 14 fields (updated from 133 items in 12 fields).

**Control Fields (Example):**
*   Information security policy
*   Information security organization

*   **Basis:** Data from application security specialists, industry surveys, and real-world applications/APIs.
*   **Ranking:** Based on prevalence, possibility, detectability, and impact of attacks.

**OWASP Top 10 - 2017 (Compared to 2013):**
*   **A1: Injection** (e.g., SQL injection)
*   **A2: Broken Authentication** (was "Broken authentication and session management")
*   **A3: Sensitive Data Exposure** (was "Cross Site Scripting (XSS)")
*   **A4: XML External Entities (XXE)** (New)
*   **A5: Broken Access Control** (Merged, was "Security misconfiguration")
*   **A6: Security Misconfiguration** (was "Sensitive data exposure")
*   **A7: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)** (was "Missing Function Level Access Control")
*   **A8: Insecure Deserialization** (New, Community)
*   **A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities** (was "Using known vulnerable components")
*   **A10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring** (New, Community)

### 3.3 CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

*   **Definition:** A classification system for software weakness items.
*   **Managed By:** MITRE (supported by U.S. Department of Homeland Security).
*   **Purpose:** Classifies software weaknesses based on views, categories, vulnerabilities, and complex elements.

### 3.4 CWSS (Common Weakness Scoring System)

*   **Definition:** A scoring system to determine the relative importance of various software vulnerabilities.
*   **Focus:** Vulnerabilities in architecture, design, code, or implementation that are critical security issues.

### 3.5 CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

*   **Definition:** A list of *discovered* security vulnerabilities over time (unlike CWE, which is a classification system).
*   **Purpose:** A record history of identified security vulnerabilities.
*   **Identification:** Managed with a unique ID system: "CVE-Year-Sequence".

### 3.6 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

*   **Definition:** An open framework used to assess and identify the severity of security vulnerabilities.
*   **Metrics:** Consists of three metric groups:
    *   **Basic Metric Group**
    *   **Temporary Metric Group**
    *   **Environmental Metric Group**
*   **Result:** Calculates an overall vulnerability score and its priority.

Information  security )
When the retention  period of collected  personal  information  has expired, or the purpose  of use has been
achieved,  personal  information  must be destroyed,  without  delay, in an irrecoverable  way. If the personal
information  must be retained  according  to other laws and regulations,  it must be stored separately  from
personal  information  that is currently  in use.
To store separately,  a separate  database  can be generated  and stored, or data can be stored in a physically
separated  server. The access  rights of the general personal  information  database  should be set differently  from
the personal  information  database  that is stored separately,  in order to prevent  unnecessary  access,  inquiries,
and leakage.
® Access  control on the personal  information  processing  system
Those who handle personal  information  should control unauthorized access by limiting the access rights, in
order to prevent illegal access and breach incidents  to the personal  information  processing  system,  and to
detect illegal attempts  to leak personal information  by analyzing  the connected  IP addresses.  The access
control method  includes  ACL (Access  Control List), firewall,  and free intrusion  detection  system (Snort).
@® Applying  encryption  when storing  and transmitting  personal  information
