## Networking Devices & Core Concepts (Pages 160-164)

### 1. Internetworking Equipment Overview

Internetworking devices connect networks and operate at different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models.

*   **Repeater:**
    *   **Function:** Amplifies or reproduces signals to extend network reach.
    *   **OSI/TCP/IP Layer:** Physical Layer / Network Access Layer (Hub, Repeater)

*   **Bridge:**
    *   **Function:** Connects two LANs, making them appear as one by interpreting and converting frame formats.
    *   **OSI/TCP/IP Layer:** Data Link Layer / Network Access Layer (Bridge, Switch)

*   **Switch:**
    *   **Function:** A multi-port bridge that separates network traffic based on MAC addresses.
    *   **OSI/TCP/IP Layer:** Data Link Layer / Network Access Layer (Bridge, Switch)

*   **Router:**
    *   **Function:** Finds the optimal communication path to forward packets between heterogeneous networks using IP addresses.
    *   **OSI/TCP/IP Layer:** Network Layer / Internet Layer

*   **Gateway:**
    *   **OSI/TCP/IP Layer:** Application Layer (Handles protocol conversion between different networks)

### 2. Router Deep Dive

A router is a key device for forwarding traffic and determining optimal paths.

*   **What is a Router?**
    *   Forwards packets from one network to another.
    *   Makes path decisions based on Network Layer (IP address) information.

*   **Router Structure:**
    *   **Control Plane:** Software-based; determines where to send packets using routing tables.
    *   **Forwarding Plane:** Hardware-based; actually sends packets based on decisions from the control plane.

*   **Router Metrics (Used to determine optimal paths):**
    *   **Number of Hops:** Number of routers a packet must pass through to reach its destination. Fewer hops usually mean higher speed.
    *   **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):** Maximum data size a protocol can transfer.
    *   **Cost:** Determined by transfer time, link reliability, and bandwidth. Higher cost means lower efficiency.
    *   **Latency:** Packet delay records and bottlenecks during transfer.

*   **Routing Table:**
    *   A database storing the output interface and next-hop IP address for each destination network.

### 3. Switch Deep Dive

A switch connects network units and performs important functions for LAN management.

*   **What is a Switch?**
    *   Connects network units.
    *   Key roles include MAC address learning, filtering, and loop prevention.
    *   Also supports port mirroring and VLANs.

*   **Main Switch Functions:**
    *   **Address Learning:** Learns the MAC addresses of all connected systems to specific ports.
    *   **Filtering:** Directs data traffic only to the relevant port using MAC addresses.
    *   **Loop Prevention:** Prevents network loops when multiple paths to a destination exist, typically using **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**.
    *   **Port Mirroring:** Sends a duplicate of data from one port to a "mirrored" port, used by administrators for traffic monitoring.

*   **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN):**
    *   **Purpose:** Configures logical networks independent of physical and regional constraints.
    *   **Method:** Groups devices into a logical network using criteria like IP unit, protocol unit, MAC address, or connecting port, rather than physical location.
    *   **Protocols:**
        *   **ISL (Inter-Switch Link):** VLAN tagging protocol (Cisco proprietary).
        *   **802.1Q:** Standard VLAN tagging protocol.
        *   **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol):** VLAN management protocol.

*   **Switch vs. Router Comparison:**

| Feature            | Switch               | Router                               |
| :----------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Reference Table**| MAC address table    | Routing table                        |
| **Reference PDU**  | Ethernet frame       | IP packet                            |
| **Reference Field**| Destination MAC addr | Destination IP address               |
| **Frames Used**    | Ethernet             | Ethernet, Frame Relay, PPP, etc.     |
| **L2 Header**      | No change            | Replaced by new header (for each hop)|

### 4. Network Layer Concepts

The Network Layer handles logical addressing, packet routing, and error reporting.

*   **Network Layer Encapsulation:**
    *   The process of adding a header to data (segment from Transport Layer) to create a packet for the Network Layer.
    *   **Decapsulation:** The reverse process on the receiving end, removing the header.

*   **IPv4 Header Structure (Key Fields):**
    *   **Version:** Protocol version of the datagram (e.g., IPv4).
    *   **IHL (Internet Header Length):** Length of the IPv4 header.
    *   **Type of Service (ToS):** Indicates the desired service quality for the packet.
    *   **Total Length:** Sum of header and data lengths in the datagram.
    *   **Time to Live (TTL):** Packet life limit; decremented at each hop to prevent infinite loops.
    *   **Protocol:** Identifies the next-level protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) for recombination.
    *   **Source Address:** 32-bit IP address of the sender.
    *   **Destination Address:** 32-bit IP address of the recipient.
    *   *(Other fields: Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset, Header Checksum, Options, Padding)*

*   **Packet Switching (Methods for finding packet paths):**
    *   **Datagram Approach:**
        *   **Connectionless:** Each packet is processed independently.
        *   Packets can travel via different paths.
        *   Forwarding path determined by the packet's destination address.
    *   **Virtual Circuit Approach:**
        *   **Connection-oriented:** A virtual path is established *before* data transfer.
        *   All packets for a session follow the same path.
        *   Forwarding path determined by a packet label (virtual circuit identifier).

*   **Network Layer Protocols/Commands:**
    *   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves an IP address to a MAC address.
    *   **RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves a MAC address to an IP address.
    *   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used to transfer network error information (e.g., ping).
    *   **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Used for IP multicast transfer (managing group memberships).

<Table 38) Internetworking  Equipment
Equipment Description
Repeater A device that enhances  (amplifies  or reproduces)  the signals between  AN connection  points
Bridge A device that connects  two LANs and makes them look like one, through interpretation  and format conversion
Switch A device that has the concept  of a multi-port  bridge to separate  the network,  based on the MAC address
Router A device that finds the optimal  communication  path when connecting  to a heterogeneous  network
This section describes  for which of the OS! 7 layers and TCP/IP 4 layers these internetworking  devices are
responsible.  The router performs  packet routing  through  the IP address  on the network  layer. The bridge and switch
are responsible  for frame transfer  on the datalink layer, while the hub and repeater  transfer  physical signals on the
physical  layer. <Table 39> compares  the function  of each device  with the protocol  layer.

D) What is a router?
A router forwards  traffic and determines  the optimal path, using one or more metrics. In other words, it forwards:
packets  from one network,  to another,  based on the network  layer information.
@ Router  structure
As shown in [Figure 114], a router mostly  consists  of a router control plane and a forwarding  plane. The control plane,
implemented  in the software  in a router, determines  where to send the packets  it receives  and uses tables to decide.
The forwarding  plane actually  sends the packets  according  to the requirements  created  by the control  plane.

A routing table is a database  that stores the output interface  of each destination  network  and the next hop IP
address.

E) What is a switch?
A switch is a device that connects  network  units. A switch device has an important  role in MAC address learning,
filtering,  and loop prevention.  Other switch functions  include port mirroring  and VLAN. Port mirroring,  also called
port monitoring,  is the function  of sending  a replicate  of the data sent from a specific  port to a mirrored  port. It is an
important  function  used by administrators  to monitor  network  traffic through  the mirrored  port.
<Table 41) Main Switch Functions
Function Description
Address  learning - Learning  the MAC address  of all systems  that are connected  to a port
Filtering - Filtering  data traffic to a specific port using the MAC address
Wooneevention - Preventing  a network  loop when multiple  paths to a destination  are generated
PP - The system usesa spanning  tree protocol (STP) to prevent  the network loop.
F) Virtual local area network  (VLAN)
VLAN is a method  of configuring  a logical network,  desired by the user, to overcome  the physical and regional
constraints  of the existing  networks. In other words, it uses the IP unit, protocol  unit, MAC address,  and connecting
port to configure  a logical network, instead of separating  networks  by spatial and geographical  locations.  The VLAN
protocols  of a switch include ISL, 802.1Q,  and VTP. ISL and 802.1Q are the VLAN tagging  protocols,  and VTP is a
VLAN management  protocol.
