## Learning Guide: System Architecture & Operating Systems

### 1. Network Protocol Architecture

Protocols define how different layers on separate hosts communicate. Each layer adds its specific header to the data received from the layer above.

*   **Application Layer:** Contains user data.
*   **Transport Layer (TCP/UDP):**
    *   Adds a **TCP header** (or UDP header).
    *   Provides **end-to-end communication** between applications on different hosts.
*   **Network Layer (IP):**
    *   Adds an **IP header**.
    *   Contains **routing information** to deliver data across networks.
    *   Treats the TCP/UDP header and user data as its payload.
*   **Data Link Layer (e.g., Ethernet):**
    *   Adds an **Ethernet header**.
    *   Contains information for **physical delivery** to other hosts within the **same network**.
    *   Treats the IP header, TCP/UDP header, and user data as its payload.
*   **Key Principle:** Each layer is responsible for its specific function and only uses its corresponding header.

### 2. Internet Address System

Internet communication relies on various addressing systems.

#### 2.1 MAC Address (Medium Access Control)

*   **Layer:** Data Link Layer.
*   **Purpose:** Transfers data frames between physically connected nodes (devices on the same local network).
*   **Location:** Generally stored on the Network Interface Card (NIC) hardware.
*   **Aliases:** Physical address, Ethernet Hardware Address (EHA).
*   **Format:** 48 bits long.
    *   First 24 bits: Hardware manufacturer's unique ID.
    *   Remaining 24 bits: NIC-dependent address.

#### 2.2 IP Address (Internet Protocol)

*   **Layer:** Network Layer.
*   **Purpose:** Transfers datagrams (data packets) between two hosts/routers across multiple Internet networks.
*   **Nature:** A **logical address**, unlike the physical MAC address.
*   **Versions:**
    *   **IPv4:** 32-bit system; widely used but faced exhaustion.
    *   **IPv6:** 128-bit system; introduced to solve IPv4 exhaustion, though IPv4 remains prevalent.
*   **Management:** ICANN (International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) allocates IP addresses.

#### 2.3 Port Number

*   **Layer:** Transport Layer (implicitly, for application-level connections).
*   **Purpose:** Transfers messages between specific **processes** (running applications) on two hosts.
*   **Format:** 16-bit number system, identifying up to 65,535 application programs.
*   **Categories:**
    *   **Well-known Ports (0-1023):** Allocated by IANA for common applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, email).
    *   **Registration Ports (1024-49,151):** Mostly used by servers for specific services (e.g., IRC 6667, Git 9418).
    *   **Dynamic/Temporary Ports (49,152-65,535):** Primarily used by clients as temporary connection numbers.

### 3. Internet Standards Organizations

Several organizations establish and maintain Internet-related standards.

*   **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** Defines core Internet protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP).
*   **ISO (International Organization for Standardization):** Global organization for intellectual, scientific, technological, and economic standards.
*   **ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication Standards Sector):** Responsible for telecommunication standardization (e.g., OSI reference model).
*   **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** Develops national standards in the US, especially for networking (e.g., 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi).
*   **EIA (Electronic Industries Association):** Unifies standards for dimensions, measurement, and labeling (e.g., TIA/EIA-568-B cabling).
*   **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium):** Establishes web standards for the long-term development of the web (e.g., HTML, CSS).
*   **OMA (Open Mobile Alliance):** Develops technical specifications for mobile data services.

### 4. Operating System (OS) Fundamentals

The Operating System is crucial for all electronic devices (computers, smartphones, etc.).

#### 4.1 Overview of OS

*   **Definition:** System software that efficiently manages a computer's limited hardware resources and provides an interface for users and applications.
*   **Importance:** Without an OS, even the best hardware is unusable; the OS allows users to interact with and utilize computer components.
*   **Role:**
    *   Controls computer resources.
    *   Implements usage policies through scheduling.
    *   Handles data exchange via input/output devices.
    *   Manages exceptions or errors.
*   **Key Purposes:**
    *   **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex hardware by providing standardized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to applications.
    *   **Virtualization:** Enables applications and users to share computer resources and use a single "virtual" computer.
    *   **Management:** Optimizes computer resource performance while adhering to constraints.

#### 4.2 Main Functions of OS

The OS manages key hardware components through several core functions:

*   **Process Management:**
    *   **Process:** A running program; a unit of work that allocates, uses, and recovers resources (CPU, storage, files, I/O) to perform tasks.
    *   **OS Tasks:**
        *   Create and dispose of user and system processes.
        *   Terminate and restart processes.
        *   Facilitate process communication and synchronization.
        *   Implement techniques to prevent deadlocks.
*   **Main Memory Unit Management:**
    *   **Main Memory (RAM):** The storage where the CPU fetches instructions and data. The CPU can only access data present in main memory.
    *   **OS Tasks:**
        *   Track and manage memory space and its users.
        *   Decide which process occupies specific memory space.
        *   Allocate and recover memory space for processes.
*   **File Management:**
    *   **Purpose:** To abstract the diverse physical characteristics of various storage media (e.g., hard disks, flash memory) into logical units called **files**.
    *   **OS Tasks:**
        *   Provide a consistent way for users and applications to store and access data, regardless of the underlying physical storage device.

Overview  of System Architecture )
As shown in [Figure 13], these protocols specify communication  with the same protocol layers of other hosts
connected  through a network.  For communication,  a header  for the exchanging  of data between  protocols  of the
same layer with data downloaded  from the layer immediately  above are generally  required.
As shown in [Figure 15], an application  layer can transmit  the user data through  a transport  protocol  TCP (or UDP),
which is an end-to-end  protocol  connected  to the other host. It requires  a TCP header  (or UDP header).
The transmission of user data, including a  TCP header, uses IP, which is a network  layer protocol  that has routing
information  to the network  of the other host, and the IP head has the information.
The network  layer considers  both the TCP header  and the user data received  from the transport  layer as data. The
data link protocol,  which has the necessary  information  for physical  delivery  to other hosts in the same network,
mostly uses Ethernet.  In that case, both the TCP header  and the user data, including  the Ethernet  header  with the
necessary  information  and the IP header  downloaded  from the network  layer, are regarded  as data. It should be noted
that each layer uses only the header  that corresponds  to the given function.

03 Internet  Address  System
Internet  users come across many terms related to numbers, such as a MAC address,  an IP address,  and a port
number.  It is unnecessary  to memorize  these numbers,  but understanding  the numbers  helps figure out each layer
protocol.  The MAC address,  IP address,  and port number  in the Internet  address  system  have the following  meanings:
@ MAC address:  The MAC (medium  access control)  address,  or the address  system used by the data link layer, is used
to transfer  frames between  the physically  connected  nodes. The information  is generally  stored on the LAN expansion
card hardware,  called NIC. It is also called the physical  address  or Ethernet  hardware  address  (EHA). It is formed by48
bits. The first 24 bits represent  the hardware  manufacturer's  unique ID, and the remaining  24 bits represent  the NIC-
dependent  address.
@IP address:  The IP address  is the address  system of the network  layer to transfer  datagram  between  two hosts/
routers. It facilitates  data to be transferred  from the source node to the destination  node, through  multiple  Internet
networks.  While the MAC address  is a physical address,  the IP address  is a logical address.  Existing IP addresses,  or

ESSENCE
IPv4 addresses  based on the 32-bit address system, faced exhaustion  as Internet  use increased  rapidly worldwide.
Although  the IPv6 address system based on 128 bits was introduced  to solve the problem,  IPv4 addresses  are still
mainly used. Although  the IANA (Internet  Assigned  Numbers  Authority)  was responsible  for IP address  allocation  in the
past, the ICANN (Intemational  Corporation  for Assigned  Names  and Numbers)  is currently  in charge.
© Port number:  The port number  used to transfer  messages  between  two processes  (running  applications)  is responsible
for the connection  between  the web browser  on user A’s computer,  shown in [Figure 10], and the webserver  program
on myserver.com.  The 16-bit number  system  can identify  up to 65,535 application  programs.  The port numbers  from
0 to 1023 are called well-known  ports and are allocated  by the IANA. Application  programs,  such as telnet and email,
use it for sending  and receiving  data. The port numbers  from 1024 to 49,151 are called registration  ports and, like well-
known ports, are mostly used by servers.  The Internet  chatting  protocol,  IRC (TCP port number  6667), and Git version
control system (TCP port number  9418) are examples.  The port numbers  from 49,152 to 65,535 are mostly used as a
temporary  number  by clients, and are called dynamic  ports or temporary  ports.
04 Internet  Standard
The IETF (Internet  Engineering  Task Force) is a leading  organization  responsible  for Internet-related  standards.  It
defines the basic protocols  for Internet  transmissions,  such as IP, TCP, and UDP, as well as the most widely used
protocols  in the Internet application  layer protocols,  such as HTTP. SSH, FTP, SMTP. POP3, and IMAP. <Table 3> lists
