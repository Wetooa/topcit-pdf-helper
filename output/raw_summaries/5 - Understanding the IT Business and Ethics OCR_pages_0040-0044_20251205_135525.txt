#### 1.1 SWOT Analysis

**Purpose:** A framework used to establish overall company strategy.

*   **Traditional Use:**
    *   Primarily for marketing activities.
    *   Based on abstract insights, not concrete data.
    *   Often seen as theoretical, lacking practical implications for strategy execution.
*   **Modern Relevance (with IT & Business Intelligence):**
    *   **Renewed Value:** Business Intelligence (BI) integration has revitalized SWOT.

    *   **Results:** Provides objective and future-predictive analysis.
    *   **Benefits:** Huge impact on marketing and overall company processes, leading to improved strategy quality.

#### 1.2 BCG Matrix (Boston Consulting Group Matrix)

**Purpose:** A market analysis technique to evaluate a company's portfolio of products and business services. Can also evaluate a single company or department.

*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Vertical Index:** Market Growth (External Environment)
    *   **Horizontal Index:** Market Share (Internal Environment)
*   **Four Quadrants:**
    *   **Question Mark (?):**
        *   **Characteristics:** Low market share, high growth potential.
        *   **Action:** Requires investment to increase market share.
    *   **Star (*):**
        *   **Characteristics:** High market share, high growth potential.
        *   **Action:** Needs continuous investment to maintain growth.
    *   **Dog:**
        *   **Characteristics:** Low market share, low growth potential.
        *   **Action:** Consider exiting the business.

**Concept:** The process of developing informatization strategies at the division level.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Derive detailed requirements for individual systems.
    *   Set up systems for efficient calculation and verification of business scope, schedules, and budgets.
*   **Integration with EA:** Uses current EA information to prevent overlapping and indiscriminate development activities.
*   **Recent Trend:** Public sector RFPs (Requests for Proposal) often require detailed specifications; ISP helps companies produce these.

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
Generally,  SWOT analysis  has primarily  been used to establish  strategies  related to a company’s  marketing  activities,
although  Universities  also rely on SWOT analysis  to teach marketing  to students.  Today, however,  SWOT analysis
is used in a variety of ways beyond the realm of marketing  activities,  and is used by companies  as an important
analytical  framework,  especially  from the perspective  of establishing  a company’s  overall strategy.
The reason why SWOT analysis  is receiving  renewed  attention  in today's corporate  IT business  environment  is
because  the role of business  intelligence  has become  very important  in establishing  strategic  directions  through  this
matrix. Even at the dawn of the twenty-first  century,  SWOT analysis  was used to derive a matrix strategy  based on
the arguments  of abstract  insights  rather  than on the incontrovertible  basis of concrete  data.
Therefore,  to assert that the real value of SWOT analysis  had been overrated  is nothing  less thanto speak the plain
truth. Since the person conducting  the analysis  uses abstract  arguments  based on his or her insights to create a
matrix, SWOT analysis  rarely provides  any practical  implications.  As such, it was viewed as a method of theoretical
analysis  to be performed  as a matter  a routine.  Of course, even without  data, SWOT analysis  offers a different  way of
looking  at and analyzing  a company,  and in that sense it provides  another  advantage.  However,  from the perspective
of a company  aiming to plan and execute  strategies  that could affect its survival as a business,  there is simply too
much of a gap between  what is expected  of this analysis  tool and what it can actually  deliver Therefore,  SWOT
analysis  cannot  become  an integral part of the execution  strategy  of a company’s  business  process.
But as IT business  becomes  fully integrated  into the operations  of a company,  the growing  use of business
intelligence  is reawakening  people to the value of SWOT analysis. In other words, as the development  of a matrix
strategy  through  SWOT analysis  becomes  increasingly enhanced  by high-quality  information  that can back up the
analysis  results, people have begun to obtain objective  and future-predictive  SWOT  analysis  results.
This way of formulating  strategy  using business intelligence-based  SWOT analysis is not only bringing  huge benefits
to the major areas of marketing  activity  but is also having  a substantial  effect on the overall processes  of companies.
As a side note, when we examine  cases of SWOT analysis performed by companies,  an unimaginable  amount  of
data is being analyzed  and made available  to companies  prior to the derivation  of their ideal matrix combinations.
Especially  quantified  numerical  data are analyzed  from many different  angles and presented  to decision  makers.
Because  the quality  of such objective  data is guaranteed,  the quality of company  strategies  developed  using SWOT
analysis  has been improving  steadily.
@ BCG Matrix
Conceived  as a technique  of market  analysis  by the Boston Consulting  Group (BCG), the BCG Matrix (market  growth
rate-market  share matrix) is used by companies  as a tool for evaluating  their portfolio  of products  and business
services  during their marketing  and sales planning  activities.  This tool evaluates  products  and business  services
with a two-dimensional  matrix consisting  of market  growth (external  environment)  as the vertical index and market
share (internal  environment)  as the horizontal  index. Products  are assessed  and put into one of four quadrants:  dog,
question  mark (?), star (*), and cash cow, as shown in the following  figure.

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics
>> Recent  trends and key issues
IT business  planning  starts with an understanding  of the company's  vision, goals, strategies and tasks,
and the first step is to build enterprise  architecture  (EA). In addition,  companies  also turn to information
strategy  planning  (ISP) when deploying  information  systems  for their IT division.
It is through  IT governance,  which stands  at the center ...
