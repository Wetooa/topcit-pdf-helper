## Learning Guide: Database Concepts & Data Warehousing

### I. Database Backup Methods

Database backups are crucial for data recovery. Here are common classification methods:

#### A. Classification by Backup Range

1.  **Full Backup**
    *   **Description:** Copies the entire database.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Takes a long time.
        *   High storage costs due to data duplication.

2.  **Differential Backup**
    *   **Description:** A cumulative backup of all changes made since the *last full backup*.
    *   **Example:** If full backup is Sunday, differential on Thursday copies all changes since Sunday.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Reduced data backed up compared to a full backup.
        *   Faster recovery: only the last full backup and the latest differential backup are needed.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Requires a full backup to exist.
        *   More data duplicated than incremental backups.

3.  **Incremental Backup**
    *   **Description:** Copies only data changed or created since the *previous backup* (could be full or another incremental).
    *   **Example:** If full backup is Sunday, and incremental backups run daily, Thursday's backup only copies changes since Wednesday's incremental.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Significantly reduced data backed up compared to full or differential.
        *   Least data duplication.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Requires a full backup to exist.
        *   Increased recovery time: the latest full backup and *all subsequent incremental backups* must be applied.
        *   Recovery fails if any incremental backup file is missing.

#### B. Classification by Transaction Record

1.  **Archive Log Backup**
    *   **Description:** Backs up the log file which records transaction execution details.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Allows recovery to a specific point in time by re-executing transactions from the log.
        *   Minimizes data loss; data can be restored to the state immediately before a failure.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Does not back up the database data itself; requires a separate data copy if the database is damaged.

### II. Data Analysis Systems: Trends & Importance

#### A. Recent Trends & Major Issues

*   **Shift to Buyer-Centered Business:** Enterprises need faster, more accurate decision-making for survival.
*   **Need for Analytical Systems:** To support data collection, storage, processing, presentation, and utilization for quick and accurate analysis of enterprise information (especially customer data).
*   **Key Analytical Systems Introduced:**
    *   **Data Warehouse (DW):** Stores large amounts of historical corporate information.
    *   **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Analyzes and utilizes DW data from various user perspectives.
    *   **Data Mining:** Finds new business insights from data.
*   **Evolution of DWs:**
    *   Transitioning from departmental DWs to **Enterprise Data Warehouses (EDW)** due to large-scale storage.
    *   Introduction of **semi-real-time data warehouses** with advanced processing technology.
    *   **Hadoop System** for big data analytics requires coexistence with existing analytical DWs.

#### B. Why Data Analysis is Important for Business

*   **Informed Decisions:** Businesses use analysis systems (e.g., CRM, SCM) to analyze accumulated data from various perspectives.
*   **Direct Business Impact:** Information derived from analysis directly supports management decisions, sales, marketing, and new product releases.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Retailers send personalized coupons based on shopping history to boost sales.
    *   Investment firms identify key customer segments (e.g., "thirties, ~KRW 30M financial assets, rural areas" are active purchasers) to develop targeted marketing and products.
*   **Growing Demand:** Increasing need for experts to build and operate data analysis systems.
*   **Key Technologies to Understand:** ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading), DW (Data Warehouse), and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

### III. Data Warehouse (DW)

#### A. Concept of Data Warehouse

*   An integrated system or database.
*   Enables instant analysis of internal and external operational data over time.
*   Integrates data by subject, without needing separate programming for multi-view analysis.

#### B. Characteristics of a Data Warehouse

Unlike OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems, a DW has distinct characteristics:

1.  **Subject-Oriented:**
    *   Focuses on data for specific subjects (e.g., customers, products) needed for decision-making.
    *   Excludes operational data not relevant to enterprise analysis.

2.  **Integrated:**
    *   Ensures data consistency and physical unity through company-wide standardization.
    *   Performs data conversion tasks when obtaining data from operational systems to integrate it.

3.  **Time-Variant:**
    *   Retains historical data in a series of snapshots for a long time.
    *   Enables analysis of past/present trends and future forecasting.
    *   Users can track data changes over time.

4.  **Non-Volatile:**
    *   A read-only database.
    *   Data cannot be deleted or modified once loaded from the operational system.
    *   Stores the history of data at each point in time, rather than updating existing records when operational data changes.

#### C. Data Warehouse Modeling

*   **Definition:** A data modeling technique for data analysis, enabling users to analyze large-scale data from various viewpoints.
*   **Components:** Data is organized into two main table types:

    1.  **Fact Table:**
        *   Core table composed of a set of highly relevant measures.
        *   **Measures:** Quantitative data used for analysis goals (e.g., amount, number, time, sales quantity, total sales).

    2.  **Dimension Table:**
        *   Sub-table providing different perspectives for analyzing each fact.
        *   Has multiple attributes, allowing diverse data analysis (e.g., Store, Product, Employee, Period).

#### D. Data Warehouse Modeling Techniques

These techniques organize data using fact and dimension tables to facilitate analysis.

1.  **Star Schema**
    *   **Description:** A modeling technique that separates data into a central fact table and surrounding dimension tables.
    *   **Normalization Status:** Dimension table data is *not normalized*, leading to data duplication within dimensions.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Easy to understand.
        *   Few joins needed for queries, improving query performance.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Data duplication occurs in dimension tables.
        *   Potential for data consistency problems.
        *   If dimension tables grow significantly, the number of records increases exponentially, and search speed decreases.

2.  **Snowflake Schema**
    *   *(Only mentioned as a technique, not detailed in the provided text. Assumed to involve normalized dimension tables.)*

>> Recent  trends and major issues
As the business  environment  has switched  from a seller-centered  model to a buyer-centered  model, ever
faster and more accurate  decision-making  is directly related to the survival of enterprises.  Accordingly,
analytical  systems  are needed  that support  a series of analysis  processes,  including  the collection,  storage,
processing,  presentation  and utilization  of data, in order to analyze enterprise  information  including
customers  more quickly and accurately.  In particular,  the data warehouse  (hereafter  referred  to as a “DW’)
for storing  large amounts  of corporate  information  accumulated  over time, the OLAP for diversely  analyzing
and utilizing  data from the user's perspective,  and data mining  for finding new business  insights  have been
introduced.
On the other hand, data warehouses  that were previously  available  for each area are now being replaced  by
the EDW (Enterprise  DW) due to the development  of large-scale  data storage  technology,  and semi-real-
time data warehouses  have also been introduced  due to the development  of data processing  technology.  In
addition,  as enterprises  are adopting  the Hadoop  system  for big data analytics,  its coexistence  with existing
analytics  data warehouses  is required.

+ Preview  for practical  business Why do we need to understand  data analysis?
Recently,  enterprises  in most industries  have begun using analysis  systems  for handling business  and
diverse  other various purposes,  such as CRM, SCM, etc, in order to analyze  accumulated  data from various
perspectives,  and to use the information  derived from such analysis directly in their business  operations,
including  management  decisions,  sales, marketing,  new product  releases,  etc. In fact, data analysis  systems
are becoming  increasingly  important  as the key system of enterprises’  business.  For example,  Mart A
