## Project Management & Technical Communication: Presentation Guide

### I. Presentation Delivery & Post-Processing

*   **Presentation Delivery:**
    *   Be **confident, concise, and clear**.
*   **Post-Processing (Q&A & Feedback):**
    *   **Purpose:** Answer questions, receive feedback, identify improvements.
    *   **Preparation:** Prepare for anticipated questions in advance to reduce nervousness.
    *   **Interaction:** Listen carefully, explain calmly and humbly.

### II. Scenario Creation

*   **Importance:** The most crucial part of presentation preparation. Don't just write presentation materials; create a separate scenario.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces tension during the actual presentation.
*   **Content Composition:**
    *   Reflects key presentation points from your materials.
    *   Order points considering **audience, purpose, and venue** due to time limits.
    *   Ensure efficient communication by checking the story's flow and keywords.
*   **Length:**
    *   **Rule of thumb:** Approximately 3 minutes per A4 sheet.
    *   **Key:** Structure to fit the allotted time, allowing for presentation and Q&A. Avoid exceeding the schedule.

### III. Writing Techniques for Presentation Material

#### A. Overall Material Composition

Standard structure: **Opening → Table of Contents → Main Text → Closing.**

1.  **Opening:**
    *   Crucial for first impressions. Success often determined within the first 30 seconds.
    *   Difficult to recover if a positive impression and trust aren't established early.
2.  **Table of Contents:**
    *   Structure based on briefing length and content complexity.
    *   **< 30 minutes:** Use a two-tiered structure.
    *   **> 1 hour:** Use a three-tiered structure.
3.  **Main Text: Content Organization Types**
    *   **Requested Order Type:**
        *   *Strength:* Easy to write, comprehensive.
        *   *Weakness:* Can include too much, losing the key message.
    *   **Key Issue Type:**
        *   *Strength:* Logical, good for connecting strategies to key issues.
        *   *Weakness:* May omit essential but non-core issues.
    *   **Presentation Evaluation Form Type:**
        *   *Strength:* Organized around an evaluator's form (focuses on their interests).
        *   *Weakness:* Presentation flow might seem unnatural.
4.  **Closing:**
    *   Summarize key content.
    *   Use feelings or quotes for a lasting impression.
    *   **Do NOT introduce new stories or topics.**

#### B. Presentation Scenario Creation (Detailed Steps)

1.  **Logic Development:**
    *   Adapt logic based on purpose, audience, and location.
    *   **Key Message First:**
        *   *When:* Presenting solutions, high-ranking audience.
        *   *Advantage:* Induces interest, retains attention quickly.
    *   **Key Message Last:**
        *   *When:* Dramatic story development, training audience.
        *   *Advantage:* Builds audience connection, ensures full understanding of the conclusion.
2.  **Structure Table of Contents:**
    *   Once logic is decided, build the table of contents.
    *   Start with first-level headings, then add detailed subsections.
3.  **Check Logic Flow:**
    *   Simulate the presentation based on your table of contents.
    *   Ensure there are no disturbances or breaks in the flow.
4.  **Define Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize presentation content.
    *   Organize final arguments or suggestions.
    *   Ensure the conclusion relates naturally to the logic development for the audience.

#### C. Presentation Material Creation

1.  **Things to Consider Beforehand:**
    *   **Storyboard:** Organize the overall presentation flow, table of contents, and clearly define the conclusion.
    *   **Visual Factors:**
        *   **Color:** Select based on audience (e.g., company's vision, Corporate Identity (CI) / Brand Identity (BI) for specific organizations). Adjust for venue brightness.
        *   **Font:** Use sans-serif fonts (e.g., Gothic). Titles: 20-24pt. Body: 14pt.
        *   **Other:** Materials should be easy to print (e.g., A4). Choose tools (PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi) based on the presentation environment.
2.  **Presentation Material Preparation Procedure (4 Steps):**
    1.  **Storyboard:** Summarize introduction, body, closing, message, and logical flow on one page.
    2.  **Draft:** Summarize main content and schematic patterns for each slide.
    3.  **Design:** Complete the material according to the composition and content determined in the mock-up stage.
    4.  **Refine:** Apply design to drafted content, including cover, table of contents, opening, and closing pages.
3.  **Template Selection:**
    *   Choose a template that is not overly complex or flashy.
    *   It should visually present the subject effectively.
    *   Typical components: Title, Heading (leading message), Body, Navigation, CI, Slide Number.
4.  **Layout Selection:**
    *   Use layouts provided by presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) or create custom ones.
    *   Common layout types: Cover, Section, Body.
    *   Focus on common body layouts.
5.  **Things to Consider for the Body Content:**
    *   Target content specifically for your audience (readers, reviewers).
    *   Write schematically and use simplified expressions.
    *   Use commonly recognized schematics.
    *   Utilize original images.
    *   Use appropriate fonts and colors.
    *   Leverage the message or feeling that colors convey.
6.  **How to Write Headings (Leading Message):**
    *   Headings are crucial; they state the key message first, with supporting material below.
    *   **One Message Per Page:** Each heading should cover only one topic. Multiple topics are distracting.
    *   **Appropriate Length:** 1-2 sentences. Not too short to be unclear, not too long to hinder readability.
    *   **Content:** Should include "What" or "Why," a summary of the conclusion, descriptions of key points, or facts/data.
    *   **Clarity:** Avoid ambiguous content; be as specific as possible.
7.  **Use of Charts:**
    *   Charts are vital for presenting arguments and convincing the audience.
    *   Select the appropriate chart type based on the characteristics of the data.
    *   **Common Chart Types:**
        *   **Comparison of Items:** Ranking, differences between items. *Effective charts: Horizontal Bar, Vertical Bar.*
        *   **Comparison of Time Series:** Change over time. *Effective chart: Line Graph.*
        *   **Comparison of Distribution:** Number of items in a whole range. *Effective chart: Vertical Bar Graph.*
        *   **Comparison of Composition:** Percentage of the whole. *Effective chart: Pie Chart.*
        *   **Correlation:** Relationship between variables. *Effective chart: Dot Graph.*
8.  **Basic Patterns of Visualization:**
    *   Using schematics is more effective than verbose writing for understanding.
    *   **Visualization Patterns:**
        *   **Method/Factor:** For listing different items and their specific details.
        *   **Sequence/Process:** For describing items in a specific order.
        *   **Parallel/Contrast:** For describing items with parallel relationships.
        *   **Table/Correlation:** For explaining cause-and-effect relationships.
    *   **Three Principles of Visualization:**
        1.  **Suitable Structure:** Select shape types based on keyword description method.
        2.  **Easy to Understand:** Structure logic for intuitive comprehension.
        3.  **Highlight Points:** Emphasize key points using color or other shapes.

#### D. Presentation Material Review

*   **Process:** After completing materials, have a third party review them from an objective perspective.
*   **Key Review Questions:**
    *   Was there a clear answer to the audience's needs?
    *   Is the emphasized content properly expressed?
    *   Are the materials differentiated and suitable for the subject?
    *   Is the logic of the argument/basis valid?
    *   Is the priority of content organized (does it contribute to achieving the purpose)?
    *   Is the text content logically structured?

@ Presentation
As with the rehearsal,  be confident  and concise  and clear in accordance  with the presentation  technique.
Post processing  (Q&A, feedback)
It is a step to answer questions  about the issues presented,  receive feedback  on the results of the
presentation, and check items to be improved.  If you prepare expected  questions  in advance,  you can answer
them without being nervous,  and you should be able to listen carefully  to the other person's  questions  and
explain  them in a humble  and calm manner.
C) Scenario  creation
When preparing  a presentation,  the most important  thing is the scenario.  Novice presenters  often make
the mistake of not writing presentation  materials  and writing scenarios.  Since the presentation  can be
nerve-wracking,  creating  a separate  scenario  in advance  and bringing  it with you will greatly ease the tension
during the presentation.
@® Content  Composition  of Scenario
Scenarios  derive and reflect important  presentation  points from presentation  materials.  Because  of the time
constraints,  the order of the points should be decided  in a way that the presentation  becomes  suitable  for the
audience,  purpose  (expectation),  and place. You need to write and check to make sure a lot of content  can be
communicated  efficiently,  by seeing  whether  the big flow of the story and keywords  are clearly identified.
@ Length of Scenario
Usually, it takes about 3 minutes  for each A4 sheet. Therefore,  it is necessary  to write  a scenario  for the
amount  of presentation  time given. Exceeding  the set time schedule  is what should be avoided  the most, and
scenario  should be structured  in a way that the presentation  can be finished within the set timeframe,  and
receive questions  and offer answers.
02 Writing  Techniques  of Presentation  Material
A) Overall material  composition
The entire material  is generally  organized  in the order of opening  — table of contents  — main text — closing.
+ The opening  is the time to show the presenter's  first impression,  and the success or failure of PT is
determined  within 30 seconds  of the start, and failure to build a positive impression  and trust becomes
difficult  to reverse.
* The table of  contents  should be structured  in consideration  of the length of the briefing session, and the
complexity  of the content.  Generally,  PTs within 30 minutes use a two-tiered  structure,  and a three-tiered
structure  for more than one hour.
* The main text can be divided into the following.

ESSENCE
+ Requested  Order Type
-(Strength)  Easy to write as requested  and can contain  all the contents
-(Weakness)  Too much content  may fail to deliver  the key message
+ Key Issue Type
-(Strength)  Logical and easy to structure  and connect  presentation  strategies  and key issues
-(Weakness)  Although  not a core issue, essential  parts for presentation  may be omitted
+ Presentation  Evaluation  Form Type
-(Strength)  If there is a presentation  evaluator,  it is organized  around the evaluation  form
(interested  matters  of the evaluator)
-(Weakness)  The composition  of the presentation  is not natural
+ Closing is the step of summarizing  the key content.  It is good to express  feelings  or use quotes to deliver  a
message  that will leave a deep impression,  but you should not bring up new stories.
B) Presentation  scenario  creation
@ Logic development  suitable  for purpose,  target audience,  and place
Depending  on the purpose,  subject, audience,  and location  of the presentation,  use techniques  for developing
logic, such as placing  the key message  first or last. If the purpose  of the presentation  is to present  a solution
or if the target audience  is a high-ranking  person, telling the key message  first is preferable.  By presenting  the
conclusion  quickly, it has the advantage  of inducing  interest  and retaining  the audience's  attention.  On the
other hand, when a dramatic  story development  is necessary  or when the audience  is the subject of training,
conveying  the key message  later is desirable.  It has the advantage  of being able to slowly build a connection
with the audience  and make the conclusion  fully understandable.
@ Structure  table of contents
Once the logic development  method has been decided,  build a table of contents  to maintain  the flow. First
create first-level  heading  and then detailed  subsections.
© Check the logic flow
Check the logic flow based on the prepared  table of contents.  While simulating  the presentation,  check
whether  there is any disturbance  in the flow.
@ Define conclusion
Summarize  the contents  of the presentation  and organize  arguments  or suggestions  to be presented as the
final conclusion.  It is important  to define it so that the audience  can relate to the natural flow of the log...
