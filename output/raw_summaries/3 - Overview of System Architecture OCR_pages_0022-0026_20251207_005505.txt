# System Architecture: Learning Guide (Pages 22-26)

## 1. Introduction to System Architecture

### 1.1 Why Study System Architecture?
*   Computer systems are integral to daily life (smartphones, services).
*   Understanding **system architecture** is crucial for comprehending how computer systems operate and how to secure them (e.g., against hardware hacking threats).

## 2. Concept of System Architecture

### 2.1 What is an Information System?
*   A system that uses **Information Technology (IT)**.
*   Provides services using computers, which operate with a combination of **hardware** and **software**.
*   Requires designing and building IT infrastructure (hardware and software).

### 2.2 Understanding System Architecture Definitions

**A) Broad Definition:**
*   Refers to all architecture needed for a system to provide services.
*   Encompasses:
    *   **Application Architecture (AA):** Designs software components, their connections, operations, and constraints.
    *   **Data Architecture (DA):** Defines data structures to ensure data integrity.
    *   **Technical Architecture (TA):** Designs hardware and middleware structures.

**B) Narrow Definition:**
*   Refers specifically to the document defining the configuration and relationships of:
    *   **Hardware:** Servers, storage, network, security.
    *   **Specific Software:** Operating Systems (OS), middleware.
*   Essentially, it focuses on the **Technical Architecture (TA)**, detailing how hardware and middleware components are laid out and connected.

**C) INCOSE Definition (International Council on Systems Engineering):**
*   "The fundamental and unifying system structure defined in terms of system elements, interfaces, processes, constraints, and behaviors."

### 2.3 Detailed Architecture Types (Under Narrow/Technical Architecture)

These define the specific structure and resources:

*   **Server Design Architecture:**
    *   Defines server resources: CPU speed/cores, memory capacity, network card (NIC) performance/count, storage types (SSD, SAS disk) and capacity.
    *   Specifies server types (rack-mount, blade) and sizes (1U to 4U).
*   **Network Design Architecture:**
    *   Defines network components for services: External network capacity (bandwidth).
    *   Determines connected switches and routers.
    *   Includes **L4 switches** for load balancing (distributing network traffic).
    *   Details security systems (DDoS, IPS, firewalls).
    *   Specifies network addresses (Subnet, IP, gateway).
*   **Storage Design Architecture:**
    *   Defines separate network storage: Capacity and performance (IOPS, bandwidth).
    *   Specifies media types (SSD, SAS, SATA).
    *   Details **RAID configurations** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks for data redundancy/performance).
    *   Specifies storage network types (SAN, iSCSI, NFS).

## 3. Core Information System Components

Information systems are built from four fundamental components: **Server, Storage, Network, and Security.**

### 3.1 Server
*   **Function:** Provides the computing power for an information system. Runs application programs to process business logic and data.
*   **Components:** Stacked structure of computer hardware, OS, middleware, and application programs.
*   **Design:** System architecture defines server capacity, count, layout, and role.
*   **Common Types:** Mainframes, Unix servers, x86 servers (increasingly popular, especially with cloud services).
*   **Example (Web Services):**
    *   **Webserver:** Responds to user requests, organizes web pages (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
    *   **Web Application Server (WAS):** Processes business logic, interacts with database servers (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss).
    *   **Database Server:** Manages data (creates, requests, modifies, deletes) (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### 3.2 Network
*   **Function:** Connects all information system components for communication. Processes communication between servers, servers and storage, and internal/external networks.
*   **Devices:**
    *   **Switches:** Connect devices within a local network (LAN).
    *   **Routers:** Connect different networks and direct traffic between them (e.g., LAN to Internet).
    *   **Load Balancers (L4/L7):** Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
    *   **Bridges:** Connect network segments.
    *   **Access Points (AP):** Used in wireless networks.
*   **Security Overlap:** The network is a common entry point for attacks, so security devices protect internal networks from external threats.

### 3.3 Storage
*   **Function:** Holds the data of an information system.

**A) Categorization by Data Storage Method:**
*   **Block Storage:** Saves data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 16KB). Used for Operating Systems (OS) like Windows, Linux, Unix.
*   **File Storage:** Saves data in file units. **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**, used for shared file repositories, is a common type.
*   **Object Storage:** Saves data as flexible objects, not fixed blocks or files. Mostly used in cloud storage.

**B) Categorization by Connection Method:**
*   **Direct Attached Storage (DAS):**
    *   Directly connected to a single server.
    *   Requires a filesystem to be usable.
    *   Examples: IDE, SATA, SAS drives within a server.
*   **Network Attached Storage (NAS):**
    *   Connected via a standard network (e.g., Ethernet).
    *   Mounted to the OS as a shared folder.
    *   Examples: NFS, CIFS, AFS protocols.
*   **Storage Area Network (SAN):**
    *   Connected via a dedicated, high-speed network specifically for storage (often Fibre Channel or iSCSI).
    *   Provides block-level access to storage, appearing as local disks to the OS, but requires creating a filesystem.
    *   Examples: SAN, iSCSI, FCoE.

### 3.4 Security
*   **Function:** Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information system. Typically configured via network connections.
*   **Placement:** Security hardware is installed between external (Internet) and internal networks, and often within the internal network itself.
*   **Key Security Devices/Systems:**
    *   **DDoS Defense System:** Protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
    *   **Firewalls:** Monitor, log, and block network traffic based on predefined rules.
    *   **IPS/IDS (Intrusion Prevention/Detection System):** Detects and/or prevents abnormal traffic or abuse.
    *   **Web Firewalls:** Specifically protect webservers by monitoring and blocking malicious web service traffic.
    *   **Access Control Solutions:** Manage user and system permissions, allowing or denying access to servers and resources.

"Discovery  of a ‘Chinese  hacking  chip’ in a well-known  server  board in the United
States...Industry  thrown  into commotion”  2018. 10. 05.
Citing the words of six senior US intelligence  officials on the 4th (local time), Bloomberg  reported  that a
hacking  microchip,  that was not in the design, was found on the server mainboard  of a well-known  server
manufacturer,  Super micro, and that the Chinese  Government  was allegedly  involved.
(Source: http://it.chosun.com/site/data/htm|_dir/2018/10/05/2018100502710.html)
There is not a moment  in our daily lives when we do not use the services  provided  by computer  systems.
With the wide-spread  use of smartphones,  we are spending  even more time with computer  systems.  In
such an environment,  Chinese  hacking  chips can expose  our lives to hackers.  This hacking  chip was found on a
computer  system’s  board. It contains  stolen key US information  through  hardware  hacking,  which is more
threatening  than software  hacking.  This tiny chip has the capability  to steal information  from a computer
over a network. How can such a small chip contain this function?  While the early computer,  ENIAC, was
the size of a building,  computers  have become  drastically  smaller since then, and the computing  power
of smartphones  that we carry in our hand is so high, that it is not even comparable  to that of ENIAC. It is
necessary  to learn the system  architecture  to understand  the concept  of a computer  system.

01 Concept  of System  Architecture
A) Understanding  system  architecture
@ Overview  of system  architecture
An information  system is a system that uses information  technology  (IT). The information  system provides  services
using a computer,  and a computer  operates  with a combination  of hardware  and software.  Implementing  an
information  system used inside an enterprise,  or provided  as a service  to users, requires  the design and construction
of IT infrastructures,  such as hardware  and software  design and development.  Software  designs the software
components  and operations,  such as the connection  of the software  components  and constraints  based on software
architecture.  Hardware,  like software,  designs  and develops  the hardware  architecture.  System architecture  refers
to the architecture  for a system to provide services,  based on hardware  and software  architecture.  In a broader
definition,  it refers to all architecture,  including  the application  architecture  (AA), data architecture  (DA), and technical
architecture  (TA), for constructing  an information  system.  A narrow definition  refers to the document  that defines  the
configuration  and relationship  of hardware,  such as a server, storage,  network  and security,  and certain  software  parts,
such as OS and middleware.
@ Definition  of system  architecture

Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Broad definition  of system  architecture
A system architecture  is a document  that defines  the structure  of an information  system provided  to support  the
business  process  required  to achieve  the objective  of an enterprise.  A system architecture  is divided into TA, which
defines the structure  of hardware,  such as a server, network,  and security,  as well as the distributed  structure  of
middleware  operating  on the hardware,  DA, which defines  the data structure  to assure data integrity,  and AA, which
defines  the software  components  and the relationship  and constraints  of said defined  components.
+ Narrow  definition  of system  architecture
A system  architecture  refers to the structure  of an information  system,  which includes  principles  and guidelines  that
define the components,  such as hardware,  software,  security,  interactions,  and constraints.  In other words, it refers
to TA and defines  the layout and connection  mode of the middleware,  such as the DB server and WAS, to distribute
the application  programs  of the developed system and hardware,  such as a server, storage,  and network.  The
following  table shows the types of detailed  architecture  defined  in system  architecture.
Type Description
It defines  the server  resources.
- CPU clock speed and number  of cores
- Memory  capacity  and network  card (NIC) performance  and count
- Type and capacity  of storage  units, such as SSD and SAS disk
- Server  type, such as rack-mount  type and blade type
