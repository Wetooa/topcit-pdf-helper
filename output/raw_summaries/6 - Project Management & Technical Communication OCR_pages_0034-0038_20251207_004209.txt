## Project Management & Technical Communication Learning Guide

This guide covers key principles for effective project documentation, one-page reports, and official letters.

---

### **Part 1: Effective Project Planning & Reporting**

#### **1. The 5W2HIT Framework (Project Planning)**
A structured approach to project planning:
*   **Why:** Reason, significance, background of the project.
*   **What:** Content of the plan, what will be done.
*   **Target:** Goals, subject, or audience of the project.
*   **How:** Method and means of promotion/execution.
*   **When:** Schedule and timeframe for implementation.
*   **Who:** Executioner(s) or responsible parties.
*   **Where:** Target area or location of performance.
*   **How Much:** Costs, benefits, budget, and profit plan.

#### **2. Principles of Concise Reporting**
*   **Keywords:** Summarize content using keywords; remove elaborate words.
*   **Conciseness:** Get straight to the point. Example:
    *   *Instead of:* "It's a very wonderful and beautiful night."
    *   *Use:* "Beautiful night."
    *   *Instead of:* "Company XX spent a lot of money and did not achieve what it wanted..."
    *   *Use:* "Company XX failed to achieve goals despite excessive spending."
*   **Clarify Conclusions:**
    *   State your thesis and conclusions clearly.
    *   Always answer: "How are you going to do it?" for managers/stakeholders.
*   **Use Tables Effectively:** Tables help summarize large amounts of information on a single page, complementing narrative sentences.

#### **3. Writing Report Titles**
A good title allows immediate understanding of the report's content, purpose, and nature.
*   **Identify Content:** Title should instantly convey the document's subject.
*   **Conciseness:** Aim for titles under 20 characters for quick grasp.
*   **Keywords:** Use specific words to indicate the document's nature (e.g., "review," "improvement proposal," "status," "minutes").
*   **Subtitles:** Use punctuation (-, ()) for more specific details if the main title is long.

**Examples:**
*   **Well-written:**
    *   "2009 Evaluation System Improvement Plan (Focusing on Performance Evaluation)"
    *   "Status of EA Introduction by High Performing Companies"
    *   "Minutes of ERP Introduction Meeting (1st)"
*   **Poorly written:**
    *   "Evaluation/Compensation System Improvement Plan"
    *   "Department Meeting Minutes"
    *   "EA introduction status"

#### **4. Report Logistics**
*   **Date and Organizer (Author):**
    *   **Location:** Indicate at the bottom right of the title.
    *   **Importance:** Provides a basis for document identification and prevents version confusion.
*   **Numbering:**
    *   **Organizational Standard:** Prioritize any specific numbering method set by your organization.
    *   **Common Methods:** If no standard, use common systems.
    *   **General Reports:** Often use numbers for main headings and figures (letters, Roman numerals, etc.) for subheadings.
    *   **Regulations/Policies:** May use code formulas (e.g., <Type 1>).
    *   **Official Letters/Poems:** May use mixed numbers and letters.

    **Common Numbering Examples:**
    *   **Type A:**
        1.  Main Heading
            a. Subheading
                i. Sub-subheading
    *   **Type B:**
        1.  Main Heading
            1.1 Subheading
                1.1.1 Sub-subheading

#### **5. Detailed Writing Method for One-Page Reports (By Item)**
Follow this structure for comprehensive one-page reports:

*   **Purpose:**
    *   One to two sentences explaining *why* the work is done or *why* the proposal is made.
*   **Status/Issue:**
    *   Describe the current situation and identify the problem/cause.
    *   Crucial for improvement-focused plans.
*   **Improvement Plan:**
    *   Present solutions to the identified problems.
    *   **Tip:** Use tables to compare different plans (e.g., Plan 1 vs. Plan 2), detailing content, strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   Organize and describe the timeline and major milestones for each item of the plan.
*   **Attachment:**
    *   If attachments exist, list and number them (e.g., "1. Reward Recipient List (1 copy)").
*   **End:**
    *   Mark "End" to signify the document's completion.
    *   **Placement:**
        *   No attachment: Two spaces after the last letter of the document.
        *   Last part is a table: Bottom left of the table.
        *   With attachment: Two spaces after the last letter of the attachment.

**Example One-Page Report Structure (Content Types):**
*   **Title:** [e.g., Knowledge History Management System Establishment Plan]
*   **Reporting Department:** [e.g., Human Resources/e-Management Team]
*   **Related Department:** [e.g., Technology Strategy Team]
*   **Date:** [YY-MM-DD]
    1.  **Purpose:** (e.g., Maximize HR efficiency, support decision-making)
    2.  **Status/Issue:** (e.g., Insufficient knowledge history management, difficulty finding experts)
    3.  **System Construction Plan:**
        *   **Overview:** (e.g., Establish database integrating personal histories, skills, experiences)
        *   **Main Functions:** (Table: Classification, Content - e.g., Knowledge history management, Career/Skill analysis, Experience sharing, Career goal management)
    4.  **Establishment Process:** (e.g., Timeline of steps: Research, System Design, Development, Initiation, Establishment)
    5.  **Expected Benefit:** (Table: Classification, Content - e.g., Strengthening strategic support, Effective manpower utilization, Knowledge exchange/Business promotion support)
*   **End.**

### **Part 2: Official Letters**

#### **1. Definition & Types of Official Letters**
*   **Definition:** A formal document conveying an organization's intent in business settings, issued in the name of the organization's head.
*   **Draft Text:** A document created for approval by the head of the organization.
*   **Execution Text:** The approved draft text (with approval section removed) delivered to the recipient.

#### **2. Approval**
An official letter becomes effective upon signature of the approving authority.
*   **Signature Types:** Electronic image, electronic text, administrative electronic signatures.
*   **Definition of Approval:** The act of an authorized person making a decision.
*   **Types of Approval:**
    *   **Regular Approval:** Made by the head of the organization (e.g., CEO, Institution Head).
    *   **Discretionary Approval:** Approval authority delegated by the head to a sub-organization leader. Has the same effect as regular approval.
    *   **Substitute Approval:** Temporary delegation of approval authority to a subordinate when the primary approver is absent for an extended period.

#### **3. General Methods of Writing Official Letters**
These methods are often based on government regulations for formal documents.
*   **Numbers:**
    *   Use Arabic numerals by default.
    *   Currency/amounts: Use commas for thousands (e.g., 1,113,500 won).
    *   Years: No commas (e.g., 2023).
*   **Date:**
    *   Numbers only, omit "year," "month," "day."
    *   Separate units with dots (e.g., 2023.10.26).
*   **Time:**
    *   24-hour format.
    *   Omit "hour," "minute."
    *   Use a colon between hours and minutes (e.g., 17:30 for 5:30 PM).
*   **Subdivision:** Follow "Regulations on the Efficient Operation of Administrative Affairs" for clear drafting.

#### **4. Methods of Writing Official Letters by Item**
*   **Sender:**
    *   Write the name of the sending organization at the top center of the document (e.g., OOO Co., Ltd.).
*   **Recipient:**
    *   Write the head of the receiving organization (e.g., "Mayor of Seoul").
    *   For multiple recipients, write "Refer to the list of recipients" and list them separately (e.g., "Seoul Metropolitan City Mayor, Uiwang City Mayor, Gwangju Metropolitan City Mayor").
*   **Reference:**
    *   Indicate the organization responsible for handling the document (e.g., "Head of General Affairs Department").
    *   If unsure, write "the person in charge of OO."
*   **Title:**
    *   A concise title that encompasses the document's content, similar to one-page report title guidelines.
*   **Greeting:**
    *   Start the official letter with a greeting (e.g., "1. We wish all the best to your company.").
*   **Relevant Evidence:**
    *   Clearly state the grounds for sending the document.
    *   Usually includes document number, effective date, and document title (e.g., "Seoul Metropolitan City Public Notice No. 20XX-326 (20XX.11.30) 20XX Request for Recommendation...").
    *   Can be omitted if no relevant evidence.
*   **Content:**
    *   Begin with opening statements summarizing the core message.
    *   Follow with detailed items supporting the core content.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
* 5W2HIT
- Why: Why are you planning  this project?  (Reason,  significance,  background)
- What: What are you going to do with this project?  (Content  of the plan)
- Target: With what goals are you implementing  this project?  (Subject,  target of planning)
- How: How are you going to promote  this project?  (Method,  means)
- When: When and on what schedule?  (Time and period of implementation)
- Who: Who promotes  it? (Executioner,  person concerned)
- Where: Where do you perform  it? (Target  area, place)
- How much: What about the costs and benefits?  (Budget,  profit plan)
After that, the contents  naturally  described  according  to the table of contents  are summarized  focused  on
keywords.  A one-page  report is completed  by subtracting  elaborate  words and putting  only the keywords  in a
concise  and clear manner.
As in the example in the table below, the work of the organization  cannot be exaggerated  with flowery
language,  so it should be described  based on the fact itself, As shown in the example  below, just [Beautiful
Night] is enough  to convey  the meaning  of [It’s a very wonderful  and beautiful  night.]. Also, as in the example
below, if the phrase [spent a lot of money] can be substituted  with [excessive  spending],  to deliver the
meaning  more clearly.
<Table 4> Example  of Removing  Unnecessary  Words
General Sentence Sentence  for reporting
It’s a very wonderful  and beautiful  night. Beautiful  night, or night
Company  XX spent a lot of money  and did not achieve Company  XX failed to achieve  its goals despite  excessive
what it wanted  as a result of the project  implementation. spending
© Clarify  the conclusion
While most of the poorly written reports have a description  of current status and analysis,  they are often
not clear what they want to assert or what conclusions  they want to draw.  It is very important  to clarify the
thesis and draw conclusions  in order to make a one-page  report. In particular,  there should be an answer  to the
question  of “How are you going to do it?” asked by a manager  or a stakeholder.
@ Effective  Use of Tables
Since summarization  is important  for a one-page  report, narration  alone is not enough. Therefore,  proper use
of narrative  sentences  and tables help to summarize  and describe  a large amount  of content  on one page.
© Methods  of Writing  the Title of the Report
The title should be written in a way that the content  of the document  can be immediately  identified.  Especially
for busy managers  and executives,  it is very important  to write the title well so that the content  can be
immediately  grasped  just by looking  at the title. It is better to condense  the content  within 20 characters  so
that anyone  can identify  the whole content,  purpose,  and nature of the report even by reading  the title.
If you look at the examples  below, well-written  titles imply the year, the nature of the document,  etc., while
poorly written titles are not specific and ambiguous.  It is necessary  to describe  the title of the document  in a

ESSENCE
way that the character  of the document  can be immediately  understood  by using words like review, improvement
(proposal),  status, and minutes.  If the title seems to be too long, it is also effective  to add subtitles  using
punctuations  like -, (), etc. to describe  the content  more specifically.
+ Well-written  Report  Title (example)
2009 Evaluation  System  Improvement  Plan (Focusing  on Improvement  of Performance  Evaluation
System)
Status  of Introduction  of Enterprise  Architecture  (EA) by High Performing  Companies
Minutes  of related departments  for ERP introduction  (1st)
+ Poorly written Report Title (example)
Evaluation/Compensation  System Improvement  Plan
Department  Meeting  Minutes
EA (Enterprise  Architecture)  introduction  status
© Date and Organizer  (author)  of Report
The date and organizer  (author)  of a report should be indicated  at the right bottom of the title. This is
important  because  it provides  a basis for identifying  the document  later and prevents  confusion  with older
versions.  Beginners  often make the mistake  of omitting  this part.
@ Numbering
If you like or have decided  on any specific numbering  method, use it. Here, what is set by the organization
should be prioritized,  and if there is none, choose  what you use the most. The following  numbering  system is
used a lot for general  plans.
As shown in the example  below, two main numbering  methods  are used the most: using numbers  for headings
and figures for subheadings:  and numbering  with figures.
Code formulas  such as <Type 1> and <Type 2> are mainly used in documents  such as regulations  and policies,
and <Type 3> and <Type 4> of the mixed use of numbers  and letters are mainly used for official letters and
poems,
