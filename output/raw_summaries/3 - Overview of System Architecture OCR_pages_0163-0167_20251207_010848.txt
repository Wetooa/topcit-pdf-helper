### 2. Network Layer Encapsulation

*   **Encapsulation:** The process of adding a header (e.g., network layer header) to data at a transmitting layer segment (e.g., datalink layer). This configures packets for transmission.
*   **Decapsulation:** The reverse process at the receiving end, where headers are removed.

### 3. IPv4 Header Fields

The IPv4 header contains important information for routing and packet handling:

*   **Version:** The IP protocol version (e.g., 4 for IPv4).
*   **IHL (Internet Header Length):** The length of the IP header.
*   **Type of Service:** Specifies the desired service type for the packet in the subnet.
*   **Total Length:** The sum of the header and data lengths in the datagram.
*   **Time to Live (TTL):** A limit on the packet's lifespan, preventing infinite loops.
*   **Protocol:** Indicates the higher-layer protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) for datagram recombination.
*   **Source Address:** The 32-bit IP address of the sender.
*   **Destination Address:** The 32-bit IP address of the recipient.

### 4. Packet Switching Approaches

Methods for finding a packet's path in a network:

*   **Datagram Approach (Connectionless):**
    *   Each packet is processed independently.
    *   Packets can be transferred via different paths.
    *   The destination address determines the forwarding path for each packet.
*   **Virtual Circuit Approach (Connection-oriented):**
    *   Establishes a virtual path for datagrams *before* transfer.
    *   All datagrams for that connection follow the same path.
    *   The forwarding path is determined by a packet label (virtual circuit identifier).

### 5. Network Layer Protocols

Key protocols operating at the network layer:

*   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) (RFC 826):** Converts an IP address into a MAC (Media Access Control) address.
*   **RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) (RFC 903):** Converts a MAC address into an IP address.
*   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) (RFC 792):** Used to transfer network error information (e.g., destination unreachable).
*   **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) (RFC 1112):** Used for IP multicasting (sending data to a group of recipients).

### 6. Network Layer Commands

Common commands to check network status or perform actions:

*   **Ping:**
    *   Uses ICMP messages (echo request/reply) to test network layer connectivity to a host.
*   **Tracert / Traceroute:**
    *   Finds the path (route) to a desired destination.
    *   Helps identify network sections causing bottlenecks.
*   **Route:**
    *   Allows manual modification of the routing table.
*   **Ipconfig / Ifconfig:**
    *   Checks a computer's TCP/IP network settings.
    *   Used to check and update DHCP and DNS settings.
*   **Netstat:**
    *   Checks network connections, routing table, and network interface status.
*   **Arp:**
    *   Shows or allows changes to the local ARP cache (mappings of IP to MAC addresses).

### 7. Network Service Quality (QoS)

**A) QoS Characteristics (Measurements)**
QoS ensures service quality and performance. Key attributes include:

*   **Confidence:** The ability to safely deliver a packet to its destination.
*   **Delay:** The time taken to transmit a packet from sender to receiver.
*   **Jitter:** The variation in delay for packets belonging to the same data flow.
*   **Bandwidth:** The maximum data transfer rate available for communication.

**B) QoS Implementation Techniques**

1.  **Scheduling:** Routers manage packet flow based on different scheduling methods:
    *   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Queuing:** Packets are delivered in the order they arrive (basic Internet method).
    *   **Priority Queuing:** Packets are assigned priorities; higher priority packets are handled first.
    *   **Weighted Fair Queuing:** Packets are assigned to priority queues, and queues are selected in a round-robin manner. The number of packets delivered from each queue varies by its assigned "weight."

2.  **Traffic Shaping & Traffic Policing:**
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Controls traffic speed and volume as traffic *leaves* the network.
    *   **Traffic Policing:** Controls traffic speed and volume as traffic *enters* the network.
    *   **Leaky Bucket:** Stores burst input packets and outputs them at an average, consistent rate. Packets may be discarded if the input exceeds the bucket's capacity.
    *   **Token Bucket:** A common algorithm used for both traffic shaping and policing.

3.  **Resource Reservation:**
    *   Method of reserving network resources (e.g., buffer space, bandwidth, CPU time) for specific data flows to guarantee service quality.

4.  **Admission Control:**
    *   A procedure used by a communication network's control unit to decide whether to accept a new connection request, based on available resources and QoS policies.

**C) Service Quality Models and Protocols**

*   **Integrated Service (IntServ) Model:**
    *   A flow-based QoS model.
    *   Explicitly reserves resources (like bandwidth) for specific data flows.
*   **Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) (RFC 2110):**
    *   A protocol standardized to reserve and secure bandwidth needed by applications between endpoints. Often used with IntServ.
*   **Differentiated Service (DiffServ) Model:**
    *   A class-based QoS model.
    *   Specifies the required service type for each packet transmission, operating based on packet priority.

### 8. Routing Protocol Algorithm and Type

**A) What is a Routing Protocol?**
*   Defines messages, exchange procedures, and actions for routers to efficiently set and update routing tables.

**B) What is a Routing Algorithm?**
*   Finds the "low-cost" path between a source and destination router in a network.
*   "Low-cost" refers to the path with the minimum sum of link costs among all possible paths.

**C) Routing Algorithm Types**

*   **Link State Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Each router calculates the low-cost path to all destinations.
    *   Uses the *entire network's* configuration and link-state information.
*   **Distance Vector Routing Algorithm:**
    *   Each router maintains a low-cost path table (vector) to all destination routers.
    *   Initially, only direct connections' cost data is known.
    *   Routers share their path cost data with neighboring routers.

A) Network  layer encapsulation
As shown in [Figure 117], the packets  on the network  layer are configured  by adding a header  to the transmitting
layer segment.  This process  is called encapsulation  of the datalink  layer, and the process  is reversed  on the receiving
end and is called decapsulation.

In [Figure 118] above, “Version”  refers to the protocol  version  of the datagram,  “IHL” refers to the header  length, and
“Type of Service” refers to which type of service the host wants in the subnet. “Total length” refers to the sum of
the header and data lengths in the datagram,  “Time to Live” refers to the packet life limit, and “Protocol’ refers to
the notification  of TCP or UDP for the recombination  of the datagram  on the network  layer. “Source  Address”  and
“Destination  Address’  refer to the source and destination  addresses  of the 32-bit datagram.
03 Packet  Switching  and Network  Layer Protocol/Instruction
A) Packet  switching
The methods  of finding the packet path in a packet-exchanging  network,  include the datagram  approach  and the
virtual circuit approach.  The datagram  approach  is a non-connected  service  that independently  processes  all packets.
Packets  can be transferred  through  different  paths, and the packet’s  destination  address  determines  the forwarding
path. The virtual circuit approach  is a connection-oriented  service. It establishes  a virtual path for the datagram
before the transfer,  and all datagrams  are transmitted  to the same path after the connection.  The forwarding  path is
determined  by the packet  label (virtual circuit identifier).
B) Network  layer protocol/command
The network  layer protocols that convert  the IP and MAC addressesinto  an IP address,  are the ARP (Address
Resolution  Protocol)  and the RARP (Reverse  Address  Resolution  Protocol).  ICMP (Internet  Control Message  Protocol)
is a protocol  used to transfer  the network  error information, and IGMP (Internet  Group Management  Protocol)  is the
protocol  for IP multicast  transfer.
