## Database Learning Guide: ER & EER Models

### 1. Extended ER (EER) Model Concepts

The EER model enhances the basic ER model with additional concepts:

*   **Composite Attribute:** An attribute that can be broken down into smaller, meaningful parts (e.g., "Address" into "Street," "City," "Zip Code").
*   **Generalization/Specialization:**
    *   **Generalization:** Combining multiple *sub-entity types* (sub-types) into a higher-level *super-entity type* (super-type).
    *   **Specialization:** Breaking down a *super-entity type* into multiple *sub-entity types*.
    *   These are inverse processes.
    *   **Relationship Type:** Called an **IS-A** relationship (e.g., "A Car IS-A Vehicle").
    *   **Inheritance:** Concepts like attributes and relationships can be inherited from the super-type by sub-types.
*   **Aggregation:**
    *   Defines a *new entity* using a collection of *multiple existing entities*.
    *   **Relationship Type:** Called an **IS-PART-OF** relationship (e.g., "A Line Item IS-PART-OF an Order").
    *   **Inheritance:** Does **not** apply to aggregation.

### 2. Crow's Foot ERD Notation (Industry Standard)

While Chen's notation is academic, Crow's Foot is widely used in industry.

#### A. Entity, Attribute, Identifier Representation

*   **Entity Name:** Written *outside* the top of the rectangle.
*   **Attribute Names:** Written *inside* the rectangle.
*   **Identifier (Primary Key - PK):** Listed in the *top section* of the rectangle, separated from general attributes.
*   **General Attributes:** Listed in the *bottom section*.

**Example:**
```
+-------------+
|   Student   |
+-------------+
| Student ID (PK)
| Name
| Address
| Contact Info
| Grade
+-------------+
```

#### B. Characteristics of an Entity

An entity must:

*   Represent information relevant to the work and needing management.
*   Be uniquely identifiable by an identifier.
*   Represent a set of *two or more* permanent instances (not just one).
*   Be used by a work process.
*   Have at least one attribute.
*   Have at least one relationship with another entity.

#### C. Classification of Entities

Entities can be classified:

*   **By Tangible/Intangible Type:**
    *   **Tangible Entity:** Something physical (e.g., Employee, Article).
    *   **Concept Entity:** An abstract idea (e.g., Organization, Place, Department).
    *   **Event Entity:** Occurrences or transactions (e.g., Reception, Contract, Order, Progress).
*   **By Time of Occurrence:**
    *   **Fundamental/Key Entity:** Core entities.
    *   **Main Entity:** Central to a process.
    *   **Active Entity:** Dynamic, often event-driven.

#### D. Classification of Attributes

Attributes are categorized by their origin:

*   **Basic Attribute:** Directly defined from business analysis (e.g., Product Name, Manufacturing Date).
*   **Designed Attribute:** Identified during design, often a 1:1 substitute for a basic attribute for specific purposes (e.g., Drug Container Code from Container ID).
*   **Derived Attribute:** Calculated or transformed from other attributes (e.g., Total Number of Containers, Manufacturing Cost).

#### E. Relationship Notation (Crow's Foot)

Crow's Foot clearly marks different relationship types:

*   **Identifying Relationship:** The child entity inherits the parent's primary key as *part of its own primary key*.
*   **Non-Identifying Relationship:** The child entity inherits the parent's primary key as a *non-key attribute* (foreign key).
*   **Required Relationship:** Denoted by a straight line, meaning participation is mandatory.
*   **Optional Relationship:** Denoted by a circle on the line, meaning participation is optional.

**Cardinality Symbols:**

| Cardinality   | Notation on Relationship Line | Description                                 |
| :------------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **1:1 (Required)** | `-----|------|-----`       | Exactly one on each side. Both mandatory.   |
| **1:1 (Optional)** | `-----O------O-----`      | Zero or one on each side. Both optional.    |
| **1:N (Required)** | `-----|------<-----`      | One on the left, one or more on the right.  |
| **1:N (Optional)** | `-----O------<-----`      | Zero or one on the left, one or more on the right. |
| **0 or 1**    | `O` (Circle on line)          | The entity at this end can have zero or one. |
| **Exactly 1** | `|` (Straight line)           | The entity at this end must have exactly one. |
| **0 to Many** | `<` (Crow's Foot & Circle)  | The entity at this end can have zero or many. |
| **1 to Many** | `<` (Crow's Foot & Line)    | The entity at this end must have at least one, and can have many. |

#### F. How to Read Relationships

Read relationships from the source entity to the target entity, describing participation and options:

*   **"Each/One [Source Entity] [Relationship Option (always/sometimes)] [Relationship Name] [Number of Target Entities (one/several)] [Target Entity]."**

**Example:**
*   "Each Employee *always belongs to* one Department." (Required, 1:1)
*   "Each Employee *sometimes belongs to* several Teams." (Optional, 1:N)

### 3. Identifiers

An identifier uniquely distinguishes instances within an entity.

#### A. Characteristics of a Primary Identifier

A primary identifier must have:

*   **Uniqueness:** Every instance within the entity must have a distinct value (e.g., Employee Number).
*   **Minimality:** It should consist of the fewest possible attributes while maintaining uniqueness.
*   **Invariability:** Its value should ideally not change once assigned to an instance.
*   **Presence (Non-Null):** It must always have a value; it cannot be null (empty).

#### B. Classification of Identifiers

Identifiers can be classified by various aspects:

*   **By Representativeness:**
    *   **Primary Identifier:** Uniquely identifies instances *and* can link to other entities (acts as a Foreign Key).
    *   **Alternate Identifier:** Uniquely identifies instances *but cannot* link to other entities effectively.
*   **By Generation Source:**
    *   **Internal (Self-Generated) Identifier:** Created within the entity itself.
    *   **Foreign Identifier:** Received from another entity through a relationship.
*   **By Number of Attributes:**
    *   **Single Identifier:** Composed of one attribute.
    *   **Composite Identifier:** Composed of two or more attributes.
*   **By Creation Status:**
    *   **Natural Identifier:** An identifier that naturally arises from the business process (e.g., Order Number).
    *   **Artificial Identifier:** An identifier created specifically for system use when a natural identifier is complex or unsuitable (e.g., a system-generated `Employee_PK`).

#### C. Identifier Relationship vs. Non-Identifier Relationship

*   A **foreign identifier** is an attribute in a child entity that originates from the primary identifier of a parent entity through a relationship. It becomes a **foreign key** in the database.
*   When a child entity receives a foreign identifier from a parent:
    *   **Identifying Relationship:** The child entity uses the received foreign identifier as *part of its own primary identifier*. This makes the child entity existentially dependent on the parent.
    *   **Non-Identifying Relationship:** The child entity includes the received foreign identifier as a *regular attribute* (a foreign key), but it does not become part of the child's primary identifier. The child entity can exist independently of the parent's primary key.

© Composite  attribute
A composite  attribute  refers to an attribute  that can be decomposed  into two or more elements,  and is distinguished
from general  attributes  (simple  attribute)  by displaying  the links between  the attributes.
05 Extended  ER (EER: Extended  Entity-Relationship)  Model
The EER model adds several  useful concepts  to the basic ER model.
A) Generalization/Specialization
@ Generalization:  Separation  of one entity type (super  type) into multiple  sub-level  entity types (sub-type).
@ Specialization:  Integration  of multiple  entity types (sub type) into one upper-level  entity type (super-type).
© Generalization  and specialization  have an inverse relationship.  The generalization/specialization  relationship  is called
the IS-A relationship.
@ The concept  of inheritance  applies.
Specialization
Generalization
B) Aggregation
@ Aggregation  defines  a new entity with a set of multiple  entities.  It is called an IS-PART-OF  relationship.
@ The concept  of inheritance  does not apply.

06 Another  Type of ERD Notation:  The Crow’s  Foot Model
Chen's ERD (described  above) is mainly used in the academic  world, whereas  information  engineering  notation,  also
known as Crow’s Foot notation,  is mainly used in industry.
A) Entity, attribute,  identifier
© Specify  the entity name outside  the rectangle.
@ Specify  the attribute  name inside the rectangle.
© The rectangle  is divided into top/bottom.  Specify  the identifier  attribute  at the top and the general attributes  at the
bottom.

B) Characteristics  of the entity
@ Information  must be required  by the work concerned  and should be the information  to be managed. (Example:
Patient,  number  of times TOEIC exams are taken, etc.)
@ An entity should be identifiable  by a unique identifier.
@ Anentity  should be a set of instances  that exist permanently.
(Not “one”, but “two or more’)
@ Anentity  should be used by the work process.
© Anentity  must have an attribute.
© An entity should have at least one relationship  with other entities.
C) Classification  of entities
@ Classification  by tangible  and intangible  type - Generally,  entities  can be classified  into tangible  entities,  concept
entities, and event entities  depending  on whether  they are tangible  or intangible.
Classification  by the time of occurrence  - Entities can be classified  into fundamental  entities/key  entities, main
entities, and active entities  depending  on the time of occurrence.

Attributes  can be classified  into the basic attribute  which is directly  defined by analyzing  the work, the designed
attribute  which is identified  during design even though it does not exist in work, and the derived attribute which is
calculated  or transformed  from other attributes.

F) How to read relationships
To read a data model, the identifier reads one or each source entity participating  in the relationship,  followed  by the
number  of target entities  (one, more than one), relationship  options,  and relationship  names.
+ The identifier  reads one or each source entity.
+ The identifier reads the degree of the target entity's participation  in relationships,  that is, the number  (one, more
than one).
+ The identifier  reads the relationship  option and the relationship  name.
