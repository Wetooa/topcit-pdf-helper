## IT Business Strategy & Environment Analysis: Learning Guide

This guide covers the core concepts of establishing an IT business strategy and analyzing its environment.

### 1. Overview of IT Business Strategy Phases

An IT business strategy involves two main phases:
1.  **Strategy Establishment:** Defining the strategy itself.
2.  **Environment Analysis:** Understanding the context.

**Key Analysis Techniques:**
*   **External Environment:**
    *   **Macro-environment:** PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technical)
    *   **Micro-environment:** 5-Force industry structure, 4P/3C marketing analysis
*   **Internal Environment:** McKinsey 7S Method
*   **Consolidated Environment:** SWOT Analysis, BCG Matrix

### 2. Establishing an IT Business Strategy

The IT business environment constantly changes, so IT strategies must be continuously updated. The goal is to align the organization and its business with the environment to increase survival chances and achieve targets.

#### A) Concept of Strategy Establishment

*   **Definition:** The process of defining strategies to fulfill an organization's mission.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Explains current status and suggests directions for change.
    *   Ensures alignment with strategies of individual business units.
    *   Provides direction for company-wide activities (e.g., Enterprise Architecture, risk management).
*   **Output:** A Strategic Plan document.
*   **Hierarchy:** Corporate strategy cascades down to mid-level and operational goals.

#### B) Elements of a Strategy Plan

Strategy development typically involves evaluating the **current (As-Is) model**, setting **future goals (To-Be model)**, and formulating **implementation strategies** to bridge the gap.

| Element               | Description                                                               |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mission**           | The organization's core purpose or main business; not time-bound.         |
| **Vision**            | The ideal future the company aspires to; achieved by executing the mission. |
| **Goals**             | Measurable, high-level targets that support the mission.                  |
| **Objectives**        | Specific, quantifiable, low-level targets indicating goal achievement.      |
| **Principles**        | Core values or constraints guiding how targets are achieved.               |
| **Enablers**          | External environments or internal strengths that help achieve goals.      |
| **Barriers**          | External environments or internal weaknesses that hinder goal achievement. |
| **Strategy**          | The approach taken to achieve the mission, objectives, and goals.           |
| **Strategic Plan**    | A document outlining the strategy and factors influencing it.              |
| **Initiatives**       | Sets of activities performed to implement a strategy.                       |
| **Actions**           | Specific, time-constrained procedures to achieve objectives, assigned to people. |
| **Performance Index** | The target value used to measure progress toward a goal.                   |

#### C) Strategy Setting Process

The strategy setting process is cyclical and involves four phases:

1.  **Strategy Analysis**
2.  **Strategy Selection**
3.  **Strategy Implementation & Management**
4.  **Feedback** (leading back to Analysis for review)

##### 1. Strategy Analysis

*   **Purpose:** Collect information needed for business decisions.
*   **Key Distinction:**
    *   **Internal Environment:** Can be controlled and improved by the company.
    *   **External Environment:** Difficult to control, requiring adaptive strategies.

    **Components of Strategy Analysis:**
    *   **External Environment Analysis:**
        *   **Macro-environment:** Broad factors like political, economic, social, technological. (PEST analysis is used here).
        *   **Micro-environment:** Industry-specific competitive environment where the company acquires resources and sells products/services.
    *   **Internal Environment Analysis:** Focuses on a company's internal elements, processes, resources, organization, and internal changes.
    *   **Consolidated Environment Analysis:**
        *   A comprehensive look at both external and internal factors together.
        *   **SWOT Analysis:** A key tool that examines:
            *   **S**trengths & **W**eaknesses (internal factors)
            *   **O**pportunities & **T**hreats (external factors)

##### 2. Strategy Selection

*   **Purpose:** Choose the best future direction for the company based on the analysis results.
*   **Critical Point:** Flawed analysis leads to poor strategy selection. A thorough review of analysis results is essential.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Generate a list of alternative strategic directions.
    2.  Evaluate each alternative against established standards (considering resource needs and solutions to key issues).
    3.  Select the most appropriate alternative as the strategic direction.

##### 3. Strategy Implementation & Management

*   **Action:** Adopt and put the chosen strategic alternative into effect.
*   **Key Managerial Issues:**
    *   Resource viability for execution.
    *   Readiness of company culture and structure.
    *   Change management for strategy realization.
    *   Strategy realization path and development method.
    *   Steering group readiness within the company.
    *   Influence over internal/external stakeholders.
*   **Monitoring & Adaptation:**
    *   Continuously monitor strategy progress.
    *   Provide feedback from implementation back to the analysis phase.
    *   Be prepared for unexpected events: internal/external environments can change, requiring a review of the strategy analysis to ensure continued validity.

### 3. IT Business Environment Analysis

#### A) External Environment Analysis

##### 1. PEST Analysis

*   **Purpose:** Analyzes the external **macro-environment** by identifying Political, Economic, Social, and Technological (PEST) opportunity and threat factors.
*   **Method:** Brainstorm characteristics of the target market (country/region) across these four dimensions.

01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
The IT business  strategy  phase is divided into two parts: establishment  of the IT business  strategy  and analysis of
the IT business  environment.  In the first part, the general concept  of establishing  a strategy  is explained,  along with
he elements  that make up a strategy  and the process  involved  in establishing  a strategy.
n the second part, methods  of analyzing  the external and internal environments  are conducted  followed by an
analysis  the consolidated  environment  that considers  the external  and internal  environments  together.
For the analysis  of the external  environment,  the PEST technique  is employed  to analyze  the macro-external
environment  from the political, economic  social and technical  perspectives.  An explanation  is given of the 5-Force
industry  structure  analysis  technique  (ie. analysis  of the competitive  advantage  provided by IT business  through 5
‘actors including  the supplier  and buyer's negotiating  power, level of competition,  etc.), which is used to analyze the
micro-external  environment.  This is followed  by an explanation  of the4P and 3C techniques  used in marketing  and
competitive  market  analysis.
For the analysis of the internal environment, the McKinsey  7S Method is introduced.  This technique  uses 7
‘actors starting  with the letter S (shared values, strategy,  system, etc.) to analyze the internal environment.  In
the consolidated  environment  analysis,  the SWOT analysis  technique  is explained  as a method  of simultaneously
analyzing  the external  market  environment  and internal factors. SWOT analysis  is explained  in conjunction  with the
BCG matrix, which is a technique  for selecting  a business  development  strategy  by looking at the growth potential
and market  share of an IT business.
O2 Establishment  of an IT Business  Strategy
As the IT business  environment  is changing  and evolving  continuously,  the targets of an IT business  strategy  must
also be updated  continuously  if a company  is to meet the objectives  of its IT business.  In addition,  the goal of the
IT business  strategy  is to fine-tune  the organization  and its business  to the environment,  thereby increasing  the
likelihood  of the organization's  survival as well as increasing  its chances  of achieving  its business  targets.
A) The concept  of strategy  establishment
“Strategy  establishment’  is the process  of defining  strategies  for fulfilling  an organization's  mission.  Corporate
strategies  must incorporate  explanations  and analyses  of the current status of a given company  and suggest
direction(s)  for change. The formulated  strategies  should be directly aligned with the strategies  of each unit-
level organization.  The output of strategic  planning  is a document  that describes  the top-level  strategy and the
environments  or aims of the organization  that could  have an impact  on the strategy.  A strategic  plan not only
provides  the basis for carrying  out the specific  action steps of the plan, but also provides  the overall direction  for the
enterprise  architecture  (EA), process  improvement,  risk management,  and portfolio  management,  and other types of
company-wide  activities.
The subordinate  goals and procedures  for realizing  a company’s  implementation  strategies  can be defined si as to
reflect issues that are pertinent  to each level of the organization's  hierarchy.  For instance,  if the business manager

establishes  mid-level  strategies  and goals based on the corporate  strategy,  the production  staff can then use the
mid-level  strategies  to set their own goal sat their level.
B) The elements  of a strategy  plan
There are many different  approaches  to choose  from when developing  a strategy.  At a typical strategy  development
stage, the current conditions  of the subject company  are evaluated,  future goals are set, and implementation
strategies  for realizing  the company’s  target model are formulated.
