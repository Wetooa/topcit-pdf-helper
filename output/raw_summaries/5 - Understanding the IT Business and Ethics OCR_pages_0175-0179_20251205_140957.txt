# Learning Guide: Modern Tech & Professional Ethics

## Section 1: The Rise of Advanced Technology – Drones

Machines are advancing rapidly, capable of tasks beyond human limitations, such as analyzing vast data (medical, judicial) or supplementing human abilities (e.g., for the elderly).

### What is a Drone?
*   **Definition:** An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is aircraft or helicopter-shaped, controlled by radio signals.
*   **Origin:** First developed for military purposes, later reused as target aircraft in exercises.
*   **Modern Use:** Increasingly adopted in the private sector, especially when equipped with GPS or video devices.

### Advantages of Drones
*   **Access:** Can reach places impossible or hazardous for humans (e.g., deep oceans, areas with toxic gases or radioactivity).
*   **Autonomy:** Can operate independently, recognizing surroundings and flying without human input.
*   **Versatility:** Due to their unrestricted access, drones have diverse applications.

### Key Applications of Drones
*   **Distribution:**
    *   Amazon: Plans 30-minute deliveries within a 16km radius.
    *   Domino's Pizza: Successfully delivered two large pizzas.
*   **ICT (Information and Communication Technology):**
    *   Facebook: Developing drones that hover like Wi-Fi routers to provide internet access in remote areas.
*   **Disaster Relief:**
    *   'Global Hawk' drone: Used to gather data from inside the Fukushima nuclear reactor.
    *   'Global Hawk' drone: Aided recovery efforts after the Haiti earthquake and typhoon disasters in the Philippines.
*   **Crime Prevention:**
    *   Seattle Police: Use drones for tracking stolen vehicles and investigating drug-related crimes.
*   **Traffic Information:**
    *   Renault: Introduced a car with an integrated drone to gather traffic congestion and road obstacle information.

## Section 2: Understanding IT Business and Ethics

The rapid development of IT technology brings immense convenience and efficiency, creating user-centric services. However, this also increases the risks of misuse, abuse, and malicious use of advanced software. This highlights the growing importance of ethical responsibility in the IT sector.

### Why IT Ethics is Important
*   IT advancements create powerful tools, but also potential for harm.
*   Ensuring responsible use and development of IT is critical.

### Key Terms
*   **Professional Ethics:** A code of conduct for those in a specific job.
*   **Ethics:** Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.
*   **Work Ethics:** Ethical principles related to one's job performance and duties.
*   **Community Ethics:** Ethical principles governing interactions and responsibilities within a professional community or workplace.
*   **Ethics and Law:** The interplay between moral standards and legal regulations.

### Case Study Example: The Cost of Lacking Ethics
*   **Incident:** In 2018, individuals leaked design drawings and key technical data for a domestic company's high-efficiency washing machine motor to a Chinese company.
*   **Motive:** Financial gain (cash, housing, vehicles).
*   **Consequence:** Theft of intellectual property, undermining years of investment and innovation.
*   **Lesson:** This case exemplifies how a lack of professional ethics, even in advanced technological fields, can lead to severe consequences, despite sophisticated technology and systems. Professional ethics remains a fundamental, timeless requirement.

## Section 3: Professional Ethics Explained

### What is Professional Ethics?
*   **Definition:** A set of conduct rules that individuals in a specific job must follow during their work.
*   **Scope:** It defines appropriate mindsets, attitudes, behaviors towards one's job, and how professionals interact with others in their work environment.
*   **Normative Aspect:** Includes ethical norms to be observed, rules for common behavior, and boundaries to prevent unethical actions.

### Components of Professional Ethics

Professional ethics is typically divided into two main categories:

1.  **Work Ethics:** Focuses on an individual's attitude and behavior towards their tasks.
    *   **Diligence:** Maintaining a steady and hardworking attitude in your job.
    *   **Honesty:** Acting truthfully and openly, without deceiving or hiding information.
    *   **Sincerity:** Handling tasks with dedication and wholehearted effort.
    *   **Spirit of Service:** Working hard for the benefit of the country, company, or others, rather than just personal gain.

2.  **Community Ethics:** Focuses on an individual's responsibilities and interactions within their professional community and society.
    *   **Responsibility:** Having the attitude to complete assigned tasks or commitments.
    *   **Compliance:** Obeying and following established workplace rules, policies, and norms.
    *   **Workplace Etiquette:** Displaying appropriate and polite language and behavior suitable for professional work and relationships.

### Importance of Professional Ethics
Professional ethics is crucial for individuals, companies, and society as a whole:

*   **For Individuals:**
    *   Helps fulfill responsibilities and duties as a professional.
    *   Supports self-realization based on moral values.
*   **For Organizations & Society:**
    *   **Cooperation:** Essential for community life, fostering cooperation towards common interests.
    *   **Influence:** Vocational activities significantly impact company order and societal development.
    *   **Reliability & Competitiveness:** Ethics build trust, which is a vital factor for economic competitiveness (e.g., "Ethics rather than profit makes a company of 200 years").
    *   **Prevents Self-Interest:** Prevents individuals from solely prioritizing their own interests over others.
    *   **Order & Credibility:** Ensures necessary cooperation, maintains organizational credibility, and prevents societal disorder.
    *   **National Impact:** Directly linked to national competitiveness and economic development.

### Self-Assessment
*   Various checklists exist (like Table 96 in the original text) to help professionals assess their own level of professional ethics. These tools encourage reflection on behaviors related to virtue, ethical codes, diligence, honesty, responsibility, and commitment to collective interests.
