# Project Management: Earned Value & Quality Management

## Section 1: Earned Value Management (EVM)

**What is Earned Value Management (EVM)?**
EVM is a project performance technique that integrates schedule and cost to analyze performance and predict the project's final cost and schedule.

**Key EVM Terms & Formulas:**

*   **PV (Planned Value) / BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled):**
    *   The approved budget for the work *planned* to be performed by a certain date.
    *   *Example:* For a 5-day activity, PV = 5 days' budget.

*   **AC (Actual Cost) / ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed):**
    *   The costs *actually incurred* for the work completed to date.
    *   *Example:* If a 5-day activity took 6 days/persons, AC = 6 days' budget.

*   **EV (Earned Value) / BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed):**
    *   The *budgeted cost* of the work that has *actually been performed* (the value of work done).
    *   *Example:* If 80% of a 5-day activity is done, EV = 5 days * 0.8 = 4 days' budget.

---

### Schedule Performance Indicators:

*   **SV (Schedule Variance): EV - PV**
    *   Measures actual progress against expected progress.
    *   **SV > 0:** Ahead of schedule.
    *   **SV < 0:** Behind schedule.
    *   *Example:* EV=4, PV=5. SV = 4 - 5 = -1 (1 day behind schedule).

*   **SPI (Schedule Performance Index): EV / PV**
    *   Measures the efficiency of schedule performance.
    *   **SPI > 1:** On or ahead of schedule.
    *   **SPI < 1:** Behind schedule.

---

### Cost Performance Indicators:

*   **CV (Cost Variance): EV - AC**
    *   Measures actual cost against budgeted cost for work performed.
    *   **CV > 0:** Under budget.
    *   **CV < 0:** Over budget.
    *   *Example:* EV=4, AC=6. CV = 4 - 6 = -2 (2 units over budget).

*   **CPI (Cost Performance Index): EV / AC**
    *   Measures the efficiency of cost utilization.
    *   **CPI > 1:** On or under budget.
    *   **CPI < 1:** Over budget.

---

**Interpreting EVM Data (Example):**
If SV is negative and CV is negative, it means the project is both behind schedule and over budget.

**Forecasting Project Performance:**

*   **EAC (Estimate At Completion):**
    *   The estimated *total cost* of the project at completion.
    *   **Formula:** `EAC = AC (Actual Cost) + ETC (Estimate To Complete)`

*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):**
    *   The estimated cost of the *remaining work* to finish the project.
    *   **Methods to calculate ETC:**
        1.  **Considering CPI:** `ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI` (BAC = Budget At Completion)
            *   Assumes future work will be performed at the current cost efficiency.
        2.  **Using Original Budget:** `ETC = (BAC - EV)`
            *   Assumes future work will be performed at the original budgeted rate.
        3.  **New Estimate:** `ETC = New estimate for the remaining work`
            *   Used when past performance is not a good indicator for future work.

---

**Methods for Measuring Work in Progress (to calculate EV):**
These methods help assign an Earned Value to ongoing tasks:

*   **Percent Complete:** Assigns EV directly proportional to the physical percentage of work completed.
    *   *Example:* If 40% complete, claim 40% of the task's budget as EV.
*   **50/50 Rule:** 50% EV credit when a task starts, the remaining 50% when it's completed.
*   **20/80 Rule:** 20% EV credit when a task starts, the remaining 80% when it's completed.
*   **0/100 Rule:** 0% EV credit when a task starts, 100% only when it's fully completed.

## Section 2: Quality Management

**Why Quality Management is Important:**
Modern software projects are complex, leading to issues like delivery delays, low customer satisfaction, and high operational costs. Effective quality management addresses these challenges.

**Core Components of Quality Management:**
Quality management generally consists of:
1.  **Quality Planning:** Defining quality standards and how to meet them.
2.  **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring that the processes used to build the product are effective.
3.  **Quality Control:** Monitoring specific project results to verify they meet quality standards.
    *   The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is often used here.

**Key Terms & Standards:**

*   **Quality Standards:** ISO/IEC 9126 (Software Quality), ISO/IEC 12207 (Software Lifecycle), CMMI, Six Sigma, ISO 9000.
*   **Quality Evaluation Perspectives:** Product quality, Process quality, Project quality.

**Quality Control: Manufacturing vs. Project (IT Specifics):**

*   **Manufacturing Quality Control:** Focuses on *product quality*, managing defects across many identical products.
*   **Project Quality Control (especially IT Projects):**
    *   Focuses on *process quality* because outputs (like a system) are unique, few, and often intangible.
    *   The goal is to manage errors within the development process to produce a high-quality, error-free output.
    *   **For IT projects, quality control is crucial for *intermediate outputs* at each project stage** (e.g., analysis, design, execution, testing, deployment).

**Quality Management Activities & Support:**

*   Activities are carried out through techniques like:
    *   **Reviews:** Formal meetings to evaluate documents or products.
    *   **Inspections:** Structured process to find defects.
    *   **Walk-throughs:** Meeting where a work product is presented to peers for comments.
*   Guidance often comes from specialized quality management or quality assurance teams.
*   For enterprise-wide quality control, the **PMO (Project Management Office)** helps establish and monitor quality standards across projects.

**Benefits of Effective Quality Management:**

*   **Minimize Quality Cost:** By meeting customer requirements (e.g., of the acquirer) from the start.
*   **Reduce Rework:** Through clear requirements validation and verification.
*   **Improve Scope Management:** Prevents missing requirements.
*   **Improve Schedule Management:** Reduces wasted time caused by errors and rework.

The following  graph is an example  of earned  value management.  As of August 1, the planned  value (PV), actual
cost (AC), and earned value (EV) are measured,  and schedule  variance  (SV) and cost variance  (CV) are ana-
lyzed, for  project  value estimation.  The AC, which is costs actually  incurred,  was spent more than the PV, and
the EV, which indicates  the actual amount  of work completed,  was less than the PV.
To analyze the project cost, schedule  variance  (SV) = earned value (EV) - planned value (PV) is negative,
meaning  behind schedule,  and cost difference  (CV) = earned value (EV) - actual cost (AC) is also negative,
meaning  over budget.

Estimate  At Completion  (EAC) is “estimated  total cost at project completion’.  An important  advantage  of
the EVM is that the total cost of the project can be estimated  reasonably.  EAC is calculated  as the sum of
the actual cost (AC) incurred  from work completed  up to the point of performance  measurement  and the
estimated  cost of the remaining  work, or Estimate  To Completion  (ETC). Since the actual cost (AC) can be
known as the result of the performance  measurement,  only the Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) is calculated  to
come up with the EAC.
There are three methods  to calculate  the ETC according  to the results of performance  analysis.
How to apply the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work divided by the cost performance  index (CPI)
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) = (Budget  at Completion  (BAC) - Earned Value (EV)) / Cost Performance  Index
(CPI)
How to apply the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work without  change
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) = (Budget  at Completion  (BAC) - Earned Value (EV))
How to create a new budget  overriding  the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC)= New estimate  for the remaining  work
By adding  the ETC calculated  as above with the AC, the EAC can be estimated  as follows:
+ Estimate  At Completion  (EAC) = Actual Cost (AC) + Estimate  to Complete  (ETC)

It is difficult  to judge the value of work that has already been completed  or has not begun at the time
of performance  measurement.  However,  measuring  the value of work in progress may be less inaccurate
depending  on the criteria.  The value of the work in progress  can be measured  by choosing  one of the following
methods:
+ Percent  Complete
The amount  of completed  work against  the planned  budget  at completion
Example)  40% Complete  — 40% of the budget  claimed  as EV
+ 50/50 Rule
A task is considered  50% complete  when it starts. The remaini...
