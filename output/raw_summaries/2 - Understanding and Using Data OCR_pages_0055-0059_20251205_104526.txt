# ER Diagram Notations: A Learning Guide

This guide covers Entity-Relationship (ER) model notations, focusing on Chen's model, Extended ER (EER), and Crow's Foot notation.

## 1. Introduction to ER Notations

ER models visually represent data structures and relationships. Various notations exist:

*   **Chen's Notation (1976):** Developed by Peter Chen. Widely used for teaching database design theories in academia.
*   **IE / Crow's Foot Notation:** Most frequently used in industry due to its practical application.
*   **UML:** Uses stereotypes (`<<Entity>>`) for data modeling.
*   **Team, Team Bem, Min-Max / ISO, Case Method (Barker's Notation):** Less common or specific use cases.

## 2. Chen's ER Model

The Chen ER model was the first data modeling method to represent data configuration and correlation. It's useful for understanding theoretical concepts.

### 2.1. Basic Components & Notation Symbols

| Component                   | Symbol                     | Description                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Entity**                  | Rectangle                  | Meaningful unit of information (e.g., Student, Car, Project). Has an identifier.                        |
| **Weak Entity**             | Double Rectangle           | An entity without its own unique identifier; depends on another entity for identification.              |
| **Relationship**            | Diamond                    | Correlation between entities (e.g., Student `takes` Course).                                            |
| **Identifying Relationship**| Double Diamond             | Connects a weak entity to its identifying entity.                                                       |
| **Attribute**               | Ellipse                    | Represents an intrinsic characteristic of an entity or relationship.                                    |
| **Key Attribute (Identifier)** | Underlined Ellipse/Text    | An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies an entity instance (e.g., `student ID`).    |
| **Partial Key Attribute**   | Dashed Underlined Text     | An attribute of a weak entity that, when combined with the identifying entity's key, forms a unique identifier for the weak entity. |
| **Multi-valued Attribute**  | Double Ellipse             | Can have multiple values at the same time (e.g., `phone numbers`).                                      |
| **Derived Attribute**       | Dotted Ellipse             | Can be calculated/derived from other stored data (e.g., `age` from birth date, `number of employees` in a department). |
| **Composite Attribute**     | Ellipse with connecting lines | Can be decomposed into two or more elements (e.g., `Address` into street, city, zip).                   |

### 2.2. Relationships in Chen's Model

*   **Degree:** The number of entities participating in a relationship.
    *   **Unary:** 1 entity
    *   **Binary:** 2 entities
    *   **Ternary:** 3 entities
    *   **N-ary:** N entities
*   **Cardinality:** The maximum number of relationship instances an entity can participate in.
    *   **One-to-one (1:1):** Each entity instance relates to at most one instance of the other entity.
        *   *Example:* `Department` (1) `manages` `Student` (1)
    *   **One-to-many (1:N or N:1):** One entity instance can relate to multiple instances of another, but each instance of the other relates to only one.
        *   *Example:* `Student` (1) `belongs to` `Department` (N)
    *   **Many-to-many (M:N):** Multiple instances of one entity can relate to multiple instances of another.
        *   *Example:* `Student` (M) `takes` `Subject` (N)

## 3. Extended ER (EER) Model

The EER model adds advanced concepts to the basic ER model.

### 3.1. Generalization/Specialization

*   **Generalization:** A bottom-up approach of combining multiple sub-entity types (e.g., Car, Truck) into a higher-level super-type (e.g., Vehicle).
*   **Specialization:** A top-down approach of breaking down a super-type (e.g., Employee) into multiple sub-types (e.g., Manager, Engineer).
*   **Relationship Type:** These form an **IS-A** relationship (e.g., "A Car IS-A Vehicle").
*   **Inheritance:** Applies; sub-types inherit attributes and relationships from the super-type.

### 3.2. Aggregation

*   Defines a new higher-level entity from a set of multiple entities and their relationships. It treats a relationship as an entity.
*   **Relationship Type:** Forms an **IS-PART-OF** relationship.
*   **Inheritance:** Does **not** apply.

## 4. Crow's Foot ER Model

Crow's Foot notation (Information Engineering notation) is widely used in industry, in contrast to Chen's academic focus.

### 4.1. Entity, Attribute, Identifier Notation

*   **Entity:** Represented by a rectangle.
    *   Entity name is written **outside** the top of the rectangle.
    *   The rectangle is divided into two sections:
        *   **Top Section:** Lists identifier attributes (Primary Keys - PK).
        *   **Bottom Section:** Lists general attributes.
*   **Attributes:** Listed inside the rectangle.
*   **Identifier (PK):** Marked with "(PK)" next to the attribute name in the top section.

**Example Visual:**

```
+--------------------+
| Student            |
+--------------------+
| Student ID (PK)    |
+--------------------+
| Name               |
| Address            |
| Contact Information|
| Grade              |
+--------------------+
```

### 4.2. Characteristics of an Entity (Crow's Foot Context)

For a real-world concept to qualify as an entity in this model:

*   It must be **required** by the business/work process and information that needs to be **managed**.
*   It must be **identifiable** by a **unique identifier**.
*   It must represent a **set of instances** that exist permanently (i.e., typically two or more instances, not just one unique item).
*   It must be actively **used** by a work process.
*   It must possess at least one **attribute**.
*   It should have at least one **relationship** with another entity.

### 4.3. Classification of Entities

*   **By Tangible/Intangible Type:**
    *   Tangible entities (e.g., Patient)
    *   Concept entities (e.g., Course)
    *   Event entities (e.g., Order)
*   **By Time of Occurrence:**
    *   Fundamental/Key entities
    *   Main entities
    *   Active entities

03 Types of ER Notations
In 1976, Peter Chen created a form of notation for data models called an entity-relationship  model (ER model).
This notation  uses a rectangle,  a diamond,  and an ellipse to represent  an entity, a relationship,  and an attribute
respectively.  This notation  is widely used when learning  theories  about data modeling.  The main college courses  in
Korea use Chen’s model of notation  when teaching  database  design. The following  section describes  the various
notations  used to denote  entities, properties,  and relationships.
Chen - Used with many college
1 N teaching  materials.
Team - Hardly used for practical
business
- Used by the US Ministry  of
National  Defense.

04 ER Notation  Based on the Chen Model
The ER model presented  by Chen was the first data modeling  method  to represent  data configuration  and correlation.
This model is useful for understanding  the theoretical  concepts  of data modeling.

[Figure 12] ER model notation
A) Entity
@ An entity refers to a meaningful  unit of information  in the real world.
@ An entity includes  both physical  objects  and conceptual  objects.
+ Physical  object: student,  car, classroom
+ Conceptual  object: project,  job, subject
@ In general,  an entity has its own identifier  (key attribute)  and is represented  using a rectangle.
@ An entity without  its own identifier  is called a “weak entity’,  which is represented  using a two-line  rectangle.
B) Relationship
@ A relationship  refers to the correlation  between  entities  and is represented  using a diamond
Example)  The relationship  between  [student]  and [course]  is represented  as follows.
class
[Figure 13] Relationship  notation
@ The degree  of the relationship  represents  the number  of entities  participating  in the relationship.
+ Unary, binary, ternary, ---, N-ary
@ The cardinality  of the relationship  represents  the maximum  number  of relationship  instances  that can participate  in
the relationship.
+ There are one-to-one,  one-to-many  and many-to-many  relationships.

[Figure 14] Cardinality  of the relationship
@ The relationship  connecting  the weak entity and the identifying  entity is called an “identifying  relationship”  and is
distinguished  from the general  relationship  by marking  it with a two-line  diamond.
C) Attribute
@ An attribute  represents  the intrinsic  nature of an entity or relationship  and is represented  using an ellipse.
@ Identifier  (key attribute)
+ Anidentifier  is represented  by underlining  the attribute’s  name.
+ An attribute  or a set of attributes  that always has a unique value in all entity sets (e.g. student ID, vehicle
registration  number,  etc.)
+ When an identifier  is made by combining  several attributes,  the attributes  concerned  are combined  first to make a
complex  attribute,  and are then marked  by underlining  it.
+ If there are multiple  attributes  that can be an identifier,  mark all of them by underlining  them.
@ Weak entity separator  (partial key attribute)
As a weak entity does not have an identifier,  it should be connected  to another  entity that plays the role of an
identifying  entity, and the identifier  of the identifying  entity and some attributes  of the weak entity are combined  to be
used as the identifier.  The attributes  of the weak entity used at this time are called separator  or partial key attributes.
@ Multi-valued  attribute
A multi-valued  attribute  can have multiple  values at the same time, which are distinguished  from general attributes
(single-valued  attribute)  by marking  them with a two-line  ellipse
© Derived  attribute
A derived  attribute  refers to an attribute  that can be derived  from other stored data and is distinguished  from general
