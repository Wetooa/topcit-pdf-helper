# Database Design: A Learning Guide

## 1. Introduction to Database Design

Database design is the foundation for building any database. A structured approach, moving through distinct phases with clear deliverables, is crucial to minimize problems and ensure successful implementation.

## 2. Phases of Database Design

Database design typically involves three sequential phases, each building upon the previous one:

### A) Conceptual Model Design Phase
*   **Purpose:** Define the meaning of data and the fundamental relationships between data elements.
*   **Focus:** Identify the subject area, key **entities** (things of interest), and their **relationships**.
*   **Deliverable:** A **Conceptual Data Model**.

### B) Logical Model Design Phase
*   **Purpose:** Translate the conceptual model into a structure understandable by a specific database type (e.g., relational).
*   **Focus:** Define **attributes** (properties) for entities, establish **keys** (identifiers), specify entities in detail, and consider **history management** (how changes over time are tracked).
*   **Deliverable:** A final **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.

### C) Physical Model Design Phase
*   **Purpose:** Implement the database structure in a specific Database Management System (DBMS).
*   **Focus:** Implement the physical schema (tables, columns, indexes), considering database performance (e.g., applying **semi-normalization**).
*   **Deliverable:** A **Table Definition Document** detailing the physical structure.

## 3. Key Roles in Database Design

Two primary roles collaborate closely during database design:

*   **Data Architect (DA)**
    *   Plays the most important role from requirements gathering to overall model management.
    *   Establishes data management systems and defines data standards.
    *   Manages conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
*   **Database Administrator (DBA)**
    *   Focuses on the performance aspects of the physical model.
    *   Reviews and provides input on physical structures such as indexes, partitions, clustering, storage space, and **denormalization**.
*   **Collaboration:** DA and DBA must discuss and agree on the final physical model to achieve efficient and stable database performance.

## 4. Database Design in the Project Lifecycle

Data modeling fits into a project's lifecycle, often aligned with analysis and design phases:

*   **Traditional Approach:**
    *   **Analysis Phase:** Primarily involves business-oriented **logical data modeling**.
    *   **Design Phase:** Focuses on **physical data modeling**, considering hardware and performance.
    *   *Note:* In real projects, conceptual and logical data modeling are often combined within the analysis phase.
*   **Object-Oriented Concept:**
    *   Integrates data modeling and process modeling.
    *   Example: A "class" combines both data (**attributes**) and processes (**methods**).

## 5. Recent Trends & Key Practical Considerations

### A) Extended Data Models
*   **Evolution:** Modern data modeling often moves beyond simple entities and relationships to express complex business compositions and workflows.
*   **Features:** Incorporate object-oriented concepts like:
    *   **Super-type and Sub-type:** Expresses inheritance structures (e.g., a "Person" super-type with "Employee" and "Customer" sub-types). Approximately 70% of projects use this method.
    *   **Grouping Type:** Allows an entity to have multiple attribute values (e.g., an "Address" entity with multiple phone numbers).
*   **Challenge:** Despite advanced modeling techniques, physical data models are often created without clear standards, emphasizing the need for robust, practical application of techniques.

### B) Essential Techniques & Best Practices
To ensure effective database design, consider these practical points:

*   **Normalization Rules:** Fully understand and apply these fundamental rules when creating a database.
*   **Inquiry Performance:** Do not assume that normalized models are inherently slow for data retrieval.
*   **Denormalization:** Apply denormalization only when truly necessary and with a proper understanding of its implications.
*   **Data Independence:** Design a user-independent conceptual schema.
*   **Relationships:** Understand the difference and impact of **identifier relationships** (where a foreign key is part of the primary key) and **non-identifier relationships** (where it is not).
*   **Super-type/Sub-type Conversion:** Convert these structures carefully, considering performance implications.
*   **Model Completeness:** Always ensure your data model has all necessary relationships defined.
*   **History Data Modeling:** Design for tracking data changes (occurrence, change, progress) with performance in mind.
*   **Primary Keys:** When setting primary keys, consider their performance impact and how they interact with indexes.

02 Considerations  for Database  Design
Database  design is the key area in the process  of database  build. The possibility  of a problem arising can be minimized
when proceeding  with the next phase only when each phase is clearly arranged  and the deliverables  are accurately
produced.
A) Deliverables  to be analyzed
@ Considerations  in the conceptual  model design phase
The meaning  of data and the rules of the correlation  between  data are defined in this phase. A conceptual  data
model should be created  as a deliverable  by defining  the subject  area, key entity, and relationships  in this phase.
@ Considerations  in the logical model design phase
Attributes  and keys should be defined based on the previously  created conceptual  data model: entities  should be
specified  accordingly:  and a final entity-relationship  diagram  should be created  after defining  history  management.
© Considerations  in the physical  model design phase
A physical schema is implemented  in a physical data model to implement  a database.  Semi-normalization  can be
performed  in consideration  of performance  in this phase. A table definition  document  reflecting  these requirements  is
created,
B) Considerations  of the design subject
A data architect  (DA) plays the most important  role in the database  design phase. The data architect,  who is directly
involved  from the phase of requirement  collection,  establishes  a data management  system and defines the data
standards.  In addition,  the data architect  manages  the overall data models that are created by conceptual,  logical,
and physical modeling.  However,  the performance  aspect should be considered  in the physical modeling  phase, to
ensure that the database  concerned  will work well regardless  of whether  the user requirements  are implemented.  At
this time, the database  administrator  (DBA) may review and reflect the physical  structure  area, such as the indexes,
partitions,  as well as the clustering  storage  space, and denormalization.
That is, the data architect  and the database  administrator  should discuss and determine  the final physical model
which they regard as the best from their own perspectives  in the physical modeling  phase, so as to achieve  efficient
and stable performance.

03 Impact  of Database  Design in the Project  Lifecycle
Data modeling  can be clearly defined in the project lifecycle because  it is separated  into the analysis phase and the
design phase. Usually, business-oriented  logical data modeling  is performed in the analysis  phase, and physical  data
modeling  is performed  by considering  hardware  and performance  in the methodology,  based on information  engineering
or structural  models, In the spiral model, the logical data model and the physical  data model are performed  on both sides
according  to the size of the task in the analysis  and design phase. The logical data model is performed  more frequently
in the analysis  phase.
