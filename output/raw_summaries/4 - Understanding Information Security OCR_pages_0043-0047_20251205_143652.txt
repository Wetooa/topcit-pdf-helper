## **Information Security Learning Guide**

### **1. Public Key Certificates**

*   **Definition:** X.509 standard digital certificates issued by a Public Certificate Authority (CA).
*   **Purpose:** Used to verify identity and enable secure transactions.
*   **Key Types:**
    *   **NPKI Certificates:** For public use (financial, e-commerce).
    *   **GPKI Certificates:** For administrative agencies (administrative work).
*   **Recent Enhancements (since 2011):**
    *   RSA digital signature key length increased: 1,024 bits → **2,048 bits**.
    *   Hash function updated: SHA-1 (160-bit) → **SHA-256** (256-bit).
*   **Main Contents of a Public Key Certificate (e.g., NPKI):**
    *   **Version:** Certificate format version.
    *   **Serial Number:** Unique identifier from the issuing CA.
    *   **Algorithm Identifier:** Object Identifier (OID) of the signature algorithm used.
    *   **Issuer:** Distinguished Name (DN) of the CA that issued the certificate.
    *   **Period of Validity:** Start and expiration dates.
    *   **Subject:** DN of the certificate owner.
    *   **Public-key Information:** Subject's public key and its corresponding algorithm identifier.
    *   **Signature:** Digital signature created using the CA's private key.

#### **Verifying Certificate Validity**

1.  **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**
    *   **What it is:** A list of certificates that have been revoked by the CA.
    *   **Contents:** Includes serial number, revocation date, and reasons for revocation.
    *   **Mechanism:** Periodically downloaded from a distribution point.
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Long download cycle:** Revoked certificates might be used unnoticed.
        *   **Short download cycle:** Increases system overhead.

2.  **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)**
    *   **What it is:** Addresses CRL's periodic update shortcomings.
    *   **Mechanism:** Provides real-time certificate status on request when a user attempts access.
    *   **Standard:** Defined in RFC 6960.
    *   **Implementation:** Typically uses a server configured with HTTP.

### **2. Access Control Technology**

#### **A) Overview of Access Control**

*   **Concept:** Controlling *who* can access a system and *what tasks* they can perform.
*   **Three Core Components:**
    1.  **Identification:**
        *   **Process:** The system identifies a subject (user) using a unique token.
        *   **Examples:** User ID, employee card, biometrics.
    2.  **Authentication:**
        *   **Process:** The subject verifies its claimed identity to the system.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   **Knowledge-based:** Password.
            *   **Ownership-based:** Certificate, OTP (One-Time Password).
            *   **Presence-based:** Biometrics.
    3.  **Authorization:**
        *   **Process:** The system determines what tasks and objects the authenticated user is allowed to access/perform.
        *   **Examples:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

*   **Access Control Procedure:**
    Subject → **Identification** → **Authentication** → **Authorization** → Object → **Access**

#### **B) Access Control Policy**

*   **Definition:** High-level instructions guiding the design and management of an access control system.
*   **Purpose:** Defines *who* (subject), *when* (time), *where* (location), *what* (object), and *how* (behavior) is allowed or refused.
*   **Two Basic Policies:**
    1.  **Minimum Privilege Policy ("Need-to-Know"):**
        *   **Principle:** Subjects should only have access to the absolute minimum information required for their activities.
        *   **Benefit:** Strong control over object access.
        *   **Drawback:** Can sometimes impose excessive limitations on legitimate users.
    2.  **Maximum Privilege Policy:**
        *   **Principle:** Based on maximizing availability to increase benefits of data sharing.
        *   **Application:** Useful when no special protection is needed due to high reliability of data exchange.

#### **C) Types of Access Control Policies**

1.  **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Security levels are assigned to subjects, and security labels are assigned to objects. Access is determined by predefined rules based on these levels/labels.
    *   **Primary Use:** Military systems.
    *   **Pros:** Very strong security.
    *   **Cons:** Management efficiency is low.
    *   **Example:** A "Top Secret" subject can access "Top Secret" objects, but an "Unclassified" subject cannot.

2.  **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Access to an object is controlled by the subject's account identity or group membership. The *owner of the object* typically determines permissions.
    *   **Primary Use:** Unix or Linux system access control.
    *   **Example:** A file owner can grant read/write permissions to specific users or groups.

3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Administrators define roles (e.g., "HR Manager," "Sales Person") and map objects/permissions to these roles. Subjects are then assigned roles.
    *   **Primary Use:** Organizations with frequent changes in personnel or responsibilities.
    *   **Pros:** Improved management efficiency.
    *   **Cons:** Can potentially degrade security if roles are poorly defined or assigned.
    *   **Example:** An "HR Manager" role has access to "Personnel Information." A user assigned the "HR Manager" role automatically gets this access.

#### **D) Access Control Mechanisms**

1.  **Access Control Matrix**
    *   **Concept:** A table where subjects are rows, objects are columns, and each cell defines the access rights.
    *   **Management:** Manages all subject-object relationships.
    *   **Practicality:** Inefficient for large systems; typically implemented using ACLs and CLs.

2.  **ACL (Access Control List)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Manages access rights based on the *object*.
    *   **Representation:** Corresponds to a *column* in the Access Control Matrix (listing who can access this specific object and how).

3.  **CL (Capability List)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Manages access rights based on the *subject*.
    *   **Representation:** Corresponds to a *row* in the Access Control Matrix (listing what objects this specific subject can access and how).

4.  **SL (Security Label)**
    *   **Concept:** A set of security attribute information assigned directly to an object.

#### **E) Access Control Models**

1.  **Bell-Lapadula Model**
    *   **Focus:** **Confidentiality**.
    *   **Origin:** First mathematical model, supported by the U.S. Department of Defense (MAC policy).
    *   **Principle:** Emphasizes preventing secret leakage. Prevents information from flowing from higher security levels to lower security levels (e.g., "no read up," "no write down").

2.  **Biba Model**
    *   **Focus:** **Integrity**.
    *   **Purpose:** Designed to address the integrity shortcomings of the Bell-Lapadula model.
    *   **Note:** Does *not* guarantee confidentiality.

3.  **Clark and Wilson Model**
    *   **Focus:** **Integrity** (for commercial use).
    *   **Premise:** For some applications, preventing unauthorized alteration is more critical than preventing disclosure.
    *   **Mechanism:** Only authorized *programs* can access objects, not users directly.

4.  **Chinese Wall Model (Brewer-Nash)**
    *   **Focus:** Prevents **conflicts of interest**.
    *   **Principle:** Blocks information flow between competing companies or data sets (e.g., an analyst cannot access both company A's and company B's confidential data if they are competitors).
    *   **Concept:** Applies task separation to access control.

© Public key certificate
Public key certificates  are X. Public key certificates  are issued by a public CA by complying  with the X.509
standard.  Public certificates  include  the NPKI certificates,  which are used by the public for financial  transactions
and e-commerce  transactions,  and the GPK! certificate,  which are used by administrative  agencies  for
administrative  work.
The public certificate  encryption  system began to be advanced  in 2011, and the length of the digital signature
key of the RSA algorithm  has been increased  from 1,024 bits to 2,048  bits. The hash function  was replaced  by
SHA-256  (a hash function  producing  a 256-bit  value), instead of SHA-1 (a hash function  producing  a 160-bit
value). <Table 12> shows the main contents  included  in the NPKI certificate.
<Table 12> Main contents  of the public key certificate
Contents Description
Version Version of the certificate  format
Serial number Auunique  integer  value that represents  the certificate  serial number  of the issuing  CA
Algorithm  identifier A signature  algorithm  OID (Object  Identifier)  used to generate  the certificate
Issuer The DN (Distinguishing  Name) of the CA that issued the certificate
Period of validity The validity  period of the certificate.  The start and expiration  dates are represented
in seconds.
Subject The DN of the certificate  owner.
Public-key  information The subject's  public key and the identifier  of the algorithm  that will use this key.
Signature Signed with CA's private key.
© Method  of verifying  the validity  of the certificate
* CRL (Certificate  Revocation  List)
CRL refers to the list of certificates  revoked by the CA. The list contains  the serial number, the revocation
date, and the reasons  for revocation.  According  to RFC 3280, the certificate  can be permanently  revoked  or
temporarily  held. The CRL should be periodically  downloaded  from the CRL distribution  point. If the download
cycle is too long, a revoked certificate  can be used. If the cycle is too short, the overhead  increases  each
time the certificate  is used.
* OCSP (Online  Certificate  Status Protocol)
This protocol  makes up for the shortcomings  that the CRL should be periodically  updated.  When the user
attempts  to gain access, the OCSP protocol  immediately  answers  the validity  of the certificate by requesting
certificate  status information  in real time. The protocol  is defined in RFC 6960, and generally uses a server
configured  with the HTTP.

03 Access  control  technology
A) Overview  of access  control
@® Concept  of access  control
Access control refers to the task of controlling  who can access a system,  and which task the user can perform
when the user interacts  with the system. Specifically,  access control consists  of three parts: identification,
authentication,  and authorization.
+ Identification
A process  of identifying  a subject using its unique token, that is, a process  where the system identifies  the
subject.  (e.g., ID, employee  card, biometrics)
+ Authentication
A process  where the subject verifies its identity  to the system,  that is, a process  where the system
acknowledges  the user who claims his/her  identity  (e.g., password  (knowledge-based),  certificate  (ownership-
based), OTP (ownership-based),  biometrics  (presence-based)).
+ Authorization
A process  when the system controls  the task and object, which can be performed  and accessed  by the
authenticated  user (e.g., mandatory  access control, discretionary  access control, role-based  access control).
@ Access  control performing  procedure
An object can be accessed  only when the right to access is obtained  through  the authorization process  after
identification and authentication.

B) Access  control  policy
The system security  policy is the high-level  instructions  for designing  and managingthe  access control system.
In general, the policy is the expression  of the basic principles,  desired by the organization,  to protect  target
system  resources.  That is, the access  control principle  defines  the subject  (who), time (when), location  (where),
object (what), and behavior  (how) that can be accepted  or refused. The access  control principle,  which limits
the scope of access,  can be divided into the following  two basic policies:
@® Minimum  privilege  policy
This policy is called the “need-to-know’  policy. System  subjects  should use the minimum  amount  of information
that is needed for their activities.  This policy has the effect of applying  strong control over object access.
However,  sometimes  this policy may impose  excessive  useless  limitations  on the l...
