# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Guide

## 01. Data Structures

### A) Definition
A **Data Structure** is a method of storing data in a computer's memory. It organizes data systematically for efficient expression and utilization, considering data characteristics and usage.

### B) Classification
Data structures are divided into two main types:

1.  **Linear Structure:**
    *   **Definition:** Data are organized sequentially, connected in a row. They have a one-to-one relationship (before/after, adjacent).
    *   **Types:** Array, Linear List, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Dequeue.

2.  **Non-linear Structure:**
    *   **Definition:** Data have special forms like hierarchical structures, with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
    *   **Types:** Tree, Graph.

#### Comparison: Sequential vs. Linked Data Structures

| Item                   | Sequential Data Structure               | Linked Data Structure                     |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**            | Data stored consecutively in memory.    | Logical sequence expressed by links. Physical location doesn't matter. |
| **Logical/Physical Match** | Logical and physical sequences match.   | Logical and physical sequences do **not** match. |
| **Operations (Insert/Delete)** | Physical sequence changes due to operations; no empty space is created. | Physical sequence doesn't change; only link information changes. |
| **Programming Tech.**  | Implemented using an **array**.         | Implemented using a **pointer**.           |

### C) Stack and Queue

#### @ Stack
*   **Definition:** A linear data structure where data are added and removed only from one end, called the "top."
*   **Principle:** **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out). The last element added is the first one removed.
*   **Access:** Only from the **top**.
*   **Operations:**
    *   `top()`: Returns the data value at the top.
    *   `push()`: Inserts data onto the stack (at the top).
    *   `pop()`: Deletes and returns data from the stack (from the top).
    *   `isempty()`: Checks if the stack is empty (returns `true` or `false`).
    *   `isfull()`: Checks if the stack is full (returns `true` or `false`).

#### @ Queue
*   **Definition:** A linear data structure where data are added at one end (rear/bottom) and removed from the other end (front/top).
*   **Principle:** **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out). The first element added is the first one removed.
*   **Access:**
    *   Insertion (enqueue): At the **rear** (bottom).
    *   Deletion (dequeue): At the **front** (top).
*   **Operations:**
    *   `enQueue`: Inserts data into the queue (at the rear).
    *   `deQueue`: Deletes data from the queue (from the front).

#### Comparison: Stack vs. Queue Operations

| Item      | Data Structure | Operator (Insert) | Insert Location | Operator (Delete) | Delete Location |
| :-------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- |
| **Stack** | Stack          | `push`            | Top             | `pop`             | Top             |
| **Queue** | Queue          | `enQueue`         | Rear            | `deQueue`         | Front           |

### D) Tree and Graph

#### @ Tree
*   **Definition:** A non-linear, hierarchical data structure with a one-to-many relationship between elements. It expands from top to bottom.
*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Root Node:** The topmost node.
    *   **Edge:** The line connecting nodes.
    *   **Child Nodes:** Nodes with the same parent node.
    *   **Sibling Nodes:** Child nodes sharing the same parent.
    *   **Subtree:** A tree formed by a node and its descendants, disconnected from its parent.

#### @ Graph
*   **Definition:** A non-linear data structure expressing many-to-many relationships between connected elements. It's a set of **vertices** (objects) and **edges** (connections).
*   **Uses:** Solves complex problems like electric circuit analysis, shortest distance search, and AI.

#### Types of Graphs
*   **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction between vertices.
*   **Directed Graph:** Edges have a specific direction; the sequence of vertices in a pair is important.
*   **Complete Graph:** All vertices are connected to every other vertex.
*   **Weighted Graph:** Edges have numerical values (weights) assigned to them.

#### Graph Representation in Memory
1.  **Adjacency Matrix:**
    *   Uses a **sequential data structure** (2D array).
    *   Stores the presence of an edge between two vertices in a matrix (e.g., 1 for connected, 0 for not).
2.  **Adjacency List:**
    *   Uses a **linked data structure** (linked list).
    *   For each vertex, a linked list stores its adjacent vertices.

### E) Data Structure Selection Criteria
When choosing a data structure, consider:
*   Data processing time
*   Data size
*   Data utilization frequency
*   Data update frequency
*   Ease of programming

### F) Utilization of Data Structures
*   **List:** Array implementation, DBMS indexes, search/sorting problems.
*   **Stack:** Interrupt handling, recursive program control, saving return addresses (subroutines), postfix notation calculation, undo functions in editors.
*   **Queue:** Operating system job scheduling, asynchronous data exchange (file I/O, pipes, sockets), keyboard buffers, spool operations.
*   **Deque:** (Double-ended queue) Used in fields related to stacks and queues, leveraging strengths of both.
*   **Tree:** Search/sorting problems, grammar parsing, Huffman code, decision trees, games.
*   **Graph:** Computer networks (LAN, internet, web), electric circuit analysis, binary relations, simultaneous equations.

## 02. Algorithm

### A) Algorithm Overview

#### @ Algorithm Definition
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step description of procedures used to solve a problem. It's a logical, abstract specification of a problem-solving method. Algorithms aim not just for results, but for efficiency in processing time and storage space.

#### @ Conditions of Algorithms
For a procedure to be considered an algorithm, it must meet these conditions:

1.  **Input:** Takes zero or more data inputs from outside.
2.  **Output:** Produces one or more results after execution.
3.  **Definiteness:** Each processing step and its sequence must be clearly specified.
4.  **Finiteness:** The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
5.  **Effectiveness:** Each instruction must be basic enough to be carried out in principle by a person using pencil and paper. (Implicit in definiteness and finiteness, often included in formal definitions).

01 Data Structure
A) Definition
A data structure  is a method  of storing  data in the memory  device  of a computer.  It defines  data systematically
so that various data can be efficiently  expressed  and utilized, considering  the characteristics  and usages of
data.
B) Classification
The data structure  can be broadly divided into linear and non-linear  structures.  The linear structure  is a
method  of organizing  data in such a way that they are connected  in a row, whereas,  in the non-linear  structure,
data have a special form such as a hierarchical  structure.
<Table  8> Classification  of data structures
Classification Description
Data are arranged  in a straight  line by considering  the sequence  of the data. Data are arranged  in a
Linear  structure one-to-one  relationship  between  data and before/after,  adjacent  to, previous/next  data.
The types of linear structure  include  array, linear list, linked list, stack, queue, and dequeue.
It is a structure  in which several data exist after one data. Data adjacent/before  and after data are
Non-linear  structure arranged  in a one-to-many  or many-to-many  relationship.
The types of non-linear  structure  include  tree and graph.

C) Stack and queue
@ Stack
A stack is one of the linear lists. In this data structure,  data are saved in the storage space in order of data
input, and the last input data are output first. That is, an element  stored in the stack can be accessed  only
from the place designated  as the top, and an element  is inserted  at the top only and the inserted  element  is
stacked  on the top and output  first.

[Figure  2] Conceptual  diagram  of the stack
The types of stack operations  are as follows.
+ top(): Returns  the data value at the top of the stack.
+ push(): Inserts data on the stack.
+ pop(): Deletes  and returns  data from the stack.
+ isempty():  Returns ‘true’ if there is no element  on the stack or returns ‘false’ if there is an element  on the
stack.
+ isfull(): Returns  ‘false’ if there is no element  on the stack or returns ‘true’ if there is an element  on the stack.
@ Queue
Like the stack, the location  of insertion  and deletion is limited. However,  unlike the stack, the place of data
insertion  is different  from that of deletion.  The queue has a structure  in which an element  can be inserted  at
the bottom  and deleted at the top only. Elements  are listed in order of insertion,  and the element  inserted  first
is at the front and thus is deleted  first.

D) Tree and graph
© Tree
A tree is a hierarchical  data structure  with a hierarchical  relationship  between  elements.  It has a tree-like
structure  that expands  from top to bottom,  and the elements  have a one-to-many  relationship.
The topmost  node in a tree is called the “root node’, and the line connecting  the nodes is called the “edge”.
Child nodes having the same parent node are called “sibling  nodes’, and the tree created  when the edge to the
