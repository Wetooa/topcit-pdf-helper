## Project Management & Organization: Learning Guide

This guide summarizes essential concepts, roles, and methodologies in project management.

---

### **1. Project Organization & Roles**

#### **1.1. Project Organization Structure**
A project organization typically includes:
*   **Project Managers (PMs)**
*   **Project Leaders (PLs)**: Lead development teams.

*(Note: The structure can vary based on project goals and characteristics.)*

#### **1.2. Project Manager (PM) Responsibilities & Role**
A PM is responsible for the entire project scope and schedule. Key duties include:
*   Overseeing and communicating project progress.

### **2. Project Management Office (PMO)**

#### **2.1. What is a PMO?**
The PMO is an organization dedicated to achieving effective, enterprise-wide project management.

#### **2.2. Role and Importance of PMO**
*   **General Purpose:** Centralize and standardize project management practices across an organization.
*   **In Korea (e-government projects):** Functions as a system to entrust professionals with knowledge and skills to efficiently perform projects (per Electronic Government Act). It oversees, mediates issues, and consults, complementing the client's expertise.
*   **For Intangible Informatization Projects:** Essential for high credibility. Provides pre-diagnosis, thorough planning, quantitative process management, periodic communication, and quality assurance.

#### **2.3. PMO Classification**
PMOs can be classified into 4 types based on various criteria:

**A. PMO Type**
*   **Internal:** PMO composed of internal project managers.
*   **External:** PMO composed of external project managers.
*   **Combined (Mixed):** A mix of internal and external project managers/skills.

**B. PMO Role & Responsibility (R&R)**
*(Affected by corporate structure)*
*   **Weather Station Model:**
    *   Acts as a facilitator with a small number of professionals.
    *   Provides progress information, distributes PM knowledge.
    *   Develops and disseminates methodologies.
*   **Coach Model:**
    *   An extended Weather Station model.
    *   Promotes common methodologies and software tools.
    *   Operates communities for team communication, monitors performance, and provides PM experts.
*   **Control Tower Model:**
    *   Deeply involved in all projects and decision-making.
    *   Applies a consistent methodology across all projects.
    *   Provides centralized management, coordinates, and determines project resources.

**C. PMO Position**
*   **Full-time PMO:** A project manager is dedicated to one project and manages it intensively.
*   **Part-time PMO:** A project manager is in charge of two or more projects simultaneously.

**D. PMO Skill**
Determined by the specialized expertise of the individual project managers within the PMO, such as:
*   Development
*   Consulting
*   Project Evaluation
*   Database Management
*   Quality Management
*   Development Methodology

### **3. Project Management Trends & Concepts**

#### **3.1. Recent Trends & Key Issues**
*   Project management processes are not "one-size-fits-all."
*   Tailor the project lifecycle and management processes to the specific project environment and conditions.
*   **Agile Processes** are increasingly important to understand and apply.

#### **3.2. Learning Objectives**
By studying this material, you should be able to:
1.  Explain the project life cycle (preparation, initiation).
2.  Explain project management methodologies.
3.  Explain the concept and execution of Agile processes.

#### **3.3. Concept Summary**
*   **Project Life Cycles:** Predictive, Iterative, Adaptive
*   **Project Management Process Groups:** Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing
*   **Project Management Methodologies:** PMBOK, ISO21500, PRINCE2
*   **Agile Process Types:** Scrum, XP (eXtreme Programming), Kanban, Lean
*   **Agile Process Execution Methods:** Backlog, Burndown Chart, Scrum Master, Sprint, Retrospective, Daily Meeting

#### **3.4. Practical Business Preview**
*   Project management methodologies and processes are influenced by a company's organizational structure and how they are applied.
*   **Waterfall Methodology:** A traditional, sequential model. It can evolve into iterative or adaptive life cycles through overlapping or repetition of its phases. It is planning-based.
*   **Agile Methodology:** A value-oriented approach (contrasts with planning-based Waterfall).
*   **Scrum (an Agile type):** Focuses on improving project productivity through active cooperation and communication among people, rather than strict formalities.
*   **Challenges:** Applying Agile methodologies can be difficult in environments with vertical organizational structures or imbalanced power relationships (e.g., between an acquirer and a supplier).

### **4. Project Life Cycle**

#### **4.1. General Project Life Cycle**
A project typically progresses through five main processes:
1.  **Initiating:** Starting the project.
2.  **Planning:** Defining scope, objectives, and actions.
3.  **Executing:** Carrying out the work defined in the plan.
4.  **Monitoring & Controlling:** Tracking progress, managing changes, and ensuring objectives are met.
5.  **Closing:** Formalizing acceptance of the project or phase and bringing it to an orderly end.

*(Note: If a project is stopped mid-way, the closing process is executed immediately.)*

ESSENCE
The project organization  consists of project  managers  (PM), project leaders (PL) who lead each development
team, developers,  quality assurance  (QA) staff under the direct control of PMs, SA (software  architect)  for ar-
chitect support,  PMO (Project  Management  Office) for project management  support,  project support  groups
(UI design, testing, etc.), architect  team, PM, etc., as well as steering  committees  and sponsors  who support
higher-level  decisions,  such as changes  in the scope and schedule  of the project. Of course, the project orga-
nization  may vary depending  on the goals and characteristics  of each individual  project.
B) Responsibilities  and roles of project  manager
“Who is the project  manager,  and what does the person do on the project?”
The project manager  is the person responsible  for the entire scope and schedule  of the project. In other
words, the person oversees  and communicates  the progress  of the project, as well as resolving  issues and
risks to quality and stakeholders  from the initial stage to the end of the project.”  Project managers  need to
understand  and be able to exert the following three distinct  competencies  in order to carry out a project.

C) Project  management  office (PMO)
Many companies  have thought  about how to conduct  an effective  enterprise-wide  project management  for
several decades.  As a result, an organization  dedicated  to the project  called the Project Management  Office
(PMO) has come into being.
In Korea, PMO functions  as a system that entrusts  persons  with professional  knowledge  and technical  skills
to efficiently  perform  e-government  projects  in accordance  with Article 64-2 “Entrustment  of Management  of

Electronic  Government  Projects”  of Electronic  Government  Act. It plays the role of overseeing  and the entire
project, mediating  issues, and consulting,  from the standpoint  of complementing  the client's  expertise,
In the case of intangible  informatization  projects  requiring  a high level of credibility,  PMO is needed  for pre-di-
agnosis,  thorough  planning  for each stage of the project,  quantitative  process  management,  periodic  commu-
nication  and quality assurance  of outputs.
PMO can be classified  according  to the type, responsibility,  and role of PMO, time horizon  of the project,  and
skill division  of PMs, into 4 types as follows.

When the PMO organization  is composed  of internal project managers,  it becomes  an internal organization,  an
external  organization  if composed  of external  project  managers,  and a mixed type in case of skill mix.

As the PMO is affected  by the corporate  structure,  it is classified  into the weather  station model that acts

responsible  for guides and processes,  and the control tower model that has a great influence  on the overall
