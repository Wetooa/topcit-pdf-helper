*   **Management:** Promote and practice ethical software development and maintenance.
*   **Profession:** Advance the integrity and reputation of the profession, aligning with public interest.
*   **Colleagues:** Be fair and supportive of fellow professionals.
*   **Self:** Commit to lifelong learning and ethical practice within the profession.

#### B. ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) Code of Professional Ethics

Professionals should:

1.  **Support Standards:** Encourage compliance with standards for IT governance (audit, control, security, risk management).
2.  **Professional Conduct:** Perform duties with objectivity, diligence, and professional care.
3.  **Stakeholder Interest:** Act lawfully in stakeholders' interest, upholding high standards of conduct.

6.  **Transparency:** Inform parties of work results, disclosing significant facts that could distort reporting if withheld.
7.  **Education:** Support education for stakeholders to enhance their understanding of IT governance and management.

#### C. The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers (KIEE) Code of Professional Ethics

KIEE members value electrical engineering's impact on life, harmony, and act with a high sense of ethics. They pledge:

1.  **Social Responsibility:** Contribute to social development and make decisions prioritizing public safety and well-being.

### Section 2: Personal Information: Key Concepts and Importance

**Recent Trends and Major Issues:**

*   **Proliferation:** Various personal data (network, biometric, location) is widespread across industries.
*   **Asset Shift:** Personal information is now a valuable asset for companies and countries.
*   **High Risk:** Leakage is common due to unauthorized use, careless management, internal breaches, and hacking.
*   **Severe Consequences:** Leaks damage corporate image, cause financial losses, and can even harm national branding.

**Learning Objectives:**

*   Understand the concept and types of personal information.
*   Understand policies related to personal information.

**Key Terms:**

*   **Personal Information:** Any data that identifies a living individual.
*   **De-identified Personal Information:** Data processed so that a specific individual cannot be identified without additional information.
*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** A key data protection law (EU-centric, but with global impact).

---

### Section 3: Real-World Impact: Personal Information Leaks

**Case Study Example: Accommodation App Leak**

*   **Incident:** A hacker infiltrated an accommodation app, leaking personal information from 8 companies.
*   **Data Leaked:** Website IDs, names, dates of birth, emails, phone numbers, addresses, passport numbers, accommodation reservations.
*   **Regulatory Action:** The Korea Communications Commission imposed significant penalties (fines, correction orders, disciplinary actions) for "severe violations" of personal information protection measures (e.g., access control, encryption) under the "Network Act."
*   **Takeaway:** Data breaches are serious, frequent, and result in substantial penalties and reputational damage.

**Past Leak Examples (Key Themes):**

*   Numerous past incidents in domestic companies show recurring violations involving unauthorized access, hacking, and improper data provision to third parties.
*   These incidents consistently lead to large numbers of victims and severe administrative sanctions (large fines, corrective orders).

### Section 4: Understanding Personal Information in Detail

#### A. Concept of Personal Information

**Definition (from Personal Information Protection Act, Article 2):**

"Personal information" means any information relating to a **living individual** that:

*   **Directly identifies** them (e.g., full name, resident registration number, image).
*   **Can be easily combined with other information** to identify a particular individual, even if it doesn't identify them by itself.
