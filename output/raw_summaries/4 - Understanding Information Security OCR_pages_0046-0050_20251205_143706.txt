# Information Security Learning Guide

## 1. Access Control Policies

### A) Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
*   **Concept:** The owner of an object (e.g., a file) determines who can access it and what permissions they have.
*   **Application:** Primarily used in Unix or Linux system access control.
*   **Example:** General Manager Lee owns "Personnel Information" and grants access rights.

### B) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Concept:** An administrator defines specific **roles** (e.g., HR Manager, Sales Person). Objects are then mapped to these roles (i.e., which objects each role can access). Finally, subjects (users) are assigned to roles, granting them access based on their role.
*   **Use Case:** Suitable for organizations or systems with frequent changes in user responsibilities.
*   **Pros:** Improves management efficiency.
*   **Cons:** Can potentially degrade security if roles are not managed carefully.
*   **Example:** General Manager Lee is assigned the "Person in charge of HR" role, which allows access to "Personnel information."

## 2. Access Control Mechanisms

These mechanisms manage the relationships and rights defined by access control policies.

### A) Access Control Matrix
*   **Concept:** A table where rows represent **subjects** (users, processes) and columns represent **objects** (files, resources). Each cell in the matrix specifies the access rights a particular subject has over a particular object.
*   **Management:** Manages all relationships between subjects and objects.
*   **Practicality:** Inefficient for direct searching, so it's often divided into ACLs and Capability Lists for easier management.

### B) Access Control List (ACL)
*   **Concept:** Manages access rights based on the **object**. For each object, there's a list of subjects and their corresponding permissions.
*   **Relation to Matrix:** Corresponds to a column in the Access Control Matrix.

### C) Capability List (CL)
*   **Concept:** Manages access rights based on the **subject**. For each subject, there's a list of objects they can access and their permissions, often in a linked list format.
*   **Relation to Matrix:** Corresponds to a row in the Access Control Matrix.

### D) Security Label (SL)
*   **Concept:** A set of security attribute information assigned to an object (e.g., "Confidential," "Top Secret").

## 3. Access Control Models

These are established frameworks for implementing access control policies.

### A) Bell-LaPadula Model
*   **Focus:** **Confidentiality**.
*   **Purpose:** Designed to prevent information leakage from higher security levels to lower ones.
*   **Principle:** "No read up, no write down" (a subject at a given security level cannot read information at a higher level, nor can it write information to a lower level).
*   **Origin:** First mathematical model, supported by the U.S. Department of Defense.

### B) Biba Model
*   **Focus:** **Integrity**.
*   **Purpose:** Designed to guarantee data integrity, addressing a shortcoming of the Bell-LaPadula model (which prioritizes confidentiality).
*   **Principle:** "No read down, no write up" (a subject at a given integrity level cannot read information at a lower integrity level, nor can it write information to a higher integrity level).
*   **Note:** Does not guarantee confidentiality.

### C) Clark and Wilson Model
*   **Focus:** **Integrity** (especially for commercial use).
*   **Purpose:** Emphasizes preventing unauthorized alteration of data, considering it more important than preventing secret disclosure in some commercial applications.
*   **Key Feature:** Objects can only be accessed by specific, authorized **programs**, ensuring controlled integrity.

### D) Chinese Wall Model (Brewer-Nash)
*   **Focus:** **Conflict of interest prevention**.
*   **Purpose:** Blocks information flow that could lead to conflicts of interest.
*   **Application:** Applies the concept of "task separation" to access control, preventing users from accessing competing information domains.

## 4. Latest Information Security Threats

### Overview
The landscape of cyber threats is constantly evolving, becoming more intelligent, advanced, and diversified, often combining various attack technologies and social engineering. Emerging technologies like IoT and Big Data require urgent attention to security planning.

### A) APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Attacks

#### 1. Concept
*   **Definition:** A hacking strategy involving complex, intelligent, and sustained attacks.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Targeted:** Focuses on specific political, social, economic, technological, or military entities.
    *   **Persistent:** Involves long-term information gathering and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Advanced:** Utilizes various attack techniques, including social engineering and sophisticated hacking tools.

#### 2. Procedure
APT attacks follow multiple stages:
*   **Stage 1 (Infiltration):** Attacker infects vulnerable systems or employee PCs with malware (e.g., via phishing, infected media).
*   **Stage 2 (Internal Penetration):** The malware allows the attacker to infiltrate the internal network.
*   **Stage 3 (Information Collection):** The attacker collects information about the compromised internal systems and infrastructure, preparing for the main objective.
*   **Stage 4 (Exploitation/Exfiltration):** The attacker steals important information, aims to destroy systems, or launches Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from the vulnerable systems.

#### 3. Countermeasures
Implementing robust security practices across different organizational levels is crucial.

*   **Strengthening Security Management, Operation, and Education:**
    *   Regularly analyze organizational security threats and reorganize security systems.
    *   Conduct vulnerability assessments based on analysis of target security systems.
    *   Ensure continuous management, constant security control, and regular mock hacking exercises.
    *   Focus on the security management organization for continuous operation.
*   **Endpoint Security:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Endpoints (user computers, devices) are primary targets for APT attacks, as malware can infiltrate via the internet, email, SNS, messengers, P2P, or USBs.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Keep operating systems (OS) updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Install and operate security software (e.g., anti-malware, EDR).
        *   Implement application control based on a whitelist (only allowing approved applications to run).

D) Access  control mechanisms
@ Access  control matrix
Subjects  and objects are represented  in rows and columns,  and each entry in the matrix represents  access
rights. All relationships  between  the subjects  and the objects are managed  in a matrix. Since it is inefficient
to search a matrix to access a specific  resource,  it is divided into a capability  list and an access control list for
easy management.

© CL (Capability  List)
Based on the subject,  the rights to access the object are managed  in a linked list format. The list corresponds
to the row of the access  control matrix.
@® SL (Security  Label)
SL refers to a set of security  attribute  information  assigned  to an object.
E) Access  control  models
@ Bell-Lapadula  model
The first mathematical  model that was designed,  with the support  of the U.S. Department  of Defense,  as an
access control model (MAC policy) based on compulsory  policies.  This model emphasizes  confidentiality.  It puts
emphasis  on secret leakage  prevention,  rather than illegal information  destruction  or alteration,  and it prevents
information  from flowing  from the high level to the low level.
@ Biba model
A model designed  to guarantee  integrity,  which is the shortcoming  of the Bell-Lapadula  model (however,
confidentiality  is not guaranteed).  This model deals with integrity  as an item that is accessed  by the subject.
® Clark and Wilson model
A model designed  for commercial  use with a focus on integrity.  This model assumes  that alteration  prevention
can be more important  than secret disclosure  prevention,  depending  on the characteristics  of the information,
when handling  the security  requirements  of the application.  In this model, only programs  can access  the object
all the time.
@ Chinese  wall model (Brewer-Nash)
A model that blocks the flow of any information  that causes a conflict.  This model prevents  conflicts  of interest
and applies  the concept  of task separation  to access control.
