*   **Key Concern:** Difficulty in knowing the exact location of stored data and its accumulation in the cloud.
*   **Public Cloud Issue:** Reliability and stability concerns arise when storing sensitive data on external public cloud spaces, hindering adoption.

**2. Threats of Cloud Security**
*   **Hypervisor Infection:** A vulnerability in the **hypervisor** (software that creates and runs virtual machines) can simultaneously damage multiple virtual machines (VMs) it hosts.
*   **Attack Against Virtual Machines (VMs):** Interconnected VMs create attack paths for internal threats like packet sniffing, hacking, DDoS attacks, and malware spread.
*   **Attacker Tracking Difficulty:** Existing network security tools (firewall, IPS, IDS) struggle to detect and trace attackers within the virtual environment.
*   **Portability of Virtual Machines:** Easy movement of VMs between physical platforms allows malware-infected VMs to spread malware when ported to new platforms.

**3. Countermeasures Against Cloud Security Threats**
*   **Protect Incoming/Outgoing Data:** Maintain confidentiality using security protocols like TLS, SSH, and VPN for data sent to cloud servers over the Internet.
*   **Encrypt Stored Data:** Encrypt data before storing it in cloud storage. Use strong cryptographic algorithms like AES-256 or better.
*   **Secure Access and Authentication:**
    *   Implement robust access and authentication mechanisms.
    *   Change administrator passwords periodically.
    *   Establish and enforce access control policies (e.g., 2-factor authentication).
*   **Secure Independence Between VMs:** Maximize virtual network security to protect against shared resource threats and ensure complete isolation between user-accessed VMs.
*   **Attack and Intrusion Detection:**
    *   **Hypervisor-type detection:** Analyzes the internal state of each VM via the hypervisor to detect intrusions.
    *   **VM-type detection:** An agentless (no software installed on the VM itself) virtual security detection technique.

### C) Big Data Security

**1. Overview of Big Data Security**
*   **Increased Risk:** Rapid big data adoption increases personal information leakage risk due to vast collection and concentration of sensitive data (credit, location, behavior).
*   **Impact:** Leakage incidents are magnified in scope and scale.
*   **Priority:** Security is paramount for big data adoption, especially in finance.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Secure management throughout the big data lifecycle (collection to destruction) is crucial.

**2. Security Threat and Response by Big Data Lifecycle Phase**

*   **Big Data Collection Phase:**
    *   **Personal Information:** De-identify personal information if not legally permitted or consented to by the owner.
    *   **Active Data Collection (e.g., Chukwa, Scribe, Flume):** Obtain owner consent for data connection; apply access controls.

**3. Overview of Personal Information De-identification**

*   **Concept:** Processing data to make it difficult to identify a specific individual, even if other information is combined with the de-identified data. This involves deleting or replacing identifying information.
*   **Targets:** Information that can identify an individual on its own, or information that can easily identify an individual when combined with other data.
*   **De-identification Techniques (General Categories):**
    *   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing key identifying elements with other values.
    *   **Aggregation:** Showing total data values to prevent individual identification.
    *   **Data Reduction:** Removing unnecessary or identifying values from the data set.
    *   **Data Suppression:** Converting data values into category values.
    *   **Data Masking:** Adding random noise or replacing with space to hide key identifiers.

**4. Major Personal Information De-identification Technologies and Utilization Methods**

*   **Heuristic Pseudonymization:**
    *   **Method:** Hides identifier values based on pre-defined rules or data handler's discretion.
    *   **Applicability:** Names, user IDs, department names, addresses, phone numbers, email accounts, etc.
*   **K-anonymity:**
    *   **Method:** Ensures that at least 'k' records share the same attribute values, preventing re-identification based on those attributes.
    *   **Applicability:** Age, height, address, zip code, department.

B) Cloud security
@® Overview  of cloud security
Concerns  about cloud security  begin with the fact that the exact location  of the stored data cannot be easily
understood,  and the data is accumulated,  due to the characteristics  of the cloud. In particular,  when using a
public cloud, the question  of whether  storing sensitive  data on the cloud, which is an external  storage  space, is
correct  in terms of reliability  and stability,  is becoming  an obstacle  to cloud adoption  and spread.
@ Threats  of cloud security
+ Hypervisor  infection
If the hypervisor  in the virtualization  system,  which is essential  to run the cloud service,  is vulnerable,  several
virtual machines  (VMs) using the hypervisor  can be damaged  at the same time.
+ Attack against  the virtual machine
As the users’ virtual machines  are interconnected,  there is an attack path from an internal  virtual machine  to
another  virtual machine,  such as packet sniffing,  hacking,  DDoS attack, and malware  spread.
+ Attacker  tracking
It is difficult for existing  network  security  equipment  (firewall,  IPS, IDS, etc.) to detect attacks and intrusions
against  the inside of the virtualized  machine,  because  it is not easy to identify and trace an attacker  in the
virtual environment.
+ Portability  of the virtual machine
Since virtual machines  can be easily transported  between  physical platforms  in the virtualization,  there is a
possibility  that malware  can spread easily, as the virtual machine  infected  with malware  is ported to another
physical  platform.
® Countermeasures  against  cloud security  threats
+ Protecting  incoming  and outgoing  data
The confidentiality  of incoming  and outgoing  data should be maintained  by using TLS, SSH, VPN, etc. for
security  issues that may occur when sending  user data to the cloud server through  the Internet.
+ Encrypting  data when storing  data
Data should be encrypted  before storing it in the cloud storage,  and at least AES-256  and a secure
cryptographic  algorithm  should be used.
+ Access  and authentication
A secure access and authentication  mechanism  should be applied, the administrator  password  should be
changed  periodically,  and access control policies,  such as 2-factor,  should be established  and observed.

Information  security )
+ Securing  independence  between  VMs
A system  should be protected  by utilizing  the strengths  of a V's virtual network  security  against  the threat
to the shared repository  and shared network  to the maximum  extent, and complete  isolation between  the
VMs accessed  by users should be provided.
+ Attack and intrusion  detection
Attacks and intrusions  should be detected  by applying  the hypervisor  type detection  technique,  which
analyzes  the internal state of each virtual machine  and detects  intrusions  using the hypervisor,  and the VM
type detection  technique,  which is an agentless  virtual security  detection  technique.
C) Big data security
@® Overview  of big data security
As big data is introduced  at a rapid rate, the risk of personal  information  leakage is also increasing  because
an enormous  amount  of customer  information  is collected  and concentrated.  Unlike existing  data types, big
data extensively  collects and analyzes  sensitive  personal  information,  such as credit information,  location
information,  and behavior information.  Therefore,  the scope and scale of a leakage incident  are inevitably
enlarged  if it occurs. Hence, security  should be ensured  most of all to spread the use of big data in the financial
sector. The safe management  of big data by lifecycle,  from big data collection  to destruction,  is important.
@ Security  threat and response  by the phase of the big data lifecycle
+ Big data collection  phase
If the data of a specific individual  is to be collected,  the individual’s  personal  information  should be de-
identified  if it is not allowed  by the law or agreed to by the owner in advance.
When collecting  big data using active data collection  technologies,  such as Chukwa,  Scribe, and Flume, the
owner of the data to be connected  should consent,  and access  controls  should be applied to the data. When
using passive data collection  technologies,  such as Web Robot or Web Crawler, robot exclusion  standards
should be complied  with.
+ Big data storage  and management  phase
Data should be encrypted  using a cryptographic  technique  suitable for data distribution  and replication,
technical  and physical  access controls  should be applied, and data should be de-identified  through  data
filtering  before being stored.
+ Data processing  and analysis  phase
Data anonymization  techniques,  such as K-anonymity,  L-diversity,  and differential  privacy, should be used
to de-identify  data in the processing  and analysis  phase. Sensitive  information  should be processed  in an
