    *   **Example:**
        *   Premise 1: All men are mortal.
        *   Premise 2: Socrates is a man.
        *   Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

2.  **Inductive Reasoning:**
    *   **Definition:** Deriving a general principle or hypothesis from several concrete, empirical facts. (Introduced by Francis Bacon in 1620).
    *   **Example:**
        *   Concrete Fact 1: Socrates is dead.
        *   Concrete Fact 2: Socrates is a man.
        *   General Principle: Therefore, a man is mortal.

*   **Persuasion Beyond Pure Logic:** Logical explanation alone is often insufficient for effective persuasion.

*   **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:**
    *   **Purpose:** To statistically explain or verify an established hypothesis.
    *   **Key Concepts:**
        *   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The initial argument, based on existing knowledge or status quo (e.g., "The average life expectancy of men in Korea is 70 years").
        *   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A new argument that you aim to prove true through testing (e.g., "The average life expectancy of men in Korea is not 70 years").
    *   **Process:** Statistical tests are performed to determine whether to reject the Null Hypothesis and adopt the Alternative Hypothesis.

# Learning Guide: Reasoning, Hypothesis Testing, and Problem Solving

## 1. Logical Reasoning Fundamentals

**A. Deductive Reasoning**
*   **Definition:** Deriving a specific fact from general, known premises.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Direct Reasoning:** One fact from one premise.
    *   **Indirect Reasoning:** Concrete facts from two or more premises.
*   **Example (Indirect):**
    *   All men are mortal. (Premise 1)
    *   Socrates is a man. (Premise 2)
    *   Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)

**B. Inductive Reasoning**
*   **Definition:** Deriving a general principle from several concrete/empirical facts.
*   **Inventor:** Francis Bacon (1620).
*   **Process:** Make hypotheses from empirical facts, then judge truth with more empirical facts.
*   **Example:**
    *   Socrates is dead. (Concrete fact)
    *   Socrates is a man. (Concrete fact)
    *   Therefore, a man is mortal. (General principle)

**C. Limitations of Logical Explanation**
*   Both deductive and inductive reasoning provide logical explanations.
*   However, logical explanation alone is often **not enough to persuade stakeholders**. Additional methods are needed.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing for Persuasion & Verification

*   Used to explain or verify an established hypothesis, often with statistical methods.
*   Involves two mutually exclusive statements:

**A. Null Hypothesis (H0)**
*   **Definition:** An initial argument recognized based on existing knowledge or status quo.
*   **Example:** The average life expectancy of men in Korea is 70 years old.

**B. Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**
*   **Definition:** A new argument that you hope to prove as a new truth through testing. It contradicts the null hypothesis.
*   **Example:** The average life expectancy of men in Korea is **not** 70 years old (or has increased to over 70).

**C. Process Overview**
*   Hypotheses are adopted or rejected based on statistical hypothesis testing.
*   If H0 is rejected and H1 is adopted, it means the existing claim (H0) is found to be false, and the new claim (H1) is supported.

These techniques focus on making efficient and effective decisions among multiple alternatives.

*   **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MADM)**
    *   **Definition:** A technique for selecting the best alternative by considering various factors or criteria, rather than just one.
    *   **Process:** Evaluate how well each alternative meets its characteristic attributes (factors) to inform the final decision.

*   **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**
    *   **Definition:** A technique that structures complex decision-making information into a hierarchical tree.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Segments complex and non-quantifiable problems.
        2.  Evaluates segmented problems through **pairwise comparisons** (comparing two elements at a time).
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies complex problems, making elements easier for decision-makers to compare and judge.

---

## V. Essential Problem-Solving Skills

These are common competencies for effective problem resolution, emphasizing continuous improvement.

*   **Problem Awareness:** Recognizing the gap between a desired ideal state and the current reality, and actively working to close that gap. This involves continuously striving to raise your "quality threshold."

*   **Key Factors to Enhance Problem Solving:**
    1.  **Always ask "why":** This is the core of problem recognition. You cannot solve a problem you don't acknowledge.
    2.  **Develop an active attitude:** Approach problems with positive thinking and the ability to transform ideas. Be open to linking seemingly unrelated concepts for new solutions.
    3.  **Take ownership of your problems:** See problems as your responsibility and strive to resolve them. Avoid blaming others to effectively solve issues and grow professionally.

*   **Process:** Evaluates how well each factor (attribute of the object) meets the overall purpose, and reflects this in the final decision.

#### C. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
*   **Purpose:** A technique to make complex decisions by structuring information hierarchically.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Arrange decision information into a hierarchical tree.
    2.  Segment complex, non-quantifiable problems into smaller, understandable parts.
    3.  Evaluate segmented problems using pairwise comparisons.
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies complex problems, making elements easier for decision-makers to compare and judge.

### III. Essential Problem-Solving Skills

#### A. Definition
*   Problem-solving is the activity of recognizing and improving the gap between a desired state and the current state.
*   It requires continuously raising the "desired level" (quality threshold) through information collection and experience.

#### B. Key Factors to Improve Problem-Solving
1.  **Always Ask "Why":** Cultivate a strong sense of problem awareness by constantly questioning the root causes.
2.  **Develop an Active Attitude:** Embrace positive thinking and the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas to propose new solutions. Solutions rarely come from a single thought due to many variables.
3.  **Take Ownership:** See problems as your responsibility and be accountable for resolving them. Avoid blaming others ("passing the buck") to genuinely solve problems and grow professionally.

### IV. Business Communication & Documentation

#### A. Importance of Business Documents
*   Most business activities rely on documentation.
*   Effective document writing skills, combined with oral communication, are crucial for success, especially in today's complex business environment.
*   Ability to write concise and clear business documents is highly valued.

#### B. Concept of Business Documents

    *   **Clarity:** Use concise phrases and objective expressions, avoiding lengthy or emotional language.
    *   **Intuitiveness:** Should be easy for the reader to understand.

#### C. Types of Business Documents

1.  **General Document Types (Most Common)**
    *   **Reports:** For reporting on business feasibility, product/idea, or business environment.
    *   **Proposals:** To obtain approval for business promotion of a product or idea.
    *   **Business Plans:** To prepare a commercialization plan after product/idea approval.
    *   **Letters:** Used to evaluate the value of a product or idea.
    *   **Manuals:** Documents explaining the details of a plan or product.

2.  **Detailed Types of Reports**
    *   **Based on Nature:**
        *   **Situation-Describing Report:**
            *   **Purpose:** Explains a situation objectively.
            *   **Method:** Uses the 5WIH principle (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How).
            *   **Priority:** Speed and accuracy (e.g., status reports, situation reports).

### Section 3: Methods for Writing Effective Business Documents (Focus on One-Page Reports)

The "one-page report" is a widely used and adaptable format for various business documents.

#### 3.1 Key Message First, Details Attached
*   Summarize your core message or key opinions on the **first page**.
*   Attach supplementary explanations or supporting data as separate documents.
*   **Benefits**: Saves time for reviewers, reduces time spent creating lengthy initial reports.

#### 3.2 Structure with a Table of Contents & Keywords

1.  **Create a Table of Contents (TOC) First**: Don't skip this step. Brainstorm and organize your content logically.
    *   **Example TOC Order**: Purpose, Current Status/Issue, Direction/Improvement Plan, Budget, Decision-Making.
2.  **Use the 5W2HIT Principle for TOC Design**: A common framework for report content.
    *   **Why**: Reason, significance, background of the project.
    *   **What**: Content of the plan.
    *   **Target**: Goals, subject, target of planning.
    *   **How**: Method, means of promotion.
    *   **When**: Time and period of implementation/schedule.
    *   **Who**: Executioner, concerned person.
    *   **Where**: Target area, place.
    *   **How much**: Costs and benefits, budget, profit plan.
3.  **Condense Content to Keywords**:
    *   After drafting, summarize all details using only keywords.
    *   Remove elaborate or flowery language.
    *   **Example**: "It's a very wonderful and beautiful night." becomes "Beautiful night."
    *   **Example**: "Company XX spent a lot of money and did not achieve what it wanted..." becomes "Company XX failed to achieve its goals despite excessive spending."

#### 3.3 Clarify Your Conclusion
*   Poor reports often describe problems without clear solutions.
*   **Always clarify your thesis and conclusions.**
*   Specifically answer "How are you going to do it?" for managers/stakeholders.

#### 3.4 Use Tables Effectively
*   Tables are excellent for summarizing large amounts of information on one page.
*   Combine narrative sentences with tables for optimal clarity and conciseness.

#### 3.5 Write Strong Titles
*   **Purpose**: Allows readers (especially busy executives) to immediately grasp the content, purpose, and nature of the report.
*   **Guidelines**:
    *   **Concise**: Ideally under 20 characters.
    *   **Specific**: Include year, nature of the document.
    *   **Action-Oriented Keywords**: Use words like "review," "improvement (proposal)," "status," "minutes."
    *   **Subtitles**: Use punctuation (-, ()) for longer titles to add specific detail.
*   **Example (Well-written)**: "2009 Evaluation System Improvement Plan (Focusing on Improvement of Performance Evaluation System)"
*   **Example (Poorly written)**: "Evaluation/Compensation System Improvement Plan"

#### 3.6 Include Date and Author (Organizer)

This guide covers key principles for effective project documentation, one-page reports, and official letters.

---

### **Part 1: Effective Project Planning & Reporting**

#### **1. The 5W2HIT Framework (Project Planning)**
A structured approach to project planning:
*   **Why:** Reason, significance, background of the project.
*   **What:** Content of the plan, what will be done.
*   **Target:** Goals, subject, or audience of the project.
*   **How:** Method and means of promotion/execution.
*   **When:** Schedule and timeframe for implementation.
*   **Who:** Executioner(s) or responsible parties.
*   **Where:** Target area or location of performance.
*   **How Much:** Costs, benefits, budget, and profit plan.

#### **2. Principles of Concise Reporting**
*   **Keywords:** Summarize content using keywords; remove elaborate words.
*   **Conciseness:** Get straight to the point. Example:
    *   *Instead of:* "It's a very wonderful and beautiful night."
    *   *Use:* "Beautiful night."
    *   *Instead of:* "Company XX spent a lot of money and did not achieve what it wanted..."
    *   *Use:* "Company XX failed to achieve goals despite excessive spending."
*   **Clarify Conclusions:**
    *   State your thesis and conclusions clearly.
    *   Always answer: "How are you going to do it?" for managers/stakeholders.
*   **Use Tables Effectively:** Tables help summarize large amounts of information on a single page, complementing narrative sentences.

#### **3. Writing Report Titles**
A good title allows immediate understanding of the report's content, purpose, and nature.
*   **Identify Content:** Title should instantly convey the document's subject.
*   **Conciseness:** Aim for titles under 20 characters for quick grasp.
*   **Keywords:** Use specific words to indicate the document's nature (e.g., "review," "improvement proposal," "status," "minutes").
*   **Subtitles:** Use punctuation (-, ()) for more specific details if the main title is long.

**Examples:**
*   **Well-written:**
    *   "2009 Evaluation System Improvement Plan (Focusing on Performance Evaluation)"
    *   "Status of EA Introduction by High Performing Companies"
    *   "Minutes of ERP Introduction Meeting (1st)"
*   **Poorly written:**
    *   "Evaluation/Compensation System Improvement Plan"
    *   "Department Meeting Minutes"
    *   "EA introduction status"

#### **4. Report Logistics**
*   **Date and Organizer (Author):**
    *   **Location:** Indicate at the bottom right of the title.
    *   **Importance:** Provides a basis for document identification and prevents version confusion.
*   **Numbering:**
    *   **Organizational Standard:** Prioritize any specific numbering method set by your organization.
    *   **Common Methods:** If no standard, use common systems.
    *   **General Reports:** Often use numbers for main headings and figures (letters, Roman numerals, etc.) for subheadings.
    *   **Regulations/Policies:** May use code formulas (e.g., <Type 1>).
    *   **Official Letters/Poems:** May use mixed numbers and letters.

    **Common Numbering Examples:**
    *   **Type A:**
        1.  Main Heading
            a. Subheading
                i. Sub-subheading
    *   **Type B:**
        1.  Main Heading
            1.1 Subheading
                1.1.1 Sub-subheading

#### **5. Detailed Writing Method for One-Page Reports (By Item)**
Follow this structure for comprehensive one-page reports:

*   **Purpose:**
    *   One to two sentences explaining *why* the work is done or *why* the proposal is made.
*   **Status/Issue:**
    *   Describe the current situation and identify the problem/cause.
    *   Crucial for improvement-focused plans.
*   **Improvement Plan:**
    *   Present solutions to the identified problems.
    *   **Tip:** Use tables to compare different plans (e.g., Plan 1 vs. Plan 2), detailing content, strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Schedule:**
    *   Organize and describe the timeline and major milestones for each item of the plan.
*   **Attachment:**
    *   If attachments exist, list and number them (e.g., "1. Reward Recipient List (1 copy)").
*   **End:**
    *   Mark "End" to signify the document's completion.
    *   **Placement:**
        *   No attachment: Two spaces after the last letter of the document.
        *   Last part is a table: Bottom left of the table.
        *   With attachment: Two spaces after the last letter of the attachment.

**Example One-Page Report Structure (Content Types):**
*   **Title:** [e.g., Knowledge History Management System Establishment Plan]
*   **Reporting Department:** [e.g., Human Resources/e-Management Team]
*   **Related Department:** [e.g., Technology Strategy Team]
*   **Date:** [YY-MM-DD]
    1.  **Purpose:** (e.g., Maximize HR efficiency, support decision-making)
    2.  **Status/Issue:** (e.g., Insufficient knowledge history management, difficulty finding experts)
    3.  **System Construction Plan:**
        *   **Overview:** (e.g., Establish database integrating personal histories, skills, experiences)
        *   **Main Functions:** (Table: Classification, Content - e.g., Knowledge history management, Career/Skill analysis, Experience sharing, Career goal management)
    4.  **Establishment Process:** (e.g., Timeline of steps: Research, System Design, Development, Initiation, Establishment)

### 5. Executing the Presentation

Effective execution is crucial, as the presenter's ability often outweighs material quality.

#### Pre-Presentation Checklist:
*   **Venue Inspection:** Visit the site, visualize the audience, simulate your movement, gestures, and do a quick practice.
*   **Material Familiarity:** Know your presentation flow well. Avoid reading directly, maintain eye contact, and project confidence.
*   **Engaging Opening:** Start with an interesting story or comment (e.g., weather, current issues) to build rapport and audience interest. Avoid immediately diving into the topic.
*   **Material Review (Technical):** Check for errors. Bring your own laptop if possible, as display may vary with different software versions or fonts.
*   **Key Points & Examples:** Re-check key points for each slide and ensure examples enhance understanding. Use presentation tools effectively or prepare a simple cue sheet.
*   **Impressive Closing:** Prepare a closing comment that leaves a lasting message. Use quotes, aphorisms, or inspiring words linked to your topic to make it memorable.

#### Effective Body Language:
According to **The Law of Mehrabian**, only 7% of communication impact comes from logical explanation, while **93% is non-verbal** (gestures, tone of voice, facial expressions). Your body language, including your voice, is powerful.

*   **Personal Appearance & Image:**
    *   Maintain a neat appearance, hairstyle, and attire to build trust.
    *   Smile! A gloomy or stiff expression creates a negative image.
*   **Eye Contact:**
    *   Maintain clear, bright eye contact to appear confident and trustworthy.
    *   Crucial for connecting with the audience. Focus ~60% on key decision-makers and ~40% on the rest of the audience.
    *   Observe reactions and build connection.
*   **Voice:**
    *   Speak with correct pronunciation and an appropriate, resonant speed.
    *   Vary your speed (slow, fast, pauses) to keep the audience immersed and emphasize points.
*   **Appropriate Motion:**
    *   Use body language to emphasize important points.
    *   Avoid exaggerated motions; use proper hand movements at the right time.
*   **Gestures for Emphasis:**
    *   Coordinate gestures with your voice. It's more effective to gesture *at the same time* or *slightly before* you speak an important point, rather than afterward.
    *   Combine eye contact with hand gestures while speaking.

*   **Challenges with Agile:** Difficult to apply in highly vertical organizational structures or where there are significant power imbalances (e.g., between client and supplier).

### 2. The Project Life Cycle

**Overview:**
*   A project's life cycle is the period from its initiation to its closing.
*   It typically involves five distinct process groups. If a project stops mid-way, the closing process is initiated immediately.

**The Five Project Management Process Groups:**

1.  **Initiating Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Formally starting the project.
    *   **Activities:** Formal project initiation, stakeholder identification, project manager appointment, project charter development.
2.  **Planning Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Defining how project goals will be achieved and deliverables created.
    *   **Activities:** All activities involved in planning to meet project objectives.
3.  **Executing Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Carrying out the work defined in the project management plan.
    *   **Activities:** Completing the tasks outlined in the project plan.
4.  **Monitoring & Controlling Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Tracking project performance and progress, making adjustments as needed.
    *   **Activities:** Continuous oversight throughout the project life cycle, ensuring alignment with the plan and making corrective actions.
5.  **Closing Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Formally completing all project activities.
    *   **Activities:** Finalizing all tasks, including contractual obligations, to officially close the project.

**Project Life Cycle Management (PLCM):**
*   Approaches project management using a **systems engineering model**.
*   Involves dividing the project life cycle into detailed stages.
*   Systematically manages **inputs, technologies, tools, and outputs** for each stage to facilitate overall project management.
*   **Life Cycle:** Describes the general steps.
*   **Methodology:** Provides concrete specifications (inputs, tools, outputs) for each step.

**Types of Project Life Cycles:**

1.  **Predictive Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Planning-focused. Project scope, schedule, and cost are largely determined at the project's beginning based on past experience.
    *   **Application:** Suited for projects with established technology or extensive experience, like product development or architectural projects.
    *   **Process:** The entire project scope is defined at the start, and execution follows a pre-defined plan.

2.  **Iterative Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** The final product is developed by dividing it into parts and repeatedly developing those parts.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Incremental Life Cycle:** Project scope is broken into multiple phases. Activities within these phases run in parallel, overlapping and repeating, delivering functional parts of the product gradually.
        *   **Evolutionary Life Cycle:** The project is divided into phases, with each iteration building upon and refining the previous one sequentially towards the final product.

3.  **Adaptive Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** An **Agile process** designed to react quickly to external changes.
    *   **Purpose:** To flexibly respond to evolving requirements, maximizing project value in dynamic environments.

### 3. Project Planning and Initiation (Before Contract)

**Stages Before Project Contract and Commencement:**
1.  **Planning Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Preliminary work such as feasibility analysis and budget planning for the project.
2.  **Acquisition Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Defining the project scope, preparing and issuing a **Request For Proposal (RFP)** to potential vendors, and optionally holding an RFP briefing.
3.  **Contracting Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Evaluating submitted proposals, selecting a business operator, conducting technical negotiations, and finalizing the contract.

**Key Considerations for New Project Planning:**
*   Ensure the project or program aligns with the organization's enterprise-wide strategic goals and portfolio.
*   Review the high-level plan for integration with any relevant existing management programs.

**Importance of Early Planning (Project Cost/Efforts Curve):**
*   **Crucial Principle:** Spending sufficient time on planning in the early stages helps avoid significant confusion and problems later in the project.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Allows prediction of various risks and issues.
    *   Enables establishing response plans in advance.
    *   Sets up processes for handling unexpected problems effectively.
*   **Consequences of Poor Planning:** Neglecting initial planning and rushing into execution can lead to rapid progress at first, but exponentially increasing confusion and potential project failure in later stages.

**The Proposal Process (Developer's Perspective):**
*   **Proposal:** A document submitted by a potential supplier (developer) to a client (acquirer) in response to an RFP.
*   **Purpose:** To win the project contract.
*   **Content:** Typically includes a proposal outline, introduction to the proposing company, and details on project execution and management.
*   **Outcome:** After proposal evaluation, if selected as the preferred bidder, a contract is concluded through technical negotiation, and the project officially begins.

# Project Management & Technical Communication: Learning Guide

## 1. Project Life Cycles

Project life cycles describe how a project progresses from start to finish. There are three main types:

### A) Predictive Life Cycle (Waterfall)
*   **Description:** The entire project scope, schedule, and cost are defined upfront at the beginning. Activities are carried out according to a detailed plan.
*   **Best For:** Projects with mature technology or extensive experience.

### B) Iterative Life Cycle
*   **Description:** A product is developed in parts, repeatedly, to complete the final product.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Incremental Life Cycle:** Project scope is divided into multiple phases. Activities in these phases run in parallel and overlap gradually.
    *   **Evolutionary Life Cycle:** Project is divided into several phases, and each iteration proceeds sequentially.

### C) Adaptive Life Cycle (Agile)
*   **Description:** An agile process that responds quickly to external changes. Its purpose is to flexibly adapt to changing requirements to maximize project value.

## 2. Project Initiation: Planning & Execution Stages

Before a project is contracted and started, it typically goes through specific stages:

### A) Key Stages
1.  **Planning Stage:**
    *   Preliminary work like feasibility analysis and budget planning.
2.  **Acquisition Stage:**
    *   Scope definition.
    *   **RFP (Request For Proposal):** A document issued to solicit proposals from potential vendors.
    *   RFP briefing (if necessary).
3.  **Contracting Stage:**
    *   Evaluation of submitted proposals.
    *   Selection of the business operator (vendor).
    *   Technical negotiations and final contracting.

### B) Importance of Early Planning (Project Cost/Efforts Curve)
*   **Concept:** Spending adequate time on planning in the early stages helps avoid confusion and exponentially increasing costs/efforts later in the project.
*   **Benefit:** Allows for predicting risks, establishing response plans, and handling unexpected problems effectively.
*   **Risk of Poor Planning:** Jumping directly into execution with a poor initial plan can lead to rapid progress initially but cause significant confusion and cost increases later.

### C) The Proposal Process (Developer's View)
*   **Purpose:** To win a project contract based on the acquirer's RFP.
*   **Content:** Outlines the proposal, introduces the proposing company, and details project execution and management.
*   **Process:** Developers submit a proposal, which is evaluated. If selected as the preferred bidder, a contract is concluded after technical negotiation, and the project begins.

## 3. Project Management Methodologies

Common structured approaches to managing projects:

### A) PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
*   **Origin:** Published by PMI (Project Management Institute), a US non-profit.

---

### Section 3: Scope Management - Deep Dive

#### A. Recent Trends & Major Issues
*   **Biggest Cause of Project Failure:** Scope change due to repetitive requirements changes.
*   **Impact:** Leads to schedule delays and higher costs (e.g., overtime).
*   **Solution:** Effective scope management process is crucial for success.

#### B. Key Concepts
*   **Scope Management Process Steps:**
    1.  Scope Management Plan Formation
    2.  Requirements Collection
    3.  Scope Definition
    4.  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Creation
    5.  Scope Validation

*   **WBS Components:** Work Package, Code of Account, WBS Dictionary

#### C. Understanding Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
*   **Common Misconception:** WBS is often mistaken as a schedule management tool (because work packages have start/end dates and tools like MS Project integrate it with scheduling).
*   **Clarification:** WBS is a **deliverable of Scope Management**, explicitly defined in PMBOK's "Create WBS" process.
*   **Why the Distinction Matters:** WBS plays a critical role in managing scope changes. When requirements change, WBS is the first place to look, allowing comprehensive management of related impacts on schedule, cost, and quality.
*   **Focus:** Use WBS as a tool for **scope management**.

#### D. Concept of Scope Management
*   **Importance:** It's one of the three most important knowledge areas for project success.
*   **Purpose:** Since projects are unique, temporary, and goal-driven, clear goals and scope are essential.
*   **Project Manager's Role:** Clarify and define the work scope—what needs to be done, and what is unnecessary, even if requested.
*   **Definition of Scope:**
    *   "The sum of products and services provided through the project."
    *   The range of work required to successfully complete the project.
*   **Types of Scope:**
    1.  **Project Scope:**
        *   **Definition:** All the work required to create products, services, and outputs with specified features/functions.
        *   **Focus:** The "HOW" aspect – how products and services are provided.
        *   **Completion Measured By:** Project plan.
    2.  **Product Scope:**
        *   **Definition:** The features and functions of the product or service itself.
        *   **Focus:** The "WHAT" aspect – what the product/service is.
        *   **Completion Measured By:** Product requirements.
*   **Equation:** Scope = Project Scope + Product Scope

#### E. Scope Management Process (Detailed Steps)

The scope management process follows a specific order:

1.  **Scope Management Planning**
    *   **Concept:** Developing a Project Scope Management Plan to define, confirm, and control the project scope.
    *   **Project Scope Management Plan Content:**
        *   Procedure to describe project scope.
        *   How to formulate the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
        *   Verification and validation criteria for deliverables.
        *   Format and procedure for requesting scope changes.
    *   **Key Requirement:** The plan must be shared between the client and the service provider.

2.  **Collect Requirements**
    *   **Importance:** Crucial to understand *what* the customer needs and, more importantly, *why* they need it.
    *   **Example (F-16 Fighter Jet):**
        *   Initial Requirement: Mach 2.5 speed.
        *   Underlying Need (Why?): Improve engagement capabilities.
        *   Solution: Designer focused on maneuverability (fly-by-wire, integrated canopy, digital avionics) instead of just speed, successfully meeting the *true* requirement.
        *   *Contrast (Soviet Jets):* Focus solely on "fastest in world" (Mach 3.25) led to an expensive, short-lived, and ineffective combat aircraft.
    *   **Lesson:** Prioritize understanding the root need over literal stated requirements.

## Project Scope Management & WBS Learning Guide

### Introduction: Understanding WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)

*   **Common Misconception:** WBS is often mistakenly seen as a schedule management tool.
*   **Reality:** WBS is a **deliverable of scope management**, as defined by PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) from PMI (Project Management Institute).
*   **Why it Matters:** WBS plays a crucial role in managing scope changes (e.g., new or changed requirements). Using it for scope changes helps manage related elements like schedule, cost, and quality simultaneously.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Use WBS primarily as a **scope management tool**.

### Section 1: Concept of Scope Management

*   **What is Project Scope Management?**
    *   One of the three important knowledge areas in project management.
    *   Essential for project success, as projects are unique, temporary, and goal-driven.
    *   Involves clearly defining what needs to be done and excluding anything unnecessary, even if requested by the client.
*   **What is "Scope"?**
    *   The total sum of products and services provided through the project, or the total work required to successfully complete it.
    *   **Two Types of Scope:**
        *   **Project Scope (The HOW):** All the work required to create the specified products, services, and outputs.
            *   **Completion Measured By:** Project plan.
        *   **Product Scope (The WHAT):** The features and functions of the product, service, or output itself.
            *   **Completion Measured By:** Product requirements.

### Section 2: Scope Management Process

The scope management process follows these six steps:

1.  **Scope Management Planning**
2.  **Requirements Collection**
3.  **Scope Definition**
4.  **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Formulation**
5.  **Scope Validation**
6.  **Scope Control**

### Section 3: Detailed Process Steps

#### 1. Scope Management Planning

*   **Purpose:** To develop the **Project Scope Management Plan**. This plan defines how the project scope will be defined, confirmed, and controlled.
*   **Key Contents of the Plan:**
    *   Procedure for describing the project scope.
    *   How the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be formulated.
    *   Criteria for verifying and validating deliverables.
    *   Format and procedure for requesting scope changes.
*   **Important:** This plan must be shared and agreed upon by both the client and the service provider.

#### 2. Requirements Collection

*   **Objective:** To understand not only *what* the customer needs, but more importantly, *why* they need it.
*   **Benefit:** Understanding the "why" helps avoid unnecessary development and focuses resources on truly important aspects. (e.g., F-16 example: improving maneuverability for engagement capabilities vs. chasing raw speed).
*   **Common Techniques:**
    *   **Interview:** Systematic oral discussions with individuals or groups to gather requirements.
    *   **Prototyping:** Quickly building a partial or full system model to get user understanding and feedback.
    *   **Moderator Meeting (Facilitated Workshop):** A group discussion guided by a moderator to generate ideas for products, services, or improvements.
    *   **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documents (e.g., business plans, market research, contracts, RFPs, SOWs, old system designs) to identify system requirements.

#### 3. Scope Definition

*   **Purpose:** To identify the project's key scope after requirements collection and formulate detailed scope statements for both the project and its products. This ensures a common understanding of business functions.
*   **Scope Statement:** This document specifies the criteria for outputs and delivery, including characteristics like exclusions, constraints, and assumptions. It clearly defines the project boundaries.
*   **Requirements for a Good Scope Definition:**
    *   **Clear Scope:** Must be unambiguously defined, preventing different interpretations. It's fundamental for other requirements.
    *   **Complete Scope:** Should have no missing, excessive, or overlapping parts.
    *   **Agreed-upon Scope:** All stakeholders must reach a consensus on the scope *before* project execution to avoid issues later.
    *   **Manageable Scope:** The scope must be defined in a way that allows for easy integration with other plans (like schedule and budget) using the WBS framework.
        *   **Specifically, manageable means:**
            *   Duration and cost can be accurately estimated.
            *   A person in charge can be designated.
            *   Performance can be realistically evaluated.

#### 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Formulation

*   **What it is:** The WBS is created by breaking down project deliverables and the entire scope into smaller, more manageable components.
*   **Importance:** This is considered a critical activity not just for scope management, but for the entire project.
*   **Benefits:** Helps prevent missing tasks, clarifies relationships between tasks, and enables consistent communication with stakeholders and sponsors.

#### 5. Scope Validation

*   **Purpose:** To formally confirm and gain approval from the client or project leader for the completed project deliverables.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Inspection:** Measuring, examining, and confirming performance to ensure tasks and deliverables meet requirements and delivery criteria (e.g., conducting Reviews and Walkthroughs).
    *   Technical review by the project team to identify any defects, specifications, or standards issues.

#### 6. Scope Control

*   **Purpose:** To monitor the status of the project and product scope, managing any changes according to formal procedures.
*   **Key Aspects:**
    *   Ensures all requested changes, recommended corrective actions, and preventive actions are processed throughout the project.
    *   Scope changes are frequent and often impact schedule and cost.
    *   All scope changes must be reported to the **Project Change Control Board (CCB)**, their impacts reviewed, and formally approved.

### Section 4: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - Detailed

#### A. Concept of WBS

*   **Definition:** A hierarchical structure of tasks, classified by project deliverables, and broken down into manageable packages.
*   **Work Package:** The lowest-level subtask item within the WBS.
    *   **Example:** For an "online bulletin board" project, work packages could be "Write text," "Delete text," "Edit text," and "File upload."
*   **Structure:** Most commonly represented as a **tree diagram**, which clearly shows parent-to-child relationships and hierarchy for intuitive understanding.

#### B. Components of WBS

*   **Work Package:**
    *   The lowest-level unit of the WBS.
    *   For this unit, cost and duration can be planned, estimated, monitored, and controlled.
*   **Code of Account:**
    *   A unique identification or numbering system assigned to each work package in the WBS.
*   **WBS Dictionary:**
    *   A detailed description for each work package.
    *   Includes an outline of the work, schedule, person in charge, and budget.
*   **RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix):**
    *   A standard that defines who is responsible for each element.
    *   Specifies roles like the approver at each stage, quality reviewer, and input manager.

    *   Identifies approvers, quality reviewers, and input managers.

**F. How to Create a WBS (Principles):**
*   WBS is created by breaking down the scope statement into small, manageable work packages.
1.  **Deliverable-based:** Focus on tangible deliverables to effectively control and manage scope.
2.  **Detailed Segmentation:**
    *   The lowest WBS unit typically has a duration of **~80 hours (2 weeks)** for effective performance control.
    *   Units should be processable by project members within 1-2 weeks.
3.  **Hierarchical Representation:** Defined to clearly show sequential relationships or correlations between WBS elements.

### III. Schedule Management Fundamentals

**A. Importance of Schedule Management:**
*   Projects have a "fixed timeline" or "delivery date."
*   Requires efficient work and minimizing errors to meet deadlines.
*   Delays can lead to "project failure."

**B. Recent Trends & Key Issue (Resource Capacity):**
*   Overconfidence in resource capacity often leads to project delays.
*   Project schedules **must** be based on realistic scope requirements and available resource capacity.

## Project Schedule Management: Learning Guide (Pages 91-95)

### 1. Core Concept & Importance

*   **Problem**: Overconfidence in resources leads to project delays and missed deadlines.
*   **Solution**: Project schedules must be realistic, based on the project's **scope** and available **resource capacity**.
*   **Goal**: Systematically manage the project timeline to ensure completion on time.

### 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1.  Explain the concept and process of schedule management.
2.  Understand schedule management techniques.
3.  Identify schedule compression techniques (Crashing, Fast Tracking - mentioned as keywords, but not detailed in this extract).

### 3. Key Terminology

*   **Schedule Management Process**: Planning, activity definition, activity sequencing, activity resource estimation, activity duration estimation, schedule development, schedule control.

*   **Schedule Management Techniques**: Critical Path Method (CPM), Critical Chain Method (CCM).
*   **Compression Techniques**: Crashing, Fast Tracking.
*   **Schedule**: A display of activity start and finish dates, derived from analyzing durations, relationships, resources, costs, and uncertainties. More than a simple timetable.
*   **Sprint**: In Agile, a short, iterative development cycle for a part of the project.
*   **Retrospective**: A meeting at the end of a sprint to discuss progress and adjust future plans.

### 4. Why Schedule Management Matters

*   Projects have a definite **start and end date** (delivery date).
*   Systematic schedule management helps prevent project failure due to delays.
*   It breaks down projects into smaller, manageable units, allowing for iterative adjustment.
*   **Benefits of a well-written schedule**:
    *   **Feasible Planning**: Sets realistic timelines.
    *   **Project Overview**: Provides a complete picture for the team and stakeholders (clients, management).
    *   **Effective Control**: Identifies areas needing focused management.
    *   **Clear Communication**: Conveys a lot of project information efficiently.

### 5. Modern Approaches: Agile Process

*   Driven by intense market competition and diverse technical development.
*   **Agile Process** (e.g., XP, Scrum) uses rapid, iterative development.
*   **Sprints**: Short development cycles for parts of the project, repeated to increase completion.
*   **Retrospective**: A procedure at the end of each sprint for team communication and realistic adjustment of future plans.

### 6. Understanding the Project Schedule

*   **What is a Schedule?**
    *   A visual representation (tables, graphs, network diagrams) of project activities' start and finish dates.
    *   It's based on comprehensive analysis of activity duration, dependencies, resources (human/physical), costs, project uncertainty, and working conditions.
    *   **Distinction**: A schedule is *not* a simple timetable; it logically links factors affecting project time and cost.

*   **Common Schedule Formats**:
    *   **Network Schedule**:
        *   Illustrates relationships between activities.
        *   Used for project planning.
        *   Good for showing individual activity progress.
    *   **Gantt Chart**:
        *   Mainly for reporting to management.
        *   Shows when milestones are executed.
    *   **Milestone Chart**:
        *   Simplest form, suitable for high-level reporting (clients, management).
        *   Focuses on important project checkpoints (milestones) with zero duration.

### 7. Schedule Management Process

Schedule management involves a series of steps to plan and control the project timeline:

1.  **Schedule Management Planning**:
    *   Develop a **Project Schedule Management Plan**.
    *   This detailed plan is created by sharing project approval, project management plan, and rules for measuring the schedule with the team.
    *   It's a crucial document; any changes require approval from the project steering committee and must be recorded.

2.  **Activity Definition**:
    *   Identify and document all activities needed to create project deliverables.
    *   Based on project scope and requirements.
    *   Activities are refined iteratively through **Rolling Wave Planning** and **Work Breakdown System (WBS)**.

3.  **Activity Sequencing**:
    *   Arrange defined activities in a logical order by identifying relationships between them.
    *   **Logical Relationships between Activities**:
        *   **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Successor activity cannot start until predecessor activity finishes. (Most common)
            *   *Example: Develop product AFTER screen design finishes.*
        *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Successor activity cannot finish until predecessor activity finishes.
            *   *Example: Analysis finishes ONLY when writing AND deletion of text finish.*
        *   **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Successor activity cannot start until predecessor activity starts.
            *   *Example: Development activities can start ONLY when planning begins.*
        *   **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Successor activity cannot finish until predecessor activity starts.
            *   *Example: In 3-shift work, Shift B (successor) can leave only when Shift A (predecessor) comes to work.*

4.  **Activity Duration Estimation**:
    *   Estimate the time required for each activity, considering allocated resources.
    *   **Estimation Methods**:
        *   **Expert Judgment**: An expert uses experience from similar projects to estimate resources and duration.
        *   **Analogous Estimating**: Refers to similar past projects for estimation (less accurate than parametric methods, but good when data is limited).
        *   **Three-point Estimating**: A risk-based technique, especially useful with limited experience. It uses three estimates:
            *   **Optimistic (O)**: Best-case scenario, shortest duration.
            *   **Most Likely (M)**: Realistic estimate, average duration.
            *   **Pessimistic (P)**: Worst-case scenario, longest duration.
            *   **Calculation Formula (from PERT)**: `(O + 4M + P) / 6`
            *   *Example: If O=4 days, M=6 days, P=10 days, then Duration = (4 + 4*6 + 10) / 6 = 6.3 days.*
            *   **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**: The technique behind three-point estimation. It predicts project schedule while considering various risk factors and fluctuations.

5.  **Schedule Development**:
    *   Create the final project schedule by combining and analyzing activity sequences, estimated durations, resource needs, and any schedule constraints.

6.  **Schedule Control**: (Mentioned as a process step, but details are not provided in this extract).
    *   This involves monitoring project status, managing changes to the schedule, and influencing factors that create schedule changes.

# Project Schedule Management: Learning Guide

This guide covers the essential concepts and processes of project schedule management.

## 1. Introduction to Project Schedule Management

*   **Goal:** To complete a project within the time agreed with the client.
*   **Approach:**
    *   If the finish date is pre-determined: Planning is "top-down," where activities are adjusted to fit the timeline.
    *   **Key Principle:** Project schedules must be **feasible**, considering the project scale and available resources. Avoid neglecting activity relationships or arbitrary stage weighting, which can lead to problems.

## 2. The Schedule Management Process

This process involves several interconnected steps:

1.  **Schedule Management Planning**
2.  **Activity Definition**
3.  **Activity Sequencing**
4.  **Activity Duration Estimation**
5.  **Schedule Development**
6.  **Schedule Control**

*(Note: In PMBOK 6th edition, "Activity Resource Estimation" is now part of Resource Management.)*

### 2.1. Schedule Management Planning

*   **Action:** Formulate a **Project Schedule Management Plan**.
*   **Detailing:** Share the project management plan, approval details, and rules for measuring the schedule with the team.
*   **Control:** This plan is crucial for quality control. Any changes to the confirmed schedule require approval from the project steering committee and the plan must be updated.

### 2.2. Activity Definition

*   **Action:** Identify and document all activities necessary to produce project deliverables.
*   **Basis:** Project scope and requirements.
*   **Method:** Since it's hard to define everything upfront, activities are refined incrementally using:
    *   **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposing project work into smaller, manageable components.
    *   **Rolling Wave Planning:** Detailing activities only as they become clearer and closer in the project lifecycle.

### 2.3. Activity Sequencing

*   **Action:** Identify relationships between defined activities and connect them in a logical order.
*   **Logical Relationship Types:**
    *   **Finish-to-Start (FS):** A successor activity cannot start until its predecessor activity has finished.
        *   *(Most common.)* Example: Develop product **after** screen design finishes.
    *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** A successor activity cannot finish until its predecessor activity has finished.
        *   Example: Analysis **completes only when** writing and deleting text are completed.
    *   **Start-to-Start (SS):** A successor activity cannot start until its predecessor activity has started.
        *   Example: Development activities **can start only when** planning begins.
    *   **Start-to-Finish (SF):** A successor activity cannot finish until its predecessor activity has started.
        *   Example: In a 3-shift system, a worker (successor) can leave **only when** the next worker (predecessor) arrives.

### 2.4. Activity Duration Estimation

*   **Action:** Estimate the time required to perform each activity with allocated resources.
*   **Estimation Methods:**
    *   **Expert Judgment:** Rely on internal or external experts with similar project experience.
    *   **Analogous Estimating:** Use data from similar past projects to estimate the current one. *(A risk-based technique.)*
    *   **Three-point Estimating:** Estimates duration using three values, especially useful when experience is limited or risks are high.
        *   **Optimistic (O):** Best-case scenario, shortest duration.
        *   **Most Likely (M):** Realistic or average duration.
        *   **Pessimistic (P):** Worst-case scenario, longest duration.
        *   **Formula (Beta Average):** `(O + 4M + P) / 6`
        *   **Origin:** Derived from **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**, a technique developed in 1958 for complex projects, which helps predict schedules considering risks and fluctuations.

### 2.5. Schedule Development

*   **Action:** Create the overall project schedule.
*   **Process:** Combine the sequenced activities, their estimated durations, resource requirements, and any schedule constraints. A common tool for visualization is a **Gantt Chart**.

### 2.6. Schedule Control

*   **Action:** Monitor the status of project activities and manage changes to ensure the schedule stays on track.
*   **Key Focus Areas (General):**
    *   Determine the current status of the schedule.
    *   Adjust factors causing schedule changes.
    *   Identify if the schedule has actually changed.
    *   Manage approved changes.
*   **Key Focus Areas (Agile Methodology):**
    *   Compare work completed against estimated work in a given time period.
    *   Perform **retrospective reviews** to learn from the process and make improvements.
    *   **Reprioritize remaining tasks (backlog).**
    *   Determine **velocity** (the rate at which deliverables are produced, verified, and accepted per iteration, e.g., every two weeks or month).
    *   Manage actual changes.

## 3. Schedule Management Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)

### 3.1. What is CPM?

*   **Definition:** A network analysis technique used to determine the **minimum duration** required to complete a project.
*   **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that determines the project's overall minimum duration. These activities have **"Zero" float**, meaning any delay to them will delay the entire project.
*   **Inputs:** Project Schedule Network Diagram, activity sequences, durations, dependencies, leads, and delays.
*   **Analysis:** Involves **Forward Pass** and **Backward Pass** calculations.

### 3.2. Key Components of CPM

*   **Forward Pass:** Calculates the earliest possible dates for activities.
    *   **Early Start (ES):** The earliest date an activity can possibly begin.
    *   **Early Finish (EF):** The earliest date an activity can possibly finish.
*   **Backward Pass:** Calculates the latest possible dates for activities without delaying the project.
    *   **Late Start (LS):** The latest date an activity can start without delaying the project's finish.
    *   **Late Finish (LF):** The latest date an activity can finish without delaying the project's finish.
*   **Total Float (Slack):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed or extended without delaying the project's overall finish date.
    *   **Formula:** `Total Float = Late Finish (LF) - Early Finish (EF)`
    *   **Formula:** `Total Float = Late Start (LS) - Early Start (ES)`

### 3.3. CPM Example Setup (Conceptual)

To calculate a schedule using CPM:

1.  List all project activities, their durations, and their predecessor activities.
2.  Draw a network diagram, visually linking activities based on their sequential relationships.
3.  Place the activity name and its duration on the diagram.
    *   For example, if Activity B has a predecessor Activity A, B is placed after A, with its duration noted.
4.  Once the diagram is complete, perform Forward and Backward Pass calculations to identify ES, EF, LS, LF, and Total Float for each activity, ultimately revealing the critical path.

## Learning Guide: Schedule Management Techniques

### 1. Introduction to Schedule Management

Effective schedule management ensures projects are completed on time. Key activities include:
*   **Reprioritizing tasks** in the project backlog as needed.
*   **Determining the rate** at which deliverables are produced and accepted per work cycle (e.g., two weeks, one month).
*   **Monitoring project schedule changes.**
*   **Managing actual changes** that occur.

### 2. Schedule Development Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)

CPM is a network analysis technique used to determine the **minimum duration** required to complete a project. It identifies the "critical path" – the longest sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to finish by its earliest date.

#### Key Concepts in CPM:

*   **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that, if delayed, will delay the entire project. It's identified by activities with **Zero Total Float**.
*   **Forward Pass:** Calculates the earliest possible start and finish dates for activities.
    *   **Early Start (ES):** The earliest date an activity can begin.
    *   **Early Finish (EF):** The earliest date an activity can finish.
*   **Backward Pass:** Calculates the latest possible start and finish dates for activities without delaying the project.
    *   **Late Start (LS):** The latest date an activity can start without delaying the project's finish date.
    *   **Late Finish (LF):** The latest date an activity can finish without delaying the project's finish date.
*   **Total Float (TF):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed or extended without delaying the project's overall finish date.
    *   **Formula:** `TF = LF - EF` or `TF = LS - ES`

#### Steps to Perform CPM:

**Input:** A Project Schedule Network Diagram showing activity sequence, duration, dependencies, leads, and lags.

**Example Activities:**

| Activity Name | Duration | Predecessor Activity |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------- |
| A             | 3 days   | -                    |
| B             | 2 days   | A                    |
| C             | 2 days   | B, D                 |
| D             | 4 days   | A                    |
| E             | 6 days   | D                    |
| F             | 3 days   | E                    |

**1. Activity Definition & Duration Estimation:**
*   List all project activities.
*   Estimate duration for each.
*   Identify predecessor activities (what must finish before this can start).
*   Draw a network diagram linking activities based on their sequential relationships.

    *(Example diagram for Activities A-F)*
    ```
    (A) --- (B) --- (C)
     |       /
     |      /
     (D) --- (E) --- (F)
    ```

**2. Forward Scheduling (Calculate ES & EF):**
*   **Purpose:** Determine the earliest possible start and finish for each activity.
*   **Formulas:**
    *   `ES = (EF of immediate predecessor activity) + 1`
    *   `EF = ES of activity + activity duration - 1`
*   **Rule for Multiple Predecessors:** If an activity has multiple predecessors, its ES is calculated using the **latest** EF of all its immediate predecessors.
*   **Starting Point:** For the first activity(ies) with no predecessors, ES starts at 1.

| Activity Name | ES             | Duration | EF             |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| A             | 1              | 3        | 3 (1+3-1)      |
| B             | 4 (EF of A + 1)| 2        | 5 (4+2-1)      |
| C             | 8 (EF of D + 1)*| 2        | 9 (8+2-1)      |
| D             | 4 (EF of A + 1)| 4        | 7 (4+4-1)      |
| E             | 8 (EF of D + 1)| 6        | 13 (8+6-1)     |
| F             | 14 (EF of E + 1)| 3        | 16 (14+3-1)    |

    *For Activity C, predecessors are B (EF=5) and D (EF=7). Take the max EF (7) + 1 = 8.*

**3. Backward Scheduling (Calculate LS & LF):**
*   **Purpose:** Determine the latest possible start and finish for each activity without delaying the project.
*   **Formulas:**
    *   `LS = (LF of activity) - (activity duration) + 1`
    *   `LF = (LS of successor activity) - 1`
*   **Rule for Multiple Successors:** If an activity has multiple successors, its LF is calculated using the **earliest** LS of all its immediate successors.
*   **Starting Point:** For the last activity(ies) with no successors, LF is equal to its EF (the overall project finish date).

| Activity Name | LS             | Duration | LF             |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| F             | 14 (16-3+1)    | 3        | 16 (Project End)|
| E             | 8 (13-6+1)     | 6        | 13 (LS of F - 1)|
| D             | 4 (7-4+1)      | 4        | 7 (LS of E - 1)*|
| C             | 12 (13-2+1)    | 2        | 13 (LS of F - 1)|
| B             | 10 (11-2+1)    | 2        | 11 (LS of C - 1)|
| A             | 1 (4-3+1)      | 3        | 3 (LS of D - 1)|

    *For Activity D, successors are C (LS=12) and E (LS=8). Take the min LS (8) - 1 = 7.*

**4. Calculate Total Float & Identify Critical Path:**
*   **Calculate Total Float (TF)** for each activity using `TF = LF - EF` or `TF = LS - ES`.
*   **Identify Critical Path:** The critical path consists of activities where TF = 0.

| Activity Name | ES | EF | LS | LF | TF (LF-EF) |
| :------------ | :- | :- | :- | :- | :--------- |
| A             | 1  | 3  | 1  | 3  | 0          |
| B             | 4  | 5  | 10 | 11 | 6          |
| C             | 8  | 9  | 12 | 13 | 4          |
| D             | 4  | 7  | 4  | 7  | 0          |
| E             | 8  | 13 | 8  | 13 | 0          |
| F             | 14 | 16 | 14 | 16 | 0          |

*   **Result:** Activities A, D, E, F have a Total Float of 0.
*   **Critical Path:** **A - D - E - F**
*   **Importance:** Any delay to activities on the critical path will delay the entire project. These activities require intense schedule management.

### 3. Schedule Development Technique: Critical Chain Method (CCM)

CCM is a scheduling method that builds upon CPM by specifically accounting for **limited resources** and **uncertainty** in activity durations.

*   **Enhancement over CPM:** CCM adds **buffers** to the schedule to mitigate the effects of resource allocation, optimization, leveling, and duration uncertainty.
*   **Focus:** Instead of managing total float of network paths, CCM focuses on managing the remaining durations of these buffers against the remaining durations of activity chains.

#### Types of Buffers in CCM:

1.  **Project Buffer:**
    *   Placed at the **very end** of the critical chain.
    *   Purpose: To prevent the target project finish date from slipping due to delays on the critical chain.
2.  **Feeding Buffer:**
    *   Placed at each point where a **non-critical activity path (feeding chain)** merges into the critical chain.
    *   Purpose: To protect the critical chain from delays occurring in these feeding paths.
    *   Size is determined by considering the duration uncertainty of the feeding chain.

# Project Management & Cost Control Learning Guide

## I. Project Scheduling Techniques

### A. Backward Scheduling (Calculating Late Dates)
*   **Purpose:** Determine the latest possible start (LS) and finish (LF) dates for activities without delaying the project.
*   **Late Finish (LF) Calculation:**
    *   For the last activity in a path, its LF is the project's target finish date.
    *   For an activity with successors: Its LF is the *earliest* Late Start (LS) of all its direct successor activities, minus one unit of time.
    *   *Example (Activity D):* If Activity C can start latest on day 12 (LS=12) and Activity E can start latest on day 8 (LS=8), then Activity D must finish by day 7 (LF = min(12, 8) - 1 = 7).
*   **Late Start (LS) Calculation:** LS = LF - Duration + 1

### B. Critical Path Method (CPM)
*   **Total Float (TF):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date.
    *   **Formula:** TF = LF - EF (Late Finish - Early Finish) OR TF = LS - ES (Late Start - Early Start)
*   **Critical Path:**
    *   A sequence of activities where the Total Float for *all* activities along that path is **zero**.
    *   Any delay in an activity on the critical path will directly delay the entire project.
    *   **Importance:** Critical path activities are the primary focus for schedule management to ensure the project finishes on time.

### C. Critical Chain Method (CCM)
*   **Purpose:** A scheduling method that extends CPM by accounting for limited resources and activity duration uncertainty.
*   **Key Concept: Buffering**
    *   **Project Buffer:** A time buffer added at the very end of the critical chain to protect the overall project finish date from delays.
    *   **Feeding Buffer:** Time buffers placed where non-critical paths (feeding chains) merge into the critical chain. These protect the critical chain from delays in the feeding paths.
*   **Management Focus:** Instead of tracking Total Float, CCM focuses on managing the remaining durations of buffers against the remaining durations of activity chains.

## II. Schedule Compression Techniques

*   **Goal:** Shorten the project schedule, often due to requirement changes or fixed deadlines.

### A. Crashing
*   **Definition:** Shortening the schedule by adding extra resources to activities.
*   **Application:** Primarily effective for activities on the critical path where adding resources can reduce duration.
*   **Examples:** Approving overtime, hiring more staff, paying for faster completion.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Pros:** Can effectively shorten the schedule.
    *   **Cons:** Almost always increases project costs; can increase risk due to new resources or complex communication.

### B. Fast Tracking
*   **Definition:** Performing activities in parallel (simultaneously) that would normally be done sequentially.
*   **Application:** Only possible when activities can be overlapped.
*   **Example:** Starting construction (foundations) before all detailed architectural drawings are fully complete.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Pros:** Can shorten the schedule without necessarily increasing direct costs (though rework costs might arise).
    *   **Cons:** Significantly increases the risk of rework or errors, as decisions for later activities are made before earlier ones are fully finalized.

## III. Project Cost Management

### A. Overview
*   **Definition:** The processes of planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs to complete a project within an approved financial budget.
*   **Importance:** Projects operate with limited resources, making efficient cost management crucial.

### B. Core Processes
1.  **Cost Management Planning:** Defining how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled.
2.  **Cost Estimation:** Developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete project activities.
3.  **Budgeting:** Aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline.
4.  **Cost Control:** Monitoring project status to update project costs and managing changes to the cost baseline.

### C. Cost Estimation Techniques
*   **One-Point Estimating:** A single, most likely estimate.
*   **Three-Point Estimating:** Uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to calculate a range or weighted average.
*   **Analogous Estimating:** Uses actual costs from previous, similar projects as a basis.
*   **Parametric Estimating:** Uses statistical relationships between historical data and other variables (e.g., cost per line of code, cost per square foot).

## Project Cost Management: A Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to Cost Management

**What is Cost Management?**
Cost management is the process of planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs to complete a project within its approved budget. It's crucial because projects operate with limited resources.

**Why is Cost Management Important?**
*   Projects require formal approval and allocated budgets.
*   Exceeding the budget due to poor cost management (e.g., scope expansion, schedule delays) requires reporting to stakeholders.
*   Effective cost management means:
    *   Accurate cost estimation at the start.
    *   Good scope and schedule management throughout the project.

**Cost vs. Price:**
*   **Cost:** The monetary value of resources invested in producing a product or service. Determined by the supplier's production capacity.
*   **Price:** The amount a client pays for a product or service. Determined by business judgment between client and supplier.
*   *Note:* "Cost" is often used for profit/loss measurement of individual products/services, while "expense" is period-based.

### 2. The Cost Management Process

Project cost management involves a set of activities to ensure the project stays within budget. The main process steps are:

1.  **Cost Management Planning**
2.  **Cost Estimation**
3.  **Budgeting**
4.  **Cost Control**

#### A. Cost Management Planning

This is the initial step to define *how* project costs will be managed throughout its lifecycle. It involves:
*   Establishing methods for cost management.
*   Determining various cost estimation techniques to use.
*   Identifying responsibilities for cost management roles.
*   Setting up how costs will be predicted based on project information.

#### B. Cost Estimation

This process develops an estimate of the monetary resources needed to complete the project.

**Key Estimation Techniques:**

*   **Analogous Estimating:**
    *   Estimates current project cost based on similar past projects (scope, cost, budget, duration).
*   **Bottom-up Estimating:**
    *   Estimates the cost of individual, lowest-level work packages and then sums them up to get an overall project cost.
    *   **Pros:** High accuracy, detailed.
    *   **Cons:** Time-consuming, affected by individual activity complexity.
*   **Expert Judgment:**
    *   Uses expertise from individuals or groups to provide cost estimates, considering factors like labor, materials, inflation, and risks from similar past projects.
*   **Three-point Estimating:**
    *   Uses three values to estimate cost, accounting for uncertainty and risk:
        *   **Most Likely:** Realistic estimate.
        *   **Optimistic:** Best-case scenario.
        *   **Pessimistic:** Worst-case scenario.
    *   *(Often calculated as (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6 for a weighted average, though not explicitly stated in the text).*

**Software-Specific Cost Estimation Techniques:**

*   **Function Point (FP):**
    *   An international standard (ISO/IEC 14143) for estimating software development cost.
    *   Measures software scale quantitatively from the user's perspective (functions requested/delivered).
    *   Multiplies the calculated Function Points by a unit price per FP to get the cost.
    *   **Advantage:** Can estimate project size *before* development starts by identifying user functions, unlike methods based on Lines of Code (LOC) or Man/Month (M/M).
    *   **Function Categories:**
        *   **Data Functions:** Internal Logical Files, External Interface Files.
        *   **Transaction Functions:** External Inputs, External Outputs, External Inquiries.
*   **Man/Month (M/M):** (Mentioned in keywords and FP comparison, implies it's another method, though not detailed here).
*   **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model):** (Mentioned in keywords and FP comparison, implies it's another method, though not detailed here, often LOC-based).

#### C. Budgeting

This process aggregates all estimated costs (from individual activities and work packages) to create an **approved cost baseline**.
*   **Cost Baseline:** The approved version of the project budget, *excluding* management reserves.
*   **Project Budget:** The sum of the Cost Baseline and Management Reserves.
*   **Contingency Reserves:** Funds included in the *cost baseline* to cover unexpected costs for *planned activities* (managed by the project manager).
*   **Management Reserves:** Funds held for *unforeseen changes to scope or work not yet defined* (controlled by senior management like CTO, sponsor, or CEO).

#### D. Cost Control

This process monitors the status of project costs and manages changes to the cost baseline.
*   **Goal:** To identify variances (differences between planned and actual costs) and take corrective action.

**Earned Value Management (EVM):**
*   A widely used method for cost control.
*   It integrates scope, schedule, and cost performance.
*   Compares the value of work *earned* (completed) against the value of work *planned* and the *actual cost* incurred.

**Key EVM Terms (from keywords):**
*   **BAC (Budget At Completion):** The total budget planned for the project.
*   **Planned Value (PV):** The budgeted cost of work scheduled to be completed by a given date.
*   **Earned Value (EV):** The budgeted cost of work actually performed by a given date.
*   **Actual Cost (AC):** The total cost actually incurred for the work performed by a given date.

**EVM Analysis Metrics (from keywords):**
*   **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV (measures schedule performance).
*   **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC (measures cost performance).
*   **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV (efficiency of schedule progress).
*   **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC (efficiency of budget utilization).

**EVM Estimation Metrics (from keywords):**
*   **EAC (Estimate At Completion):** The projected total cost of the project when completed.
*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):** The estimated cost needed to finish the remaining work.

**Example of Cost Control (Simplified):**
If an activity was planned for 5 days at KRW 300,000/day, totaling KRW 1,500,000.
*   **Planned (PV):** KRW 1,500,000 for the full activity.
*   **Actual Progress:** After 5 days, only 90% of the work is complete.
*   **Earned Value (EV):** 90% of KRW 1,500,000 = KRW 1,350,000.
*   **Analysis:** If the actual cost (AC) for this 90% completion was, say, KRW 1,500,000 (meaning you spent the full budget but only got 90% done), then:
    *   **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC = KRW 1,350,000 - KRW 1,500,000 = -KRW 150,000 (cost overrun).
    *   This shows that KRW 150,000 was spent excessively for the work completed, or less work was achieved for the money spent.

## Project Management & Technical Communication: Cost Management & Estimation

This guide covers essential concepts in project cost management, including estimation methods, budgeting, control, and specific estimation techniques.

### 1. Cost Estimation Methods

These are general techniques for estimating project costs:

*   **Analogous Estimating:**
    *   Estimates current project cost based on scope, cost, budget, and duration of similar past projects.
*   **Bottom-up Estimating:**
    *   Estimates by summing costs of the smallest work packages to get the total project cost.
    *   **Pros:** More accurate.
    *   **Cons:** Time-consuming, affected by individual activity complexity.
*   **Expert Judgment:**
    *   Uses experts' knowledge of labor, materials, inflation, and risks from similar projects and the current environment.
*   **Three-point Estimating:**
    *   Estimates project cost using three values: most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic.
    *   Accounts for uncertainty and risk in cost estimation.

### 2. Budgeting

Budgeting is the process of creating an approved **cost baseline** by aggregating individual cost estimations. It ensures all costs are managed in an integrated way.

*   **Cost Baseline:**
    *   The approved version of the project budget.
    *   **Excludes:** Management reserves.
    *   **Includes:** Contingency reserves (for unplanned activities or known risks).
*   **Project Budget:**
    *   The total sum of the **cost baseline** and **management reserves**.
*   **Contingency Reserves:**
    *   Funds set aside for *known-unknowns* (e.g., risks identified but not fully understood). Included in the cost baseline.
*   **Management Reserves:**
    *   Funds set aside for *unknown-unknowns* (unforeseen scope changes or major risks). Not included in the cost baseline; typically controlled by senior management (CTO, CEO).

### 3. Cost Control

Cost control monitors project cost status and manages changes to the cost baseline.

*   **Earned Value Management (EVM):**
    *   A method used for cost control and performance measurement.
    *   Compares the actual cost and progress of work to the planned budget.
    *   **Example Illustration:** If an activity planned for 5 days at KRW 300,000/day (total KRW 1,500,000) is only 90% complete by the due date, the "earned value" is KRW 1,350,000 (5 days * 0.9 * KRW 300,000). The difference (KRW 1,500,000 - KRW 1,350,000 = KRW 150,000) indicates the work that hasn't been completed as scheduled, implying an excessive cost spent for the actual work done.

### 4. Cost Estimation Techniques (Specific Methods)

Common techniques for estimating software development costs include Function Point (FP), Man/Month (M/M), and COCOMO.

#### A) Function Point (FP)

*   **What it is:** An international standard (ISO/IEC 14143) for estimating software development cost by measuring its functional size from a user's perspective. It quantifies functions requested by and delivered to users.
*   **Use Cases:** Software development, maintenance, and operation.
*   **Advantages:** Can estimate project size early by identifying user requirements, unlike LOC-based (Lines Of Code) methods.
*   **Function Types:**
    *   **Data Functions:**
        *   Internal Logical Files (ILF)
        *   External Interface Files (EIF)
    *   **Transaction Functions:**
        *   External Inputs (EI)
        *   External Outputs (EO)
        *   External Inquiries (EQ)

**Function Point Calculation Process:**

1.  **Determine Type of Count:** Choose Development, Enhancement, or Application FP count.
2.  **Identify Scope & Boundary:** Define full software scope and application boundaries.
3.  **Measure Data Functions:**
    *   Identify ILF and EIF.
    *   Determine complexity (based on Data Element Types (DET) - number of attributes, and Record Element Types (RET) - number of subgroups).
    *   Derive data function points.
4.  **Measure Transaction Functions:**
    *   Identify EI, EO, EQ for each activity unit.
    *   Determine complexity (based on DET and File Transfer Reference Types (FTR)).
    *   Derive transaction function points.
5.  **Determine Unadjusted Function Points (UFP):**
    *   UFP = Sum of Data Function Points + Transaction Function Points.
6.  **Determine Value Adjustment Factor (VAF):**
    *   **General System Characteristics (GSCs):** Evaluate 14 characteristics (e.g., Data communications, Performance, Reusability) on a scale of 0-5.
    *   **Total Degree of Influence (TDI):** Sum of weighted GSC values.
    *   **VAF Formula:** `VAF = (TDI * 0.01) + 0.65`
7.  **Determine Adjusted Function Points (AFP):**
    *   `Adjusted FP Count = Unadjusted FP Count × VAF`

**Function Point Analysis (FPA) Methods:**

*   **Estimated FPA:** Uses weighted average complexity ratings (High/Avg/Low); applied in planning and acquisition stages.
*   **Detailed FPA:** Determines specific complexity; applied after the design stage.
*   **Current Practice:** FPA is widely used, especially in public projects, for cost estimation based on functional requirements.

#### B) Man/Month (MM)

*   **What it is:** A method to estimate project cost based on the total labor consumed, drawing from previous similar projects.
*   **Project Development Cost Formula:**
    `Total Cost = Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost + Royalty + Direct Cost`

1.  **Direct Labor Cost:**
    *   Determined by allocating required labor for each work package (from WBS).
    *   Calculated using unit price per labor (e.g., average wages for software engineers published by industry associations, often varying by engineer classification like Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Principal).
2.  **Overhead Cost:**
    *   Indirect expenses for administrative operations (planning, management, general affairs).
    *   Typically calculated as 110-120% of direct labor cost.
3.  **Royalty:**
    *   Payment for using and accumulating developed technology.
    *   Typically calculated as 20-40% of (Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost).
4.  **Direct Cost:**
    *   Expenses directly for software development (e.g., royalties for software tools, professional fees, travel, materials).
*   **Current Practice:** Man/Month is commonly used in private projects and for cross-verification with FPA (especially in public projects where FPA is often mandatory).

#### C) COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

*   **What it is:** A software cost estimation model that uses a regression formula with parameters like development period, man-months, and maintenance costs applied to system modules and subsystems.
*   **Types by Calculation Complexity:**
    *   **Basic:** Simpler calculation.
    *   **Intermediate:** More detailed, considers cost drivers.
    *   **Detailed:** Most complex, applies cost drivers to individual modules.
*   **Types by Project Type:**
    *   **Organic Mode:** Small, simple projects with experienced teams.
    *   **Semi-Detached Mode:** Medium-sized projects, mixed experience teams.
    *   **Embedded Mode:** Complex, large-scale projects with strict constraints.
    *   Each mode considers effort, development time, average staff size, and productivity differently.

**Basic COCOMO Model Calculation (Effort):**

*   **Effort (E):** `E = a * (KLOC)^b`
    *   `a` and `b` are coefficients that vary based on the project type (Organic, Semi-Detached, Embedded).
    *   **KLOC (Kilo Line Of Code):** The estimated number of delivered lines of code, in thousands.

*   **Earned Value (EV) / Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP):** The value of the work *actually* completed at a given point in time.

#### B. Key Terms of EVM

| Term | Explanation                                                                                                 | Formula / Interpretation                                   |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PV** | **Planned Value:** The approved (planned) budget for work scheduled to be completed by a given date.        |                                                            |
| **EV** | **Earned Value:** The budgeted cost of the work actually performed.                                         |                                                            |
| **AC** | **Actual Cost:** The costs actually incurred for the work completed to date.                                |                                                            |
| **SV** | **Schedule Variance:** Measures actual progress against expected progress.                                  | **SV = EV - PV** <br/> > 0: Ahead of schedule <br/> < 0: Behind schedule |

#### C. EVM Graph Interpretation

*   A typical EVM graph plots Cumulative Cost (AC, PV, EV) against the Project Schedule.
*   **SV** is the vertical distance between EV and PV.
*   **CV** is the vertical distance between EV and AC.

*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):** The estimated cost of the remaining work.

#### E. Methods to Calculate ETC

1.  **Using CPI:**
    *   Assumes future work will be completed at the same cost performance as past work.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = (Budget at Completion (BAC) - Earned Value (EV)) / Cost Performance Index (CPI)
2.  **Applying Original Budget without Change:**
    *   Assumes remaining work will be completed as originally budgeted.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = (Budget at Completion (BAC) - Earned Value (EV))
3.  **New Estimate:**
    *   Used when past performance is irrelevant, and a new, detailed estimate for the remaining work is created.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = New estimate for the remaining work

# Project Management: Earned Value & Quality Management

## Section 1: Earned Value Management (EVM)

**What is Earned Value Management (EVM)?**
EVM is a project performance technique that integrates schedule and cost to analyze performance and predict the project's final cost and schedule.

**Key EVM Terms & Formulas:**

*   **PV (Planned Value) / BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled):**
    *   The approved budget for the work *planned* to be performed by a certain date.
    *   *Example:* For a 5-day activity, PV = 5 days' budget.

*   **AC (Actual Cost) / ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed):**
    *   The costs *actually incurred* for the work completed to date.
    *   *Example:* If a 5-day activity took 6 days/persons, AC = 6 days' budget.

*   **EV (Earned Value) / BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed):**
    *   The *budgeted cost* of the work that has *actually been performed* (the value of work done).
    *   *Example:* If 80% of a 5-day activity is done, EV = 5 days * 0.8 = 4 days' budget.

---

### Schedule Performance Indicators:

*   **SV (Schedule Variance): EV - PV**
    *   Measures actual progress against expected progress.
    *   **SV > 0:** Ahead of schedule.
    *   **SV < 0:** Behind schedule.
    *   *Example:* EV=4, PV=5. SV = 4 - 5 = -1 (1 day behind schedule).

*   **SPI (Schedule Performance Index): EV / PV**
    *   Measures the efficiency of schedule performance.
    *   **SPI > 1:** On or ahead of schedule.
    *   **SPI < 1:** Behind schedule.

---

### Cost Performance Indicators:

*   **CV (Cost Variance): EV - AC**
    *   Measures actual cost against budgeted cost for work performed.
    *   **CV > 0:** Under budget.
    *   **CV < 0:** Over budget.
    *   *Example:* EV=4, AC=6. CV = 4 - 6 = -2 (2 units over budget).

*   **CPI (Cost Performance Index): EV / AC**
    *   Measures the efficiency of cost utilization.
    *   **CPI > 1:** On or under budget.
    *   **CPI < 1:** Over budget.

---

**Interpreting EVM Data (Example):**
If SV is negative and CV is negative, it means the project is both behind schedule and over budget.

**Forecasting Project Performance:**

*   **EAC (Estimate At Completion):**
    *   The estimated *total cost* of the project at completion.
    *   **Formula:** `EAC = AC (Actual Cost) + ETC (Estimate To Complete)`

*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):**
    *   The estimated cost of the *remaining work* to finish the project.
    *   **Methods to calculate ETC:**
        1.  **Considering CPI:** `ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI` (BAC = Budget At Completion)
            *   Assumes future work will be performed at the current cost efficiency.
        2.  **Using Original Budget:** `ETC = (BAC - EV)`
            *   Assumes future work will be performed at the original budgeted rate.
        3.  **New Estimate:** `ETC = New estimate for the remaining work`
            *   Used when past performance is not a good indicator for future work.

**Methods for Measuring Work in Progress (to calculate EV):**
These methods help assign an Earned Value to ongoing tasks:

*   **Percent Complete:** Assigns EV directly proportional to the physical percentage of work completed.
    *   *Example:* If 40% complete, claim 40% of the task's budget as EV.
*   **50/50 Rule:** 50% EV credit when a task starts, the remaining 50% when it's completed.
*   **20/80 Rule:** 20% EV credit when a task starts, the remaining 80% when it's completed.
*   **0/100 Rule:** 0% EV credit when a task starts, 100% only when it's fully completed.

## Section 2: Quality Management

**Why Quality Management is Important:**
Modern software projects are complex, leading to issues like delivery delays, low customer satisfaction, and high operational costs. Effective quality management addresses these challenges.

**Core Components of Quality Management:**
Quality management generally consists of:
1.  **Quality Planning:** Defining quality standards and how to meet them.
2.  **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring that the processes used to build the product are effective.
3.  **Quality Control:** Monitoring specific project results to verify they meet quality standards.
    *   The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is often used here.

**Key Terms & Standards:**

*   **Quality Standards:** ISO/IEC 9126 (Software Quality), ISO/IEC 12207 (Software Lifecycle), CMMI, Six Sigma, ISO 9000.
*   **Quality Evaluation Perspectives:** Product quality, Process quality, Project quality.

**Quality Control: Manufacturing vs. Project (IT Specifics):**

*   **Manufacturing Quality Control:** Focuses on *product quality*, managing defects across many identical products.
*   **Project Quality Control (especially IT Projects):**
    *   Focuses on *process quality* because outputs (like a system) are unique, few, and often intangible.
    *   The goal is to manage errors within the development process to produce a high-quality, error-free output.
    *   **For IT projects, quality control is crucial for *intermediate outputs* at each project stage** (e.g., analysis, design, execution, testing, deployment).

**Quality Management Activities & Support:**

*   Activities are carried out through techniques like:
    *   **Reviews:** Formal meetings to evaluate documents or products.
    *   **Inspections:** Structured process to find defects.
    *   **Walk-throughs:** Meeting where a work product is presented to peers for comments.
*   Guidance often comes from specialized quality management or quality assurance teams.
*   For enterprise-wide quality control, the **PMO (Project Management Office)** helps establish and monitor quality standards across projects.

**Benefits of Effective Quality Management:**

*   **Minimize Quality Cost:** By meeting customer requirements (e.g., of the acquirer) from the start.
*   **Reduce Rework:** Through clear requirements validation and verification.
*   **Improve Scope Management:** Prevents missing requirements.
*   **Improve Schedule Management:** Reduces wasted time caused by errors and rework.

#### **A. Concept of Quality Control**

*   **Definition:** Activities and procedures that record and monitor quality activity results to achieve quality targets.
*   **Purpose:** Verify project results meet quality standards, measure variances (performance, schedule, cost), analyze nonconformity, and suggest corrective actions.

#### **B. Quality Control Tools and Techniques (The 7 Basic Quality Tools)**

These tools use statistical information to identify and solve quality problems, often within the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycle.

1.  **Pareto Chart:**
    *   **Purpose:** Prioritize problems by sorting defects/causes by frequency of occurrence.
    *   **Principle:** Relatively few causes (the "vital few") generally lead to most problems (the 80/20 rule).
    *   **Visual:** Histogram showing frequency, with a cumulative percentage line.
2.  **Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone Diagram / Ishikawa Diagram):**
    *   **Purpose:** Represent how causes and effects relate. Identifies possible causes for a specific effect (problem).
    *   **Use:** Commonly used for preventing defects in product design and quality.
    *   **Structure:** Looks like a fishbone, with the "effect" at the head and main "causes" branching off.
3.  **Control Chart:**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine if a process maintains a certain level of quality (is "in control").
    *   **Indicator:** A process is judged unstable if the number of defects exceeds control limits (upper/lower control limits, target value).
4.  **Scatter Diagram:**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify the impact and relationship between two variables.
    *   **Use:** Visually expresses the cause (factor) and effect (characteristic) relationship between variables.
5.  **Other Basic Tools:** Flowchart, Check Sheet, Histogram (mentioned but not detailed in text).

## Project Risk Management Learning Guide

This guide covers the core concepts and processes of project risk management.

### Key Definitions

*   **Contingency:** A financial or time reserve calculated to address potential risks. It can be based on:
    *   The expected value of a risk's probability and impact.
    *   A percentage of the total project budget.
*   **Countermeasure:** A specific action or plan established and executed on an ad-hoc basis to respond to a identified risk.

### The Risk Management Process

Risk management involves four main stages:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Recognizing and documenting potential risks.
2.  **Risk Analysis/Evaluation:** Assessing the probability and impact of identified risks.
3.  **Risk Response:** Developing and planning actions to address risks.
4.  **Risk Control:** Monitoring risks, implementing responses, and evaluating effectiveness.

---

### 1. Risk Identification

**Goal:** To find and document all potential risks that could affect the project as early as possible.

**Key Point:** Prioritize reviewing contractual obligations, proposals, and project execution plans. Any omission in the plan that is specified in the contract can lead to acceptance criteria violations.

**Methods for Risk Identification:**

*   **Documentation Reviews:** Examine project plans, assumptions, previous project files, contracts, and other project documents.
*   **Information Gathering Techniques:**
    *   **Brainstorming:** Group idea generation.
    *   **Delphi Technique:** Expert opinions gathered anonymously to reach a consensus.
    *   **Interviews:** Discussions with project stakeholders and experts.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the underlying reasons for potential problems.
*   **Checklist Analysis:** Using pre-existing lists from similar projects or knowledge bases. A Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) can serve as a checklist.
*   **Assumption Analysis:** Reviewing project assumptions to identify inaccuracies, instability, inconsistencies, or incompleteness.
*   **Diagramming Techniques:** Visual tools to identify relationships and potential risks:
    *   **Cause and Effect Diagrams (Fishbone):** Identify potential causes for a specific effect.
    *   **System or Process Flow Diagrams:** Illustrate how system elements interact.
    *   **Interrelationship Diagrams:** Show relationships between various factors.
*   **SWOT Analysis:** Investigating project Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to broaden the scope of identified risks (including internal risks).
*   **Expert Judgment:** Direct identification of risks by experts with relevant project or business experience.

**Output: The Risk Register**

*   A document used to record, track, and manage identified risks.
*   It typically includes:
    *   **ID:** Unique identifier for the risk.
    *   **Risk Item:** Description of the risk.
    *   **Probability:** Likelihood of occurrence.
    *   **Impact:** Severity of the effect.
    *   **Exposure:** Calculated risk level (e.g., Probability x Impact).
    *   **Priority:** Rank of the risk.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Planned response action.
    *   **Manager:** Person responsible for the risk.
*   The Risk Register is updated throughout the project with analysis results and control information.

---

### 2. Risk Analysis

This stage assesses identified risks to prioritize them for response planning.

#### A) Qualitative Risk Analysis

**Goal:** To prioritize risks by qualitatively evaluating their probability of occurrence and potential impact on project objectives.

**Technique: Probability-Impact Matrix**

*   A matrix that plots risks based on their qualitative probability and impact ratings.
*   **Risk Level Calculation:** Risk Level = Probability of Occurrence (P) × Degree of Impact (I).
*   **Rating Scales (Examples):**
    *   **Probability:** Very Low (0.1) to Very High (0.9).
    *   **Impact:** Very Low (0.1) to Very High (0.8) on project objectives.
*   Risks are then ranked (e.g., Low, Moderate, High) to help prioritize response planning.

#### B) Quantitative Risk Analysis

**Goal:** To numerically estimate the overall effect of prioritized risks on project objectives (e.g., cost, schedule). This typically follows qualitative analysis.

**Methods for Quantitative Risk Analysis:**

*   **Interviews:** Experts quantify probability and impact based on experience and precedents.
*   **Probability Distributions:** Used in modeling to measure the uncertainty of values like activity durations or cost components.
*   **Tornado Diagrams:** Show how sensitive project outcomes are to changes in individual risk factors. Results are displayed as a bar graph, ordered by sensitivity.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Describes hypothetical future situations based on assumptions, then analyzes the impact of each assumption on project results.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
    *   Repeatedly substitutes a range of random values for parameters in a probability model.
    *   Generates a cumulative distribution of possible outcomes to predict a specific variable.
    *   Provides a probabilistic model by analyzing these cumulative results.
*   **Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis:**
    *   Calculates the expected financial outcome by considering risks.
    *   Requires a "risk-neutral" assumption (neither avoiding nor seeking risk).
    *   Multiplies each possible outcome by its probability and sums these values.
    *   Often used in conjunction with decision tree analysis.

---

### 3. Risk Response

**Goal:** To develop and implement actions that reduce negative threats and enhance positive opportunities for project objectives.

**Strategies for Negative Risks (Threats):** These aim to minimize negative impacts.

*   **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk completely by changing the project plan, scope, or strategy. Examples: extending schedule, altering strategy, reducing scope.
*   **Transfer:** Shift the impact and responsibility of the risk to a third party. This doesn't eliminate the risk, but shifts who handles it. Effective for financial risks. Tools include insurance, performance bonds, warranties, and guarantees.
*   **Mitigate:** Reduce the probability of the risk occurring or its impact to an acceptable level. Examples: early preventive measures, extensive testing, selecting simpler processes.
*   **Acceptance:** Adopted when eliminating the risk isn't possible.
    *   **Passive Acceptance:** No active steps are taken other than documenting the risk. The project team deals with the risk if it occurs.
    *   **Active Acceptance:** Proactively building contingency reserves (time, capital, resources) to deal with the risk if it occurs.

**Strategies for Positive Risks (Opportunities):** These aim to maximize positive impacts.

*   **Exploit:** Take actions to ensure the opportunity happens and its benefits are realized. Examples: dedicating skilled resources, reducing costs to make an opportunity more viable.
*   **Share:** Partner with other organizations or teams to realize an opportunity, sharing the benefits and risks. Examples: forming partnerships.
*   **Enhance:** Increase the probability or impact of an opportunity. Identifies main causes and takes actions to maximize effectiveness.
*   **Acceptance:** Choose to take advantage of an opportunity if it arises, but without actively pursuing it.

---

### 4. Risk Control

**Goal:** To implement the risk response plan, track identified risks, monitor new and residual risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management activities.

**Methods for Risk Control:**

*   **Risk Reassessment:** Regularly perform activities to:
    *   Identify new risks that emerge.
    *   Reassess the status and impact of current risks.
    *   Terminate risks that are no longer relevant or have passed.
*   **Risk Audits:** Investigate and document:
    *   The effectiveness of chosen risk countermeasures.
    *   The effectiveness of the overall risk management process.
*   **Variance and Trend Analysis:**
    *   Compare planned project outputs with actual outputs.
    *   Review trends in project execution using performance information to identify potential issues or successes.
*   **Technical Performance Measurement:**
    *   Compare the project's technical performance against the technical performance schedule in the project plan.
    *   Measures can include weight, number of transactions, defective deliveries, storage capacity, etc.

---

### Recent Trends in Project Evaluation

*   **Past Criteria:** Project success was measured by completion on schedule, within budget, and meeting original objectives.
*   **Current Criteria:** Project success is now increasingly measured by its quantitative and qualitative contribution to:
    *   Achieving the company's management goals.
    *   Improving the company's competitiveness.

### Project Evaluation Overview

#### B. Aspects of Project Evaluation
Projects are typically evaluated from three key perspectives:

1.  **Financial Perspective:** Evaluates investment costs and Return on Investment (ROI).
2.  **Management Perspective:** Assesses the project's progress processes, including:
    *   Schedule management
    *   Scope management
    *   Quality management
    *   Risk management
3.  **Technical Perspective:** Reviews the technologies and solutions applied within the project.

### 4. Project Evaluation Process and PMO

#### A. Project Evaluation
*   **Scope:** Involves evaluating everything from the project's start to the post-completion investment.
*   **Importance:** Crucial for companies managing multiple projects and significant investments, requiring systematic management and fair ex-post evaluation.

#### B. Project Management Office (PMO)
*   **Role:** A Project Management Office (PMO) often facilitates systematic project evaluation.
*   **PMO Activities Related to Evaluation:**
    *   **Integrated Management:** Oversees various project management areas (e.g., scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk).
    *   **Investment Decision-making:** Supports decisions using analyses like SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
    *   **Investment Evaluation Management:** Manages the evaluation process, including initial entry, results analysis, and gap analysis.

#### C. Example Project Evaluation Items
Key criteria used to evaluate a project's success and value:

*   Return on Investment (ROI)
*   Business Strategy Consistency
*   Sales Increase Effect
*   Cost Reduction Effect
*   User Satisfaction
*   Competitive Differentiation
*   Process Improvement
*   Recycle/Reusability

#### D. Performance Measurement
*   **Purpose:** Quantitatively verify if the project achieved its stated goals (e.g., based on business case, project charter).
*   **Method:** Often involves measuring key metrics (e.g., monthly sales for a new system) over time to assess performance and inform future operations and improvements.

### 5. Project Evaluation Stages

Project evaluation is conducted at different points in the project lifecycle:

*   **Ex-ante Evaluation:** Conducted **before** the project begins. Focuses on feasibility, justification, and alignment with business goals.
*   **Interim Evaluation:** Conducted **during** the project's execution. Monitors progress, identifies issues, and allows for corrective actions.
*   **Ex-post Evaluation:** Conducted **after** the project is completed. Assesses final outcomes, ROI, lessons learned, and overall impact.
