## Learning Guide: Ancient Mesoamerican Civilizations (Maya, Inca, Aztec)

---

### I. Maya Civilization

The Maya were known for their advancements in science, technology, and learning.

**A. Astronomy & Timekeeping**
*   **Understanding Celestial Bodies:** Deep knowledge of stars and planets.
*   **Eclipse Prediction:** Able to predict eclipses.
*   **Astrology & Agriculture:** Used astrological cycles for planning planting and harvesting.
*   **Calendar System:** Developed a sophisticated calendar for measuring time.

**B. Technology**
*   **Hydraulics:** Built advanced hydraulic systems.
*   **Crop Growing:** Invented technologies for cultivating crops.
*   **Paints:** Devised glittery paints using mica, a mineral.
*   **Weaving:** Constructed looms for weaving cloth.

**C. Advances in Learning**
*   **Writing System:** Created a complex system of **hieroglyphics** (picture-based writing).
*   **Numerals:** Developed their own set of numerals.
*   **Calendar:** Created a highly accurate **365-day calendar**.

**D. Ancient Innovations**
*   **Rubber:** Perfected the use of rubber 3000 years ago, long before modern patents.

**E. Decline of the Maya**
*   **City Abandonment:** Many major Maya cities were abandoned around 900 A.D.
*   **Unknown Cause:** Archaeologists are unsure why the civilization declined.
*   **Leading Theory:** A severe drought around 900 A.D. may have led to widespread starvation and migration.

### II. Inca Civilization

The Inca were master engineers, innovators, and organizers.

**A. Scientific & Engineering Innovations**
*   **Stonework:**
    *   Constructed stone temples without using mortar.
    *   Stones were cut and fitted so precisely that a knife could not fit between them.
*   **Suspension Bridges:** Credited with inventing the first suspension bridge.
*   **Irrigation Systems:** Developed sophisticated irrigation and water storage techniques to grow crops in various types of land.
*   **Textiles:** Known for their high-quality Inca textiles.

**B. Information Management: Quipu**
*   **Definition:** A system of knotted cords used to store vast amounts of information crucial to their culture and civilization.
*   **Structure:** Typically had a main string (about two feet long) with other strings knotted to it.
*   **Counting System:** Used a base-ten (decimal) system for recording data.
*   **Communication:** Allowed messages and data to be carried across the empire by Inca runners.

**C. Timekeeping: Calendar**
*   **Structure:** Divided into 12 months.
*   **Month Divisions:** Each month was divided into 3 weeks.
*   **Week Length:** Each week had 10 days.
*   **Religious Significance:** Each calendar month hosted a different religious festival.

**D. Medical Advances**
*   **Skull Surgery:** Successfully performed complex skull surgery.
*   **Anesthesia:** Used medicines to make patients unconscious during surgical procedures.

### III. Aztec Civilization

The Aztecs were a dominant power in central Mexico, known for their societal and scientific contributions.

**A. Location**
*   Lived in the **Valley of Mexico** in central Mexico.

**B. Key Scientific Contributions**
*   **Education:** Established mandatory education for their citizens.
*   **Chocolates:** Developed and popularized the use of chocolate.
*   **Antispasmodic Medication:** Created medicines to relieve muscle spasms.
*   **Chinampa:** Developed **chinampas** (floating gardens) for agriculture in lakes.
*   **Aztec Calendar:** Created their own advanced calendar system.
*   **Canoe:** Credited with the invention of the canoe for water travel.
