The Lebombo bone from Africa 1s
oldest known calendar — a baboon
fibia with 29 notches. This has
been dated to 35,000 years ago.

A 29 to 30 day lunar calendar 1s
extremely old and is found all
over the ancient world. Was this
bone a calendar device to help
stone-age Catholics practice the

rhythm method of birth control? @)

Egyptian Civilization
Egypt is geographically situated in the Northeastern part 
of Africa
The presence of the Nile River that cut and flow 
longitudinally from Central Africa and Mediterranean 
provide Egypt the necessary water requirements to 
support agricultural activities.

--- Page 123 ---
One of the oldest mysteries surrounding ancient Egypt concerns the building of the 
PYRAMIDS . How did humans move such massive blocks of stone using only Stone 
Age tools? The Egyptians left thousands of illustrations depicting daily life in the Old 
Kingdom. Curiously enough, none of them show how pyramids were built. 
SEVERAL THEORIES attempt to explain how pyramids were constructed, but for 
now, the mystery has yet to be solved.
