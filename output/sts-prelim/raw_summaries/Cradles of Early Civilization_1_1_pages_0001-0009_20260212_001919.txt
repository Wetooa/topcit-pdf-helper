*   **Limitation:** Cultural factors (religious and philosophical framework) may have prevented Chinese achievements from developing into modern science by hindering the acceptance of "laws of nature."

#### C. Middle East Countries (Golden Age of Islam)

*   **Period:** 7th to 13th century (Muslim scholarship).
*   **Factors for Intellectual Growth:** Common Arabic language, access to Greek texts from the Byzantine Empire, proximity to India.
*   **Scientific Method:** Muslim scientists valued experiments over plain-thought experiments (unlike the Greeks), leading to the development of the scientific method and an empirical approach.

        *   **Contributions:** Discovered the contagious nature of infectious diseases, introduced clinical pharmacology.
*   **Decline:** Began in the 11th-13th century due to Mongol conquests, which destroyed libraries, observatories, and learning institutions.

#### D. Development of Science in Africa

Science emerged in Africa long before European colonization, with early civilizations being knowledge producers.

**1. Ancient Egyptian Civilization**
*   Significant advances in astronomy, mathematics, and medicine.
*   **Geometry:** Developed out of necessity to preserve farmlands along the Nile River. Used to build rectilinear structures and post-and-lintel architecture (e.g., pyramids, early dams).
*   **Alchemy:** Egypt was a center of alchemy, the medieval forerunner of chemistry.
*   **Medicine:** Studied human anatomy and pharmacology; applied examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis (parallels the empirical scientific method).
*   **Astronomy:** Used three types of calendars: lunar, solar, and stellar (or combinations).

**2. Metallurgy**
*   North Africa and the Nile Valley imported iron technology from the Near East, benefiting from developments during the Bronze and Iron Ages.
*   Invented metal tools for homes, agriculture, and architecture.

**3. Mathematics**
*   **Lebombo Bone:** Dated 35,000 BCE, considered the oldest known mathematical artifact. May have been a tool for multiplication, division, simple calculations, or a six-month lunar calendar.
*   **Ancient Egyptians:** Proficient in four fundamental mathematical operations, algebra, and geometry.

### III. Overall Impact of Science on Ancient Civilizations

*   Science developed globally: Asia, Europe, Mesoamerica, Africa.
*   Ancient peoples invented tools for daily life, discovered medicines, observed heavenly bodies, built structures, and developed mathematics.
*   Science provided the means for civilizations to survive, understand the natural and physical world, and develop technologies for everyday tasks.

- .THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS 2

1. . By looking for other sources and literatures, what are the
controversies or questions on Freud’s ideas?

How can you describe Freudian ideas as a scientist?

If Freud is still alive, what do you think are the major changes
he would make to his theory?

Cradles of Early Science

Development of Science in Mesoamerica

Mesoamerica includes the entire area of Central America from
Southern Mexico up to the border of South America. There is no doubt
that the Mesoamerican region is rich in culture and knowledge prior to the
arrival of its European colonizers.

The Maya civilization is one of the famous civilizations that lasted
for approximately 2,000 years. These people are known for their works in
astronc)my. They incorporated their advanced understanding of astronomy
into their temples and other religious structures. This allows them to use
their temples for astronomical observation. For example, the pyramid at
Chichén Itz4 in Mexico is situated at the location of the Sun during the
spring and fall equinoxes. ‘

Mayan knowledge and understanding about celestial bodies was
advanced for their time, as evidenced by their knowledge of predicting
eclipse and using astrological cycles in planting and harvesting. The Mayans
are also known for measuring time using two complicated calendar systems.
These calendars were very useful for their life especially in planning their
activities and in observing their religious rituals and cultural celebrations.

The Mayans also developed the technology for growing different
crops and building elaborate cities using ordinary machineries and tools.
They built hydraulics system with sophisticated waterways to supply water
to different communities. |

Furthermore, they used various tools and adapt themselves to
innovations especially in the field of arts. The Mayans built looms for
weaving cloth and devised a rainbow of glittery paints made from a mineral
called mica. They are also believed to be one of the first people to produce
rubber products 3,000 years before Goodyear received its patent in 1844.

The Mayans are considered one of the most scientifically advanced
societies in Mesoamerica. They are also.famous as one of the world’s first
civilizations to use a writing system known as the Mayan hieroglyphics.
‘They were also skilled in mathematics and created a number system based
on the numeral 20. Moreover, they independently developed the concept
of zero and positional value, even before the Romans did.

The Inca civilization is also famous in Mesoamerica. The Incas made
advanced scientific ideas considering their limitations as an old civilization.
The following were scientific ideas and tools that they developed to help

‘them in everyday life:
1. roads paved with stones;

2. stone buildirigs_ that surmounted earthquakes and other
disasters;

3. irrigation system and technique for storing water for their
crops to grow in all types of land;

4. calendar with 12 months to mark their religious festivals and
prepare them for planting season;

D, ,the' first suspension bridge;

6. quipu, a system of knotted ropes to keep records that only
experts can interpret; and

7. Inca textiles since cloth was one of the specially prized artistic
achievements,

Following the Inca, the Aztec civilization has also made substantial
contributions to science and technology and to the society as a whole.
Some of their contributions are the following:

1. Mandatory education. The Aztec puts value on education; that
is why their children are mandated to get education regardless

of their social class, gender, or age. It is an early form of
universal or inclusive education.

2. Chocolates. The Aztec in Mexico developed chocolate during
their time. In the Mayan culture, they used it as currency. The
Aztec valued the cacao beans highly and made it as part of
their tribute to their gods.

3. Antispasmodic medication. They used a type of antispasmodic
medication that could prevent muscle spasms and relax
muscles, which could help during surgery.

- 4. Chinampa. It is a form of Aztec technology for agricultural
farming in which the land was divided into rectangular areas
and surrounded by canals.

5. Aztec calendar. This enabled them to plan their activities,
rituals, and planting season.

6. Invention of the canoe. A light narrow boat used for traveling in
water systems.
