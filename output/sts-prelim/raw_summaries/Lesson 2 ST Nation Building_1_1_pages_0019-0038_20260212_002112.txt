# Philippines Science and Technology: A Learning Guide

This guide summarizes key government initiatives, research areas, and notable Filipino scientists in the field of Science and Technology.

## I. Government Initiatives & Policy Frameworks

### A. Enhancing S&T Competitiveness
*   The Philippine government implements programs and policies to boost Science and Technology (S&T).
*   The **Department of Science and Technology (DOST)** sought expertise from the **National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP)**.
*   **NRCP's Recommendation:** Policies and programs to improve the Philippines' competitiveness in the ASEAN region.

### B. NRCP Policy Clusters & Key Recommendations

The NRCP clustered its recommendations into four areas:

1.  **Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, International Policies and Governance**
    *   Integrate ASEAN awareness in education.
    *   Emphasize teaching in mother tongue.
    *   Develop infrastructure and ICT broadband.
    *   Ensure local food security.

2.  **Physics, Engineering and Industrial Research, Earth and Space Sciences, and Mathematics**
    *   Emphasize degrees, licenses, and employment opportunities in these fields.
    *   Provide grants for peer monitoring.
    *   Review **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act)**.
    *   Utilize PhilGEPS (Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System).
    *   Harness S&T as a driver of development.

3.  **Medical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Sciences**
    *   Ensure drug manufacturing firms comply with ASEAN-harmonized standards.
    *   Create an educational council for standardization in these fields.
    *   Empower food and drug agencies.
    *   Allocate 2% of the GDP to research.

4.  **Biological Sciences, Agriculture, and Forestry**
    *   Protect and conserve biodiversity through full implementation of existing laws.
    *   Promote the use of biosafety and standard models.
    *   Promote indigenous knowledge systems and indigenous people’s conservation efforts.
    *   Formulate common food and safety standards.

### C. The Human Genome Project (HGP)

*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   Discover all human genes.
    *   Make genes accessible for biological study.
    *   Determine the complete sequence of DNA bases in the human genome.
*   **Specific Goals:**
    *   Identify approximately 20,500 genes in human DNA.
    *   Sequence the 3 billion chemical base pairs of human DNA.
    *   Store this information in databases.
    *   Improve tools for data analysis.

## III. Emerging S&T Research & Project Areas

The Philippines is focusing on research and projects in these critical areas:

1.  **Alternative and Safe Energy**
    *   **Solar energy:** Electricity from the sun.
    *   **Wind energy:** Electrical energy from the wind.
    *   **Biomass electricity:** Plant-derived energy to substitute gasoline.
    *   **Hydroelectric and Ocean energy:** Energies sourced from water.
    *   **Geothermal energy:** Utilization of steam from the ground for heating or electricity.
2.  **Harnessing Mineral Resources**
    *   Focus on potentially valuable minerals with prospects for economic extraction.
    *   *Examples:* Fuel/crude oil, gold, silver, platinum.
3.  **Finding Cures for Various Diseases and Illnesses.**
4.  **Climate Change and Global Warming.**
5.  **Increasing Food Production.**
6.  **Preservation of Natural Resources.**
7.  **Coping with Natural Disasters and Calamities.**
8.  **Infrastructure Development.**

## IV. Factors Influencing S&T Policy Development

The development of S&T policies, programs, and projects in the Philippines is shaped by:
*   **National Goals**
*   **International Treaties**
*   **Legal Frameworks**
*   **Social Needs, Issues, and Problems**

## V. Famous Filipinos in Science

*   **Ramon Cabanos Barba**
    *   **Contribution:** Outstanding research on tissue culture in Philippine mangoes; invented techniques to promote crop flowering using potassium nitrate spray.
    *   **Recognition:** Proclaimed National Scientist of the Philippines in June 2014.
*   **Josefino Cacas Comiso**
    *   **Contribution:** Works on observing the characteristics of Antarctica using satellite images.
*   **Jose Bejar Cruz Jr.**
    *   **Contribution:** Internationally known in electrical engineering; made major contributions to the theory and practice of automatic control.
    *   **Recognition:** Elected officer of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE).
*   **Lourdes Jansuy Cruz**
    *   **Contribution:** Notable for research on sea snail venom; contributed to the development of conotoxins as tools for examining human brain activity.
