    *   **Technology:** Centered on using and developing household tools.
*   **Galleon Trade (1565-1815):**
    *   Contributed to additional technology and development.
    *   Facilitated the exchange of ideas, crops, tools, cultural practices, and Western technologies.
*   **Halt in S&T Growth:** Despite being developed in the region, the growth of science was slowed by:
    *   Superstitious beliefs among the populace.
    *   Dominance of Catholic doctrines and practices.

### III. American Colonial Era

*   **Significant S&T Development:** Americans had a greater impact on S&T advancement in the Philippines.
*   **Key Improvements:**
    *   Established a **public education system**.
    *   Improved engineering works (e.g., infrastructure).
    *   Enhanced public health conditions.
    *   Improved transportation and communication systems.
*   **Medical Research:** Conducted extensive research to control tropical diseases like Malaria, Cholera, and Tuberculosis.

### IV. Post-Colonial Era (World War II & Beyond)

*   **World War II Impact:**
    *   Severely destabilized the country's development.
    *   Limited resources and capacity for rebuilding after widespread destruction.
*   **Post-War Focus:** The newly established republic concentrated on using its limited resources to enhance its scientific and technological capabilities.
*   **Overseas Development Allocations (ODA):** Funding from other countries played a crucial role in improving the Philippines' scientific productivity and technological capability.

---

### V. Influences on S&T Development in the Philippines

*   **Internal Influences:**
    *   **Survival:** Basic needs driving innovation.
    *   **Culture:** Traditional practices and indigenous knowledge.
    *   **Economic Activities:** Agriculture, trade, and industry.
*   **External Influences:**
    *   **Foreign Colonizers:** Spanish and American rule.
    *   **Trades with Foreign Countries:** E.g., Galleon Trade.
    *   **International Economic Demands:** Global market needs and trends.

---

### VI. Government Policies on Science and Technology

*   **Goal:** The Philippine government actively implements programs, projects, and policies to boost the nation's S&T capacity.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   Programs and projects are geared towards advancing S&T.
    *   Recognition and support for Filipino scientists.
*   **DOST and NRCP Collaboration:**
    *   The **Department of Science and Technology (DOST)** seeks expertise from the **National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP)**.
    *   **NRCP Recommendations:** Advised policies and programs aimed at enhancing the Philippines' competitiveness within the ASEAN region.
