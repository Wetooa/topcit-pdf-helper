### II. History and Nature of Science: The Scientific Enterprise

*   Science and technology involve diverse types of work.

### III. Influential International Scientists and Their Discoveries

*   **Sir Isaac Newton** (England: 1643-1727)
    *   **Key Contributions:**
        *   Formulated the **Three Universal Laws of Motion**.
        *   Described the **Gravitational Force**.
    *   **Newton's Laws of Motion:**
        1.  **Law of Inertia:** An object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
        2.  **Law of Acceleration:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma). The acceleration is in the same direction as the net force.
        3.  **Law of Action and Reaction:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

    *   **Key Invention:** The **telephone**.
    *   **Other Contributions:** Founding member of the National Geographic Society; worked on hydrofoils and aeronautics.
*   **Archimedes** (Ancient Syracuse/Greece: 287 BC - 212 BC)

One of the most influential 
scientists in history!England:  1643 -1727
Known for his three Universal Laws of Motion and 
gravitational force.
◦Law of inertia -An object at rest tend to 
stay at rest
◦Law of acceleration –the acceleration of an 
object as produced by a net force is directly 
proportional to the magnitude of the net force 
in the same direction as the net force.
◦Law of action and reaction –For every action 
there is an equal and opposite reaction .

Father of Microbiology Netherlands: 1632 -1723Improved the microscope -first to describe single -celled organisms
Created over 400 microscopes, 9 of which are still used today
. . . my work, which I've done for a long 
time, was not pursued in order to gain the 
praise I now enjoy, but chiefly from a 
craving after knowledge, which I notice 
resides in me more than in most other 
men. And therewithal, whenever I found 
out anything remarkable, I have thought it 
my duty to put down my discovery on 
paper, so that all ingenious people might 
be informed thereof. 
Antony van Leeuwenhoek. 
Letter of June 12, 1716
