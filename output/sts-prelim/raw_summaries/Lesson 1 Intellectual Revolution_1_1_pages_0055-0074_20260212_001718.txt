## Learning Guide: Key Figures and Ancient Civilizations

### I. Charles Darwin (1809-1882)

**A. Key Contributions:**
*   Provided evidence that species evolve over time.
*   Proposed the **Theory of Natural Selection** in 1859 to explain evolution, often summarized as "survival of the fittest."
*   Believed that changes within species lead to new species replacing older, less successful ones, which become extinct.
*   Fossil evidence supports that species evolved from extinct ancestral forms.
    *   **Extinct:** Species that have permanently disappeared.

**B. Key Life Milestones:**
*   **1809:** Born in Shrewsbury, England.
*   **1831:** Graduated from Cambridge University; embarked on a five-year voyage aboard the HMS Beagle, including the Galapagos Islands.
*   **1836:** Returned from his voyage, established himself as a scientist in London.
*   **1838:** Recognized the importance of natural selection after reading Thomas Malthus.
*   **1858:** Joint presentation of Wallace-Darwin papers on natural selection to the Linnean Society.
*   **1859:** Published his seminal work, *On the Origin of Species*.
*   **1871:** Published *The Descent of Man, Selection in Relation to Sex*.
*   **1882:** Died; buried at Westminster Abbey, London.

### II. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)

**A. Introduction:**
*   An Austrian neurologist.
*   Considered the **father of psychoanalysis**.
*   One of the first psychologists to extensively study human motivation.
*   Lived in Vienna for 80 years, observing patients.

**B. Psychoanalysis:**
*   **Definition:** A scientific method for studying the human mind and neurotic illnesses.
*   **Core Idea:** Freud noticed patients' physical symptoms often had a mental basis, leading him to believe that many forces influencing behavior are **unconscious**. This formed the basis of his theory of personality.
*   **Development:** Developed his models over five decades, primarily through clinical studies of individual patients undergoing treatment.

**C. Mental Illness and Motivation:**
*   **Mental Illness:** Freud believed mental illness results from **nurture** (upbringing, environment), not **nature** (genetics, inherent traits).
*   **Motivation:** He questioned "What makes people do things?" His answer was **motivation**, driven by fundamental **needs** (e.g., food, shelter, clothing).
*   **Drives/Desires:**
    *   Being deprived of a need creates a strong feeling called a **drive** or **desire**.
    *   While animals respond instinctively, humans learn various ways to respond to these drives.
    *   Human motivation explains the underlying reasons for people's behavior.
    *   These drives, often unconscious (e.g., "will to live," "will to die"), can sometimes lead to irrational behavior.

**D. The Human Mind: Id, Ego, and Superego**
Freud proposed that the human mind has three interconnected aspects that influence behavior:

1.  **Id:**
    *   **Nature:** Entirely unconscious.
    *   **Function:** Seeks to bring immediate pleasure (**pleasure principle**).
    *   **Characteristics:** Contains primitive parts of our personality, including aggressive and sexual drives.

2.  **Ego:**
    *   **Nature:** Primarily conscious (**Rational Self**), but with unconscious components.
    *   **Function:** Deals with reality. Decides what actions to take based on what is believed to be right and rational for positive outcomes.
    *   **Characteristics:** Acts as a mediator between the Id's desires, the Superego's morals, and external reality.

3.  **Superego:**
    *   **Nature:** Largely unconscious.
    *   **Function:** Acts as our conscience. Reminds us of what we **should** do, based on internalized societal and parental standards of morality.
    *   **Characteristics:** Develops from societal rules and moral teachings.

**E. Conflict and the Iceberg Analogy:**
*   The **Id** (instinctive drives) and the **Superego** (moral conscience) are in constant conflict. For example, your drive might tell you to do one thing, while society's rules (internalized by the Superego) tell you something else.
*   Freud compared the human mind to an **iceberg**:
    *   **Tip above water (Consciousness):** Represents conscious awareness (mainly the Ego).
    *   **Vast region below the surface (Unconscious):** Symbolizes the unconscious mind, where the Id and Superego reside entirely, and a significant part of the Ego also operates.
    *   Only the Id is **totally unconscious**.

### III. Development of Science in Mesoamerica

**A. Mesoamerica Defined:**
*   **Geographical Area:** Encompasses the entire region of Central America, stretching from Southern Mexico down to the border of South America.
*   **Major Civilizations:** The Maya, Aztec, and Inca civilizations flourished in this region.

**B. Maya Architecture:**
*   The Maya were renowned builders, constructing impressive structures for various purposes:
    *   **Temples and Palaces:** Towering structures that dominated their cities.
    *   **Religious Centers:** Priests performed religious ceremonies and sacrifices atop the temples, with people gathering in the plazas below.
    *   **Other Structures:** Included ceremonial platforms, pyramids, observatories (indicating advanced astronomical knowledge), and ball courts.

Darwin’s contributions:
•Provided evidence that species evolve
•In 1859, he proposed the Theory of Natural Selection
to explain evolution  (Survival of the fittest )
•Over time, change within species leads to the 
replacement of old species by new species as less 
successful species become extinct . 
•Some evidence from fossils may prove that species on 
Earth have evolved from ancestral forms that are 
extinct . (species that have disappeared permanently.)

(1856 -1939)
•Lived in Vienna for 80 years
•Noticed patients’ physical symptoms seemed to have 
mental base
•He began to get the idea that most of the forces at 
work were unconscious
•From this came the foundations for a theory of 
personality

Freud -believed that mental illness is a 
result of nurture , not nature.
He asked the question:
“What makes people do things?”
Answer:  MOTIV ATION
Needs motivate human behaviour
(food, shelter, clothing…)


--- Page 64 ---
Being deprived of a need arouses a feeling called a 
DRIVE OR DESIRE .  Animals respond 
instinctively , humans learn various ways to respond.
Human motivation explains the reasons why people 
behave the way they do.
People have DRIVES OR DESIRES in the back of 
their minds
ie:  Will to live, will to die
Some of these desires cause people to behave 
irrationally.

--- Page 65 ---
People are born with a certain number 
of instincts or DRIVES (human 
instinctive behaviour )
The human mind has 3 aspects which 
influence behaviour :
Ego
Superego
Id

--- Page 66 ---
ID-unconconscious part of the mind 
(this part of the mind seeks to bring us pleasure )
-primitive parts of our personality including
aggression and sexual drives
EGO -conscious part of the mind (Rational Self).  Decides what 
action to take for positive means and what to do based on what is 
believed is the right thing to do. Aware of reality .
SUPEREGO -unconscious part of the mind that  
actsas our conscience . Reminds us of what we should do.
The ID and the SUPEREGO are in constant conflict .  Your DRIVE 
tells you to do one thing , while SOCIETY tells you to do something 
else.  


--- Page 67 ---
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, compared the human 
mind to an iceberg. The tip above the water represents consciousness, 
and the vast region below the surface symbolizes the unconscious 
mind. Of Freud’s three basic personality structures —id, ego, and 
superego —only the id is totally unconscious.
