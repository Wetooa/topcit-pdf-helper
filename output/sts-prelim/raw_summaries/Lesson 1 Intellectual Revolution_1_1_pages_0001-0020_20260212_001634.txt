# LEARNING GUIDE: INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTIONS THAT DEFINED SOCIETY

## 1. Introduction to Science & Society

*   **Goal:** Understand how Science and Technology transform society.
*   **Core Idea:** Science has always been deeply connected with human society. It's as old as the world itself, with no single identifiable start point.

## 2. Defining Science

Science can be understood in several ways:

*   **As an Idea:** It encompasses theories, systematic explanations, and observations about the natural and physical world.
*   **As an Intellectual Activity:** It involves systematic observations and experiments to understand phenomena.
*   **As a Body of Knowledge:** It is a subject or field of study dedicated to learning about the natural and physical world (e.g., school science).
*   **As a Personal & Social Activity:** It represents human efforts and knowledge aimed at developing a better understanding of the world around us.

## 3. Early Examples of Scientific Practices

Science has a long history, as shown by ancient practices:

*   **Trepanation:** An early form of brain surgery (making a hole in the skull), dating back 6,000 years in Cappadocia, Turkey.
*   **Sustainable Agriculture:** Chinese farmers practiced raising fish in rice paddies over 1,000 years ago, benefiting both the environment and communities.
*   **Mummification:** The process of preserving deceased humans.
    *   **Egyptian Mummification:** Practiced because Egyptians believed the soul needed to find and recognize the body to live forever after death.

## 4. The Scientific Revolution

*   **Definition:** A period of enlightenment (16th-18th century) in Europe where major developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry fundamentally changed society's understanding of nature.
*   **Impact:** It led to the emergence of modern science.
*   **Why Europe?**
    *   Invention of the printing machine, facilitating knowledge dissemination.
    *   Flourishing intellectual activities in learning centers.
    *   Growing number of scholars in various fields.

## 5. Pre-Scientific Revolution Context

Before the Scientific Revolution, explanations for phenomena often came from:

*   **Philosophy:** Provided ideas and explanations.
*   **Religion:** Used to rationalize the origin of life and natural phenomena.

## 6. Conflict with Traditional Views

*   **Resistance:** Many early scientific ideas were not accepted by rulers and religious leaders.
*   **Consequences:** Scientists often faced condemnation, and some were even sentenced to death by religious institutions.
*   **Perseverance:** Despite resistance, scientists continued their pursuit of knowledge about the natural world.

## 7. Key Figures & Revolutionary Ideas

### Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)

*   **Major Contribution:** Developed the **Copernican Model** (published 1543), which introduced **Heliocentrism**.
*   **Heliocentrism:** An astronomical model that proposed:
    *   The Sun is near the center of the Universe and is motionless.
    *   Earth and other planets orbit the Sun in circular paths.
*   **Challenged Previous Beliefs:** This model directly contradicted the dominant **Aristotle and Ptolemaic model** (geocentrism), which held for nearly 2,000 years and placed the Earth at the center of the Universe.
*   **Reception:** The Copernican Model was banned and ignored by Rome in the 16th century, judged as heretical and unacceptable for Catholic teaching.

INTRODUCTION
•This lesson will give light to the development of 
Science andscientific ideas in the heart of the 
society. The goal of this lesson is to articulate ways 
by which society is transformed by Science and 
T echnology .

--- Page 3 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Since time immemorial Science has 
always been interwoven with the society.
•Science is as oldas the world itself.
•There is no individual that can identify 
when and where science began.


--- Page 4 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Science  is interwoven with the 
society .
•Example :
1. The earliest example of brain surgery 
goes back around 6thousand years ago 
in Cappadocia, T urkey.
Trepanation -making an opening likea 
small round hole in the head.

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
2.Thousand -year-old agricultural 
practice : China's solution to 
sustainable farming.
The practice of raising fish in rice 
paddies byChinese
farmers , which is more than1,000 
years old, not only preserves the 
environment but also benefits local 
communities ,

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
3. MUMMIFICATION IN 
THE PHILIPPINES
•Mummification is a process 
of preserving a deceased 
human.
•Mummies are classified 
based on the method and 
the medium ofpreservation .


--- Page 7 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Why did the ancient Egyptians mummify
their dead? 
•The ancient Egyptians believed that when someone 
died, their soul left their body . The soul would then 
return and be reunited with the body after it was 
buried. However, the soul needed to be able to find 
and recognise the body in order to live forever.

--- Page 8 ---
SO, HOW CAN SCIENCE BE DEFINED?
•Science as an idea.
•It includes ideas, theories 
and all available systematic 
explanations and 
observations about the 
natural and physical world.


--- Page 9 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Science as an 
intellectual activity.
•The study involves 
systematic 
observations and 
experimentation s.


--- Page 10 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Science as a body of knowledge.
•It is a subject or a disciplin e or a field of study , 
it deals with the process of learning about the 
natural and physical world. ( school science )

--- Page 11 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Science as a personal and 
social activity.
•This explains that science is 
both knowledge and activities
by humans to develop better   
understanding of the world 
around them.


--- Page 12 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•People developed noble 
ideas, later known as 
Philosophy to provide 
possible explanation to 
certain phenomena.
•People used religion to 
rationalize the origin of 
life.


--- Page 13 ---
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
•Was the period of enlightenment 
when developments in the fields of   
mathematics ,physics, astronomy, 
biology and chemistry
transformed the views of society
about nature.
-Started in Europe.
-Explains the emergence or birth of 
modern science as a result of 
these developments.
-16th-18thcentury.

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION IN EUROPE
•Started as early 16thcentury up to the 18thcentury
•Why in Europe?
–Invention of the printing machine
–Blooming intellectual activities done in various places of 
learning
–Growing number of scholars in various fields of human 
interests.

--- Page 16 ---
RELIGION VS. SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
-Some rulers and religious leaders 
did not accept many of the early
works of scientists.
-Scientific individuals were sentenced 
to death suffered condemnation
from religious institutions .
-These did not stop scientists to satisfy their 
curiosity of the natural
and physical world.

SOME INDIVIDUALS &THEIR REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS
1.Nicholaus Copernicus
-Developed ( Copernican Model ) 
heliocentrism ,  it is the name given to the 
astronomical model published in 1543. 
-It positioned the Sunnear the center of 
the Universe, motionless , with Earth and 
the other planets orbiting around it in 
circular paths.
-Copernican Model was banned & 
ignored by Rome (16thcentury)
-idea judged to be heretic & 
unacceptable to be taught to 
Catholics.


--- Page 19 ---
•For nearly 2000 
years, civilization 
and astronomy was 
dominated by the 
Aristotle  and 
Ptolemaic model of 
the universe.


--- Page 20 ---
•Those views began to change with Nicolaus
Copernicus’ model.
