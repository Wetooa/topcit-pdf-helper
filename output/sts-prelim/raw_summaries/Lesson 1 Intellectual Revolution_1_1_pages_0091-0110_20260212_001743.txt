## Ancient Civilizations: Science & Contributions (Pages 91-110)

This guide summarizes key scientific and technological contributions from the Aztecs, ancient India, and ancient China.

---

### I. Aztec Science and Contributions

The Aztec civilization made significant advancements in various fields:

*   **Mandatory Education:** Education was a societal priority.
*   **Chocolates:** Aztecs were among the first to cultivate cacao and consume chocolate.
*   **Antispasmodic Medication:** Developed medicines to relieve muscle spasms.
*   **Chinampa:** Innovative agricultural technique involving floating gardens built on lake beds, greatly increasing food production.
*   **Aztec Calendar:** A complex calendar system.
*   **Invention of the Canoe:** Developed canoes for transportation on water.

#### The Aztec Calendar

*   **Appearance:** Often depicted as a large stone disk, featuring the sun god in its center.
*   **Purpose:** Used to predict or forecast future events.
*   **Cycles:** Operates on a 260-day cycle.
*   **Comparison to Modern Calendar:**
    *   **Similarities:** Both track days and have cyclical patterns.
    *   **Differences:**
        *   Aztec calendar has 260-day cycles; modern calendar has 365 days/year.
        *   Aztec calendar used for predictions; modern calendar primarily tracks days/months.
    *   **Influence:** The Aztec calendar has influenced the common calendars we use today.

### II. Development of Science in Asia

Ancient civilizations in India and China made profound contributions to science and technology.

#### A. India

Key rivers were crucial to the development of Indian civilization.

**1. Traditional Medicine:**

*   **Ayurveda:** An ancient system of traditional medicine, practiced before 2500 BC and still used today as an alternative medicine.
*   **Hatha Yoga:** A system of physical postures and breathing techniques for health and well-being.

**2. Key Scientists & Contributions (Gupta Era):**

*   **Varahamihira:** Contributions to trigonometry, optics, arithmetic, and calculation of equinoxes.
*   **Aryabhatta (476-550 AD):**
    *   Approximated the value of Pi (π).
    *   Developed the decimal system, including the concept of zero (0).
    *   Advanced algebra.
    *   Proposed heliocentrism (Earth revolves around the Sun).
    *   Provided explanations for lunar and solar eclipses.
*   **Sushruta:** Known as the "Father of Modern Surgery," author of the *Susruta Samhita* (a foundational text on surgery).
*   **Brahmagupta:** First to systematically use zero (0) and suggested gravity as a force of attraction.
*   **Madhava:** Considered the founder of mathematical analysis.

**3. Other Indian Contributions:**

*   **Invention of Pottery:** Early development of pottery techniques.
*   **Discovery of Cotton:** Cultivation and use of cotton for textiles.
*   **Modern Metallurgy:** Advanced metalworking techniques.

**4. Indus Valley Civilization:**

*   **Standardized Measurement:** Developed standardized units for measuring length.
*   **Mohenjodaro Ruler:** Designed a precise ruler.

*   **Architecture & Engineering:**
    *   Developed and designed sophisticated bridges.
    *   Invented the first seismological detector (to detect earthquakes).
    *   Developed dry dock facilities for shipbuilding and repair.
*   **Agriculture & Industry:**
    *   Evidence of early farming communities.
    *   Domesticated animals for food and clothing.
    *   Worked with metals to fabricate tools and farm implements.
    *   Developed the idea and method of producing silk.

**3. Medicine:**

*   **Acupuncture:** An ancient therapeutic technique involving the insertion of thin needles into the body.

**4. Astronomy:**

*   Maintained detailed records of celestial phenomena:
    *   Supernovas (exploding stars).
    *   Lunar and solar eclipses.
    *   Comets.
    *   Other heavenly bodies.

**5. Dynastic Contributions:**

*   **Shang Dynasty (First Chinese Dynasty):**
    *   Developed bronze containers and vessels.
    *   Produced silk for clothing.
    *   Established a system of writing.
*   **Chou Dynasty:**
