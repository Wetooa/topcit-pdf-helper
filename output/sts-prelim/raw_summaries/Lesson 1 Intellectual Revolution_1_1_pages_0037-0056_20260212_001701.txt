## **Learning Guide: Darwin's Journey and the Theory of Evolution**

### **1. The Spark: Publishing "On the Origin of Species"**

*   **Alfred Russel Wallace's Influence:** Wallace wrote an essay summarizing evolutionary change from his fieldwork in Malaysia.
*   **Darwin's Motivation:** Wallace's work prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own long-developed findings.

### **2. The Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle**

*   **Dates:** February 12, 1831 – 1836 (a 5-year journey).
*   **Ship:** H.M.S. Beagle.
*   **Charles Darwin's Role:** Naturalist (he studied plants, animals, and collected fossils).
*   **Destination:** A voyage around the world.
*   **Key Finding:** Darwin gathered evidence that led him to propose a revolutionary hypothesis about how life changes over time.

### **3. Observations on the Galapagos Islands**

*   **Location:** The Galapagos Islands are 500 miles west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean, directly on the equator.
*   **Significance:** Many of Darwin's crucial conclusions stemmed from his observations of wildlife here. (Note: "Galapagos" means "turtle").
*   **Finches: A Key Observation:**
    *   Darwin observed **13 different types of finches** on these islands.
    *   All Galapagos finches resembled a bird he had seen on the South American continent.
    *   **Key Difference:** The most distinct difference among finch species was their **beaks**, which were specifically adapted for the diets available on individual islands.
*   **Darwin's Initial Thoughts:**
    *   He questioned why, if birds were created for their specific environments, the Galapagos finches didn't resemble birds from similar environments (like Africa) instead of South America.
    *   He hypothesized that some birds migrated from South America to the Galapagos and then **changed** over many years.

### **4. Returning Home: Developing the Hypothesis**

*   **Island Variations:** Darwin observed that characteristics of many plants and animals varied significantly among the different islands.
*   **Core Hypothesis:** He proposed that separate species might have arisen from an original common ancestor.
*   **Fossils:**
    *   Darwin collected **fossils**, which are the preserved remains of ancient organisms.
    *   He noticed that some fossils resembled organisms still alive, suggesting a connection between past and present life forms.

### **5. Darwin's Theory: Evolution by Natural Selection**

After studying his findings, Darwin developed new concepts of change, leading to his groundbreaking theory.

*   **Evolution:**
    *   **Definition:** Change in species over time.
    *   Also known as **"Survival of the Fittest."**
*   **Key Concepts within the Theory:**
    *   **Natural Variation:** The natural differences that exist among individuals within a species.
    *   **Artificial Selection:** A process where humans (instead of nature) select individuals with desirable variations for breeding, leading to changes in a species over generations (e.g., dog breeding).
    *   **The Struggle for Existence:** Members of each species must compete for essential resources like food, shelter, and other necessities to survive.
    *   **Survival of the Fittest:** Individuals within a species who possess characteristics (adaptations) that make them better suited or "fitter" for their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.
    *   **Natural Selection:** Over time, this process results in changes in the inherited characteristics of a population. These changes increase a species' **fitness** (its ability to survive and reproduce) in its specific environment.

### **6. Darwin's Enduring Contributions**

*   **Evidence for Evolution:** Darwin provided compelling evidence that species evolve over time.
*   **Theory of Natural Selection:** In 1859, he proposed this theory to explain the mechanism of evolution (often summarized as "Survival of the Fittest").
*   **Species Replacement:** He showed that ongoing change within species leads to new, more successful species replacing older, less successful ones.
*   **Extinction:**
    *   **Definition:** The permanent disappearance of a species.
    *   Darwin's work explained that less successful species become extinct, and fossil evidence supports the idea that modern species evolved from ancestral forms that are now extinct.

Publication of Orgin of Species
•Russel Wallace wrote an essay 
summarizing evolutionary 
change from his field work in 
Malaysia
•Gave Darwin the drive to publish 
his findings


--- Page 38 ---
Voyage of Beagle
•Dates:  February 12th, 1831
•Captain: Charles Darwin
•Ship :  H.M.S. Beagle
•Destination: Voyage around the world.
•Findings: evidence to propose a revolutionary hypothesis 
about how life changes over time

•Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle
–5 year unpaid voyage
–Darwin studied plants, animals, collected fossils
–Found fossils of extinct animals that were similar
to modern species. On the Galapagos Islands in 
the Pacific Ocean he noticed many variations 
among plants and animals of the same general 
type as those in South America . 

--- Page 40 ---
This voyage lasted from
 1831 
 to
1836.


--- Page 41 ---
The Galapagos 
Islands lie 500 miles 
west of Ecuador in 
the Pacific Ocean, 
directly on the 
equator.
Many of Darwin’s 
conclusions were 
based on 
observations of 
wildlife in the
Galapagos Islands
 .
“Galapagos” means turtle.

--- Page 42 ---
Darwin noticed 
there were several 
types of finches on 
these islands
 .
In particular, 
Darwin observed 
something odd 
about the 
finches: they all 
looked like a 
bird he had seen 
on the
 South 
American 
continent.

--- Page 43 ---
In all, there were
 13 
types of finches, some 
species being confined 
to only one island.


--- Page 44 ---
The most distinct difference among finch 
species is their
 beaks, 
 which are adapted for 
the specific diets available on the islands.

--- Page 45 ---
Darwin wondered if the birds and other 
animals had been
 created 
 to match their 
environment, why didn’t these birds look like 
the birds of the African continent, since the 
environments of both the Galapagos and 
Africa were similar.


--- Page 46 ---
Darwin guessed that 
some of the birds 
from South America 
migrated to the 
Galapagos.
Once on the islands, 
the birds must have 
changed 
 over the 
years.

--- Page 47 ---
The Journey Home
•Darwin Observed that characteristics 
of many plants and animals vary 
greatly among the islands
•Hypothesis: Separate species may 
have arose from an original ancestor

--- Page 48 ---
Living Organisms and Fossils
•Darwin collected the preserved remains of 
ancient organisms, called fossils . 
•Some of those fossils resembled organisms that 
were still alive today.

After returning from the 
Galapagos and studying all the 
different types of plants & 
animals.  Darwin concluded 
new concepts of change….

--- Page 51 ---
Darwin extended these 
principles to biology, which 
helped him form his theory of…
…or
 Survival of the Fittest.
Darwin called this…
which means (
 change in species over time
 )

--- Page 52 ---
Natural variation & Artificial Selection
•Natural variation --differences among individuals of a species
•Artificial selection -nature provides the variation among 
different organisms, and humans select those variations they 
find useful .

--- Page 53 ---
Evolution by Natural Selection
•The Struggle for Existence -members of 
each species have to compete for food, 
shelter, other life necessities
•Survival of the Fittest -Some individuals 
better suited for the environment

--- Page 54 ---
Natural Selection
•Over time, natural selection 
results in changes in 
inherited characteristics of a 
population.  These changes 
increase a species fitness in 
its environment


--- Page 55 ---
Darwin’s contributions:
•Provided evidence that species evolve
•In 1859, he proposed the Theory of Natural Selection
to explain evolution  (Survival of the fittest )
•Over time, change within species leads to the 
replacement of old species by new species as less 
successful species become extinct . 
•Some evidence from fossils may prove that species on 
Earth have evolved from ancestral forms that are 
extinct . (species that have disappeared permanently.)
