    *   *Siddhanta Shiromani* (12th century) covered planetary motions, eclipses, conjunctions, and more.
*   **Mathematics:**
    *   Indus Valley Civilization: Earliest mathematical knowledge, standardized length measurement (Mohenjo-daro ruler).
    *   **Aryabhata (476-550 AD):** Introduced trigonometric functions, tables, techniques, and algebra algorithms.
    *   **Brahmagupta (628 AD):** Suggested gravity as a force of attraction, explained zero as a placeholder and decimal digit, and refined the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (now universal).
    *   **Madhava of Sangamagrama:** Considered the founder of mathematical analysis.

**2. China**
*   Major contributions in medicine, astronomy, science, mathematics, arts, philosophy, and music. Influenced neighboring countries.
*   **Traditional Medicine:** Centuries of experience and discovery of plant/animal properties (e.g., acupuncture).
*   **Technology & Inventions:**
    *   **The Four Great Inventions:** Compass, papermaking, gunpowder, printing tools (reached the West late in the Middle Ages).
    *   Other tools: Iron-plough, wheelbarrow, propeller.
    *   Designed different models of bridges.
    *   Invented the first seismological detector.
    *   Developed a dry dock facility.
*   **Astronomy:**
    *   Detailed records of supernovas, lunar and solar eclipses, and comets.
    *   Observed heavenly bodies to understand weather changes and seasons.
    *   Used lunar calendars.
*   **Seismology:** Prepared for natural calamities due to their understanding.
*   **Limitation:** Cultural factors (religious and philosophical framework) may have prevented Chinese achievements from developing into modern science by hindering the acceptance of "laws of nature."

#### C. Middle East Countries (Golden Age of Islam)

*   **Period:** 7th to 13th century (Muslim scholarship).
*   **Factors for Intellectual Growth:** Common Arabic language, access to Greek texts from the Byzantine Empire, proximity to India.
*   **Scientific Method:** Muslim scientists valued experiments over plain-thought experiments (unlike the Greeks), leading to the development of the scientific method and an empirical approach.
*   **Key Scientists & Contributions:**
    *   **Ibn al-Haytham:** Regarded as the "Father of Optics" for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light.
    *   **Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi:** Gave his name to the concept of the **algorithm**; **algebra** is derived from "al-jabr," the title of one of his publications.
    *   **Arabic Numeral System:** Originally from India, but Muslim mathematicians refined it with additions like decimal point notation.
    *   **Jabir ibn Hayyan:** Considered the "Father of Chemistry."
    *   **Ibn Sina:** Pioneered experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials.
