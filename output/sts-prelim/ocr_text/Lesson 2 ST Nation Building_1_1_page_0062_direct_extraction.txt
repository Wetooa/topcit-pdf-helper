Father of Microbiology Netherlands: 1632 -1723Improved the microscope -first to describe single -celled organisms
Created over 400 microscopes, 9 of which are still used today
. . . my work, which I've done for a long 
time, was not pursued in order to gain the 
praise I now enjoy, but chiefly from a 
craving after knowledge, which I notice 
resides in me more than in most other 
men. And therewithal, whenever I found 
out anything remarkable, I have thought it 
my duty to put down my discovery on 
paper, so that all ingenious people might 
be informed thereof. 
Antony van Leeuwenhoek.
