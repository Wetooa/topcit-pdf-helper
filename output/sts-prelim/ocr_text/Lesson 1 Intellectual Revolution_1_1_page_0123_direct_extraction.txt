One of the oldest mysteries surrounding ancient Egypt concerns the building of the 
PYRAMIDS . How did humans move such massive blocks of stone using only Stone 
Age tools? The Egyptians left thousands of illustrations depicting daily life in the Old 
Kingdom. Curiously enough, none of them show how pyramids were built. 
SEVERAL THEORIES attempt to explain how pyramids were constructed, but for 
now, the mystery has yet to be solved.
