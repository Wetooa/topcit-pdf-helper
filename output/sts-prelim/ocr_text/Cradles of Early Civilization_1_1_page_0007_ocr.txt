. There are numerous Muslim scholars who made significant
contributions in the field of science, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy,
and even in the field of social sciences. The decline of this golden age
of Islam started in the 11th to 13th century due to the conquest of the
Mongols whereby libraries, observatories, and other learning institutions
were destroyed.

Development of Science in Africa

Africa is blessed with natural and mineral resources. Science also
emerged in this part of the planet long before the Europeans colonized it.
The history of science and mathematics show that similar to other ancient
civilizations, the early civilizations in Africa are knowledge producers, too.

The ancient Egyptian civilization has contributed immensely and
made significant advances in the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and
medicine. For example, the development of geometry was a product of
necessity to preserve the layout and ownership of farmlands of the Egyptians
living along the Nile River. The rules of geometry were developed and
used to build rectilinear structures, the post of lintel architecture of Egypt.
These early science activities in Egypt were developed to improve the
quality of life of the Egyptians especially in building their early homes and
cities. The great structures of the Egyptian pyramids and the early dams

. built to divert water from the Nile River are some proofs of their advanced
civilization. .

Egypt was known to be a center of alchémy, which is known as the
medieval forerunner of chemistry. They tried to study human anatomy and
pharmacology, and applied important components such as examination,
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for the treatment of diseases. These
components displayed strong parallels to the basic empirical method of
studying science. ‘

Astronomy was also famous in the African region. For instance,
documents show that Africans used three types of calendars: lunar, solar,
and stellar, or a combination of the three.
