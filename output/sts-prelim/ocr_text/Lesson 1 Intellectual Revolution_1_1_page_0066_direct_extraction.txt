ID-unconconscious part of the mind 
(this part of the mind seeks to bring us pleasure )
-primitive parts of our personality including
aggression and sexual drives
EGO -conscious part of the mind (Rational Self).  Decides what 
action to take for positive means and what to do based on what is 
believed is the right thing to do. Aware of reality .
SUPEREGO -unconscious part of the mind that  
actsas our conscience . Reminds us of what we should do.
The ID and the SUPEREGO are in constant conflict .  Your DRIVE 
tells you to do one thing , while SOCIETY tells you to do something 
else.
