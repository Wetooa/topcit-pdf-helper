India is also famous in medicine. For example, Ayurveda, a system
of traditional medicine that originated in ancient India before 2500 BC,
is still practiced as a form of alternative medicine. They discovered some
medicinal properties of plants that led them to develop medicines to cure
various illnesses. Some ancient texts, like the Susruta Samhita, describes
different surgical and other medical procedures famous in Ancient India.

Ancient India is also notable in the field of astronomy. They
developed theories on the configuration of the universe, the spherical
self-supporting Earth, and the year of 360 days with 12 equal parts of 30
days each. Sama (2008) noted that their interest in astronomy was also
evident in the first 12 chapters of the Siddhanta Shiromani, written in the
12th century. According to Sama (2008), this ancient text covered topics
such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets;
the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar
eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon's crescent;
conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets
with the fixed stars; and the paths of the Sun and Moon.

Ancient India is also known for their mathematics. Bisht (1982)
noted that the earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the Indian
subcontinent appeared in the Indus Valley Civilization. The people of this
civilization, according to Bisht (1982), tried to standardize measurement
of length to a high degree of accuracy and designed a ruler, the Mohenjo-

daro ruler.

Clifford (2008) and Bose (1998) pointed out that Indian astronomer
and mathematician Aryabhata (476—550), in his Aryabhatiya, introduced
a number of trigonometric functions, tables, and techniques, as well as
algorithms of algebra. In 628 AD, another Indian, Brahmagupta, also
suggested that gravity was a force of attraction, and lucidly explained
the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal digit, along with
the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the
world (Clifford, 2008; Bose, 1998). Another Indian named Madhava of
Sangamagrama is also considered as the founder of mathematical analysis
(Joseph, 1991).
