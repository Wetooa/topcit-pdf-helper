Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, compared the human 
mind to an iceberg. The tip above the water represents consciousness, 
and the vast region below the surface symbolizes the unconscious 
mind. Of Freud’s three basic personality structures —id, ego, and 
superego —only the id is totally unconscious.
