Darwin’s contributions:
•Provided evidence that species evolve
•In 1859, he proposed the Theory of Natural Selection
to explain evolution  (Survival of the fittest )
•Over time, change within species leads to the 
replacement of old species by new species as less 
successful species become extinct . 
•Some evidence from fossils may prove that species on 
Earth have evolved from ancestral forms that are 
extinct . (species that have disappeared permanently.)
