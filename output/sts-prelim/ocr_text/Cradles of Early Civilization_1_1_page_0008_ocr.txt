Metallurgy was also known in the African regions during the ancient
times. North Africa and the Nile Valley imported iron technology from
the Near East region that enabled them to benefit from the developments
during the Bronze Age until the Iron Age. They invented metal tools
used in their homes, in agriculture, and in building their magnificent

architectures.

Mathematics was also known to be prominent in the life of early
people in the African continent. The Lebombo Bone from the mountains
between Swaziland and South Africa, which may have been a tool for
multiplication, division, and simple mathematical calculation or a six-
month lunar calendar, is considered to be the oldest known mathematical
artifact dated from 35,000 BCE. Ancient Egyptians are good in the four
fundamental mathematical operations and other mathematical skills.
They have knowledge of the basic concepts of algebra and geometry. The
Islamic regions in Africa during the medieval period was also benefiting
from mathematical learning, which is considered advanced during those
times, such as algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.

Scientific revolution is a golden age in the history of science. It
marked the birth of science as a discipline and as a field of inquiry and
gave birth to the development of the scientific method. It was a time
in the history of science where many scientific ideas and discovei'ies,
which were considered innovative and useful, were developed. Some of
these ideas were also controversial in the scientific community and in the
political arena. The scientific revolution significantly changed how people
study science and do scientific activities. It inspired human creativity and
critical thinking, moving away from thought experiments to data-driven
and experiment-based ideas. |

There were many intellectuals who made essential contributions
in science during the period of scientific revolution. Nicolaus Copernicus
developed a model of the universe in which everything moved around a single
center at unvarying rates, He placed the Sun in the center of the universe
and all the planets were surrounding or orbiting it. Copernicus's model of
