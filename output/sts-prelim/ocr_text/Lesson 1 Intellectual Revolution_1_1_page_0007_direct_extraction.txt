•Why did the ancient Egyptians mummify
their dead? 
•The ancient Egyptians believed that when someone 
died, their soul left their body . The soul would then 
return and be reunited with the body after it was 
buried. However, the soul needed to be able to find 
and recognise the body in order to live forever.
