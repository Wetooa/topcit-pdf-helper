Alg’ddle East Countries

The Middle East countries are dominantly occupied by Muslims.
With the spread of Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of Muslim
scholarship, or what is called the Golden Age of Islam lasted until the 13th
century. The common language of Arabic, access to Greek texts from the
Byzantine Empire, and their proximity to India were contributory to the
intellectualization of the Muslims and provided their scholars knowledge
to create innovations and develop new ideas. But contrary to the Greeks,
Muslim scientists placed greater value on science experiments rather than
plain-thought experiments. This led to the development of the scientific
method in the Muslim world, and made significant improvements by
using experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set
within a generally empirical orientation. A Muslim scientist named Ibn
al-Haytham is also regarded as the Father of Optics, especially for his
empirical proof of the intromission theory of light.

In mathematics, the mathematician Muhammad ibn -Musa al-
Khwarizmi gave his name to the concept of the algorithm while the term
- algebra is derived from al-jabr, the beginning of the title of one of his
publications. What is now known as the Arabic Numeral System oﬁginally
came from India, but Muslim mathematicians did make several refinements
to the number system, such as the introduction of decimal point notation.

Muslim chemists and alchemists also played an important role in
the foundation of modern chemistry (Durant, 1980). In particular, some
scholars considered Jabir ibn Hayyan to be the “Father of Chemistry”

(Derewenda, 2007; Warren, 2005).

In, the field of' medicine, Ibn Sina pioneered the science of
experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical
trials (Jacquart, 2008). His two most notable works in medicine, the Book
of Healing and The Canon of Medicine, were used as standard medicinal
texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe during the 17th century.
Among his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature
of infectious diseases and the introduction of clinical pharmacology (Craig
& Walter, 2000).
