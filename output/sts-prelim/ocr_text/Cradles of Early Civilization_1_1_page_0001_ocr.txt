Development of Science in Mesoamerica

Mesoamerica includes the entire area of Central America from
Southern Mexico up to the border of South America. There is no doubt
that the Mesoamerican region is rich in culture and knowledge prior to the
arrival of its European colonizers.

The Maya civilization is one of the famous civilizations that lasted
for approximately 2,000 years. These people are known for their works in
astronc)my. They incorporated their advanced understanding of astronomy
into their temples and other religious structures. This allows them to use
their temples for astronomical observation. For example, the pyramid at
Chichén Itz4 in Mexico is situated at the location of the Sun during the
spring and fall equinoxes. ‘

Mayan knowledge and understanding about celestial bodies was
advanced for their time, as evidenced by their knowledge of predicting
eclipse and using astrological cycles in planting and harvesting. The Mayans
are also known for measuring time using two complicated calendar systems.
These calendars were very useful for their life especially in planning their
activities and in observing their religious rituals and cultural celebrations.

The Mayans also developed the technology for growing different
crops and building elaborate cities using ordinary machineries and tools.
They built hydraulics system with sophisticated waterways to supply water
to different communities. |
