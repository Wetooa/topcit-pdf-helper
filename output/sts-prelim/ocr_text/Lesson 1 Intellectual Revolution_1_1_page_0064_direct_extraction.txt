Being deprived of a need arouses a feeling called a 
DRIVE OR DESIRE .  Animals respond 
instinctively , humans learn various ways to respond.
Human motivation explains the reasons why people 
behave the way they do.
People have DRIVES OR DESIRES in the back of 
their minds
ie:  Will to live, will to die
Some of these desires cause people to behave 
irrationally.
