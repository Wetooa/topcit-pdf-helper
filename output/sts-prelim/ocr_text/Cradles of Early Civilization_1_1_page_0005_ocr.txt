China

Chinais one of the ancient civilizations with substantial contributions
in many areas of life like medicine, astronomy, science, mathematics, arts,
philosophy, and music, among others. Chinese civilizations have greatly
influenced many of its neighbor countries like Korea, Japan, Philippines,
Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and other countries that belong
to the old Silk Road. '

The Chinese are known for traditional medicines, a product
of centuries of experiences and discovery of the Chinese people. They
discovered various medical properties and uses of different plants and
animals to cure human illness. An example is the practice of acupuncture.

In terms of technology, the Chinese are known to develop many
tools. Among the famous discoveries and inventions of the Chinese
civilizations were compass, papermaking, gunpowder, and printing tools
that became known in the West only by the end of the Middle Ages (Davies,
1995). They also invented other tools like iron-plough, wheelbarrow, and
propeller, among others. They developed a design of different models of
bridges (Zhongguo ke xue yuan, 1983), invented the first seismological
detector, and developed a dry dock facility (Needham et al., 1971).

In the field of astronomy, the Chinese also made significant records
on supernovas, lunar and solar eclipses, and comets, which were carefully
recorded and preserved to understand better the heavenly bodies and their
effects to our world (Mayall, 1939). They observed the heavenly bodies
to understand weather changes and seasons that may affect their daily
activities. They used lunar calendars, too. The Chinese are also known in
seismology. This made them more prepared in times of natural calamities.

China made substantial contributions in various fields. The list of
their discoveries and inventions is overwhelming. These contributions were
made along with mathematics, logic, philosophy, and medicine. However,
cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing
into modern science. According to Needham (1986), it may have been the
religious and philosophical framework of Chinese intellectuals that made
them unable to accept the ideas of laws of nature.
