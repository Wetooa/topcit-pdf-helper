<Table 52> Deadlock  occurrence  conditions  within a system (Deadlock  occurs  when certain  conditions  are met at the same time.)
Cause Details
As processes  occupy  a certain resource  exclusively,  other processes  cannot  use that
resource.Mutual  exclusion
A process  has been allocated  and is occupying  a certain  resource  but requests
another  resource.
The resource  allocated  to the process  cannot  be taken by force, and the resource
can be released  by the occupying  process  itself only.
Circular  wait The resource  requests  between  processes  form a circular  shape.Block & wait
Non-preemption
C) Solutions  to deadlock
<Table 53> Solutions  to deadlock
Solution Details
+ Use a protocol  that ensures  no deadlock  will occur ina system
+ Use this when there is a relatively  high possibility  that the system is likely to be ina
deadlock.
+ Prevent  mutual exclusion,  partial allocation,  non-preemption,  and circular  wait.
+ Avoidance  techniques:  Use the Wait-Die,  Wound-Wait  technique  that uses a
timestamp.Deadlock  prevention
