A sorting  method  based on the Divide and Conquer  method.

Selection  sort is one of the simplest  sorting algorithms.  The largest  element  is searched  in an array A [1---n]
and replaced  with the A[n] at the end of the array.
selectionSort  (A[ ], 1)
t
for last —n downto  2 {
The largest  number  A[k] is
Ak] < Aflast];
}
The for loop reduces  the size of the array to be sorted one by one. The array size begins as n and becomes  n-1
in the next loop, after which the size continues  to decrease.
