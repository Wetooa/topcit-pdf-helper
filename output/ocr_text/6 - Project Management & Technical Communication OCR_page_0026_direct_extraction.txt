@ Six Thinking  Hats
The Six Thinking  Hats is a simple yet effective  way to think, developed  by Edward  de Bono. In other words, it
is a method  of a group of six people taking different  roles and present  ideas that fit their roles, to approach  an
issue from various  perspectives  and derive the optimal  decision-making.
<Table 3> Composition  of Six Thinking  Hats
Type of Hat Role
White The role of Explain objective  facts or data in a neutral manner
Red Emotional  thinking
Black Negative  or critical thinking
Yellow Positive and optimistic  thinking
Green Be creative  and generate  new ideas
Blue Organize  results in a cool-headed  and objective  manner
@ Random  Word
Random  Word is a thinking  technique  devised  by Professor  Edward de Bono. Various  words are presented  until a unique
idea comes  out, and words are selected  and combined  at random  to create new connections.
@ SCAMPER
SCAMPER  is an analysis  method derived from the checklist  of Osborn, the originator  of ideation  method
brainstorming,  and revised by Bob Eberle. The term SCAMPER  is an acronym  formed from the abbreviation
of: “Substitute”,  “Combine”,  “Adapt”, “Modify”  or “Magnify”,  “Put To Other Uses’, “Eliminate”,  “Rearrange”  or
“Reverse”. It is an ideation  method similar to brainstorming  that draws out ideas at random, but it differs in
that ideas are generated  from a list prepared  in advance.
© TRIZ(Theory  Of Inventive  Problem  Solving)
It is a problem-solving  and ideation technique  created by Russian inventor  Dr. Altshuller  through analysis  of
tens of thousands  of existing  inventions.  TRIZ models a specific problem  into a generalized  issue through
abstraction,  then finds a general solution  model and derives  a solution.  Rapid and accurate  decision-making  is
the most important  for corporate  survival amidst the rapid changing  business  environment.  TRIZ objectifies
various problems  and contradictions  arising in the business  process,  and presents  innovative  solutions  by
applying  proven principles and solutions.
