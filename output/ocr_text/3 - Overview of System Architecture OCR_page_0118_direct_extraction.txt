Overview  of System Architecture )
the size calculation  target in the capacity  calculation  guidelines  is hardware,  which is defined as servers, not PCs
or other peripherals.  While there are several hardware  configuration  areas, the four areas - CPU, memory,  disk, and
storage  - are the most important  in terms of system  price and performance,  and they are defined by sizing areas.
+ CPU: Calculates  the CPU size to process  the necessary  tasks and selects  the server model that shows adequate
performance.
+ Memory:  Calculate  memory  usage by the system software  and applications  programs  for each server, based on the
server configuration,  according  to the CPU size.
+ Disk: Calculates  disk usage by the OS, system software,  database,  and database  archive/backup  for each server,
based on the server configuration,  according  to the CPU size.
+ Storage:  Calculates  the size of the needed  storage,  based on the server size, according  to the CPU.

C) Reference  architecture  for size calculation
Since the size is calculated  for each server, the person who calculates  the size needs to understand  the conceptual
model of the overall system architecture  that is to be implemented.  Most information  systems  nowadays  have
adopted  the 3-tier architecture,  as shown in [Figure  85].
