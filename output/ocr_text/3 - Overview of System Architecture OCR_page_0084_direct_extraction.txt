Overview  of System Architecture )
intuitive  GPI programming,  based on the C language,  and it enables  quick operation  using shared memory.  CUDA
consists  of CUDA Runtime  API and Driver API. Runtime  API provides user-friendliness  by automatically  allocating
necessary  values for settings  and others. Driver API, which helps the Runtime  API to operate, allows the programs
to directly manage  memory  or devices  without  using Runtime  API. The CUDA is expected  to show an excellent
performance  improvement  when applied to performing  tasks suitable  for parallel processing  operations  in various
fields that require  a large amount  of computation,  such as simulation.  Excellent  performance  can also be expected.
@ Open Computing  Language  (OpenCL)
OpenCL,  maintained  and managed  by Khronos  Group, is an open, general-purpose  parallel computing  framework
developed  by Apple, AMD, IBM, Intel, and NVIDIA. It is an industry  standard  programming  model for heterogeneous
computer  systems,  consisting  of GPUs, CPUs, and other processors.  It is a parallel  programming  model based on data
and tasks and has characteristics  of the open specification  to use GPU, CPU, and DSP. OpenCL  mainly consists  of the
OpenCL  compiler  and the OpenCL  runtime  library. Programs  running  on a computational  processor  (accelerator)  are
written in OpenCL  C language,  and the OpenCL  compiler  gathers  the source code to convert  it into a binary code.
Moreover,  a control program  to run or manage  programs  running  on a CPU is necessary.  It can be written  using C or
C++ through  the OpenCL  runtime  library.
@ C++ Accelerated  Massive  Parallelism  (C++ AMP)
C++ AMP was developed  by Microsoft  in an open programming  language  for heterogeneous  computing,  using CPU
and GPU. C++ AMP. when added to Visual Studio 2021, can increase  the execution  speed of C++ codes using GPU.
The C++ language-based  C++ AMP intends  to help developers  create general-purpose  programs  using GPU without  a
high level of understanding  or application  capability  about DirectX  API.
@ Open ACC
Although  the concept  and usefulness  of GPU programming  have been widely  known with the emergence  of platforms
like CUDA, it is not easy to write a program  that can expect  a significant  performance  improvement  by making
good use of parallel computing.  NVIDIA introduced  OpenACC,  a programming  model based on compiler  directives
that abstract  CUDA. Open ACC is a programming  model for higher productivity,  since it provides  a relatively  simple
programming  environment  for developers.  It has another  advantage  of having lower dependence  on an OS and
platform,  since it is a cross-platform  model, unlike the above programming  models.
02 Storage  Technology
A) Concept  of storage
Computer  systems  use a storage  unit to access data and run commands.  Although  a system uses main memory  for
the main storage  unit, it uses auxiliary  memory  to permanently  store and utilize data. The web server, WAS, and the
database  of information  systems  also need a storage unit as the permanent  auxiliary  memory  unit. The web server,
WAS requires a storage  unit to store its OS or the binary files of its application  program.  Although  the data used by
an information  system is stored and managed  through  a database,  the storage  unit is necessary  to ensure that data
