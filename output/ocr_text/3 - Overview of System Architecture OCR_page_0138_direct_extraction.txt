C) CloudStack
- CloudStack  is the cloud computing  open-source  project developed  by cloud.com  and managed  by the Apache
Foundation  by Citrix.
D) Kubernetes
Kubernetes  is an orchestration  platform  for container  management  and operation.  Google open-sourced  the
operation  know-how  that was developed  for its services.  Developers  can manage  and schedule  multiple containers
from a node with declarative  programming.  When a specific  configuration  is specified  through  the Kubernetes  Control
Plane, Kubernetes  automatically  maintains  the state.
E) Mesos
Mesos is a resource  management  project  that enables  that integrated  management  of cloud infrastructure  resources
and computing  engine resources.  It provides  a function  to group distributed  computing  resources  connected  by a
network  into a resource  pool and make it look like single computing  resources.  When a user requests  the execution
of an application  program,  it allocates an instance  and allows the application program  to run. Mesos consists  of the
Marathon  and Chronos  frameworks.  Marathon  allocates  resources  and creates  jobs, while Chronos  is responsible  for
scheduling.
