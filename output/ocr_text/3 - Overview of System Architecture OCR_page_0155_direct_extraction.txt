ESSENCE
It seeks to minimize  wiring work and maintenance  costs to compensate  for the shortcomings  of wired LAN-type
Ethernet.  It includes  IEEE 802.11b using the DSSS modulation  method  at the maximum  transmission  speed of 11
Mbps, IEEE 802.11a supporting  a speed of up to 54 Mbps by using the frequency  of the 5 GHz band and the OFDM
modulation  method,  and IEEE 802.11g  using the frequency  of the 2.4 GHz band to support  the speed of 54 Mbps.
IEEE 802.11n uses the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz bands and supports  MIMO (Multiple-Input,  Multiple-Output)  to increase
the transmission  speed up to 600Mbps.  Wireless  AP products  supporting  the speed of Gpbs have recently  been
introduced.  IEEE 802.11ac  supports  a theoretical  maximum  speed of 6.93Gbps  by applying  the 80/160MHz  bandwidth,
multi-user  MIMO/multi-spatial  stream MIMO, 256-QAM  modulation,  and beamforming.  IEEE 802.11ad  is a standard
that supports  the speed of Gbps by applying  various  technologies  in the 60GHz bandwidth.  The standard  for gigabit
wireless  LAN technology  to transmitting  UHD-level  video and explosively  increasing  wireless  data at high speed is in
development.

D) IEEE 802.15  standard
IEEE 802.15 is the name of the short-range  wireless  communication  standardization  committee  separated  from IEEE
802.11, which standardizes  wireless  LAN. It seeks to establish  wireless  networks  for mobile communication  devices,
PCs, and other peripheral  devices  in the home. Sub-organizations  include,  the WPAN (Wireless  Personal  Area Network)
research  group, for a maximum  transmission  rate of Mbps, and WPAN HSRC (WPAN High Rate Study Group), with a
maximum  transmission  rate of 20Mbps.
The leading WPAN technologies,  corresponding  to the IEEE 802.15 standard,  are IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth,  IEEE
802.15.3  UWB, and IEEE 802.15.4  ZigBee.
IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth  is a short-range  wireless communication  technology  standard  for exchanging  information
by connecting  mobile devices, such as mobile phones  and laptops. IEEE 802.15.3  UAB is a wireless  technology
that quickly transmits  a large volume of digital data through  a large spectrum  frequency  at low power in an ultra-
broadband  and short distance.  IEEE 802.15.4  ZigBee is a standard  technology  for home automation  and data
networks  with low data transmission  rates.
