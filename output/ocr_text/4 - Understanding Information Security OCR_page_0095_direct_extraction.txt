E) Procedure  of applying  database  encryption
A database  is encrypted  with the procedure  of [Figure 49], which consists  of prior consultation,  prior impact
analysis,  test verification,  build, and stabilization.

@ Prior consultation  for encrypting  a database
All stakeholders  participating  in the project  should consult  on necessary  matters  in advance  to share necessary
information  in advance,  such as the database  to be encrypted  to apply the database  application  security,  the
applicable  environment,  the security  policy, etc., before applying  security  to the DB application.
@ Analyzing  the impact  of database  encryption
In this phase, the operational  server is monitored  and the impact on the application  and DBMS is analyzed,
before applying  security  to the database  application.
This phase is one of the most important  phases in applying  security  to database  applications.  Before applying
encryption  to the operating  system, it is necessary  to perform encryption  pre-diagnosis,  such as extracting
encryption  targets and encryption-related  SQL queries in advance,  running performance  tests on the test
system, etc. Overall, the DBMS and application  are analyzed  in order to analyze the impact on changes in
performance  and system  resources  after encryption.
+ Selecting  an encryption  target
The encryption  target should be determined  by searching  the tables and columns  of the entire operating
DBMS to extract  the columns  needing  to be encrypted.
+ Analyzing  query statements
The amount  of data extracted  when executing  query statements  and the time of query statement  execution
should be analyzed,  and the query statement  expected  to need optimization  should be selected,  by
extracting  all query statements  used in all operating  DBMS.
+ Analyzing  DBMS
The resources  used by the DBMS, such as CPU, memory,  and storage,  should be checked,  and the appropriate
level of additional  resources,  that are required  when applying  encryption,  should be calculated.
+ Analyzing  applications
The application  modules  that are affected  by the application  of encryption  should be extracted,  and the
