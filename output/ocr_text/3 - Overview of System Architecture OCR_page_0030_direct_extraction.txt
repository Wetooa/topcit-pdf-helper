Overview  of System  Architecture
client. It is generally  the same structure  as the client-server  architecture.  Since the client processes  most logic, it
can be fast and easily implemented  when the number  of users is small. However,  the performance  becomes  poor
as the number  of users increases,  and the architecture  is disadvantageous  in terms of scalability,  reusability,  and
resource  use. Actual cases include application implemented  with 4GL tools, such as PowerBuilder,  Visual Basic, and
Delphi.

+ Three-tier  architecture
Three-tier  architecture  is a structure  created  to overcome  the limitations  of two-tier  architecture,  and it is also
called multi-tier  architecture.  This structure  has an additional  tier between  the presentation  tier and the data tier,
in order to process  business  logic to be flexible and scalable.  The problems  of two-tier  structures  include security
problems  due to the clients’ ability to access the database  through  the network,  the difficulty  of user authority
management,  and the difficulty  of changing  programs.  In three-tier  architecture,  the client does not have database
access information.  It is easy to manage  the database  object reference  authority  through  the application  server.
The distribution  of the separate  presentation  tier becomes  flexible. However,  the development  environment  is
complex,  and the cost increases  because  of the need to procure  middleware  and additional  hardware.
03 Server’s  Stack Architecture
A) Concept  of server's  stack architecture
“Server”  refers to a computer  or program  that provides  information  or services  to users through  a network.  It provides
the computer  power needed  for the information  system services.  The concept  of the server was created  when IBM
started making a server called the mainframe.  The term mainframe  refers to a large steel enclosure,  like a cabinet,
