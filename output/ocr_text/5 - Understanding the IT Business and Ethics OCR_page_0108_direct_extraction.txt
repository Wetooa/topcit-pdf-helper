C) Understanding  the SLA
The quality-of-service  issue between  a company  that supplies  IT services  and its customers  can become  a sensitive
subject  during the servicing  period. Therefore,  there is a need for clear guidelines  on the level of service between  the
party supplying  an IT service  and the party using that service.
The agreement  between  an IT service provider  and its customers  on the scope, item, form, performance,
measurement  methods,  and price of the provided  service is called the SLA. The framework  for continuously
monitoring  and changing/managing  the SLA (Service  Level Agreement)  is called SLM (Service  Level Management).
SOW SLM
(Service  Level Management)

[Fig. 43] Chart showing  the flow between  SLA and SLM
Statement  of Work (SOW) is a work statement  that specifies  the details of a service or the work described  in
the SLA that must be performed.  It is also used in project management  as a work statement  that describes  the
requirements  of the project.
