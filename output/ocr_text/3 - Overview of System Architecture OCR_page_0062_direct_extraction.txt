Overview  of System  Architecture
>> Recent  trends and issues
In computer  engineering,  computer  architecture is a conceptual  design and the operational structure  that
is the basis for computer  systems.  It is a blueprint  that functionally  describes  the design portability  and
requirements  (especially  speed and interconnection)  of various parts of a computer. It mainly focuses  on
how the central processing  unit (CPU) performs  and accesses  memory  addresses  internally.
Modern computer  structures  are based on the Von Neumann  architecture,  and the basic instruction
processing  structure  has not changed  much. Though parallel processing  and other technologies have
improved  in their performance,  only recently  have new concepts,  such as neuromorphic  chips and quantum
computers,  been introduced.
