06 Virtual  Memory  Unit
The technique  to solve the OS's limited memory  space problem uses the main memory  with a small capacity,  as a
large capacity  with a large amount  of free space. The virtual memory  unit is not a physical  device, but it logically  uses
a large-capacity  auxiliary  memory  device as the main memory  device. Therefore,  it is necessary  to map the address
of the virtual memory  unit to the address  of the main memory  unit in order to execute  a program  stored in the virtual
memory  unit.
A) Implementing  a virtual memory  unit
A virtual memory  unit includes  the virtual address  that processes  refer to and the physical  address  that points to
the available  main memory.  Whenever  a process  accesses  a virtual address,  the system must quickly convert  it
into the physical  address  through  the memory  management  unit (MMU).It  is divided into a paging technique  and
segmentation  technique,  according  to the block configuration.  Some systems  may use a combination of both
techniques  (see [Figure 26]).
+ Paging  technique:  This technique  partitions  the main memory  unit into fixed sizes, called frames,  and also partitions
the task to the process  stored in the virtual memory  unit into fixed sizes, called pages, and loads them into the
frame to run the task.
+ Segmentation  technique:  This technique  partitions  the task to the process  stored in the virtual memory  unit into
size segments,  which are logical units of various  sizes, and then loads them into the main memory  unit to run.
