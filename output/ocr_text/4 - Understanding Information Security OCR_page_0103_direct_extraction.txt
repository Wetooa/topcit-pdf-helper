Information  security )
Unnecessary  services  should be stopped,  because  unnecessary  system  services  can be installed  and executed
by default, and these services can become  a security  vulnerability  in the system, or they can waste system
resources.  It is recommended  not to use the service installed  by default, or the services  that are not used for
a specific purpose.  The system administrator  should accurately  identify  the purpose  of the target system and
remove  unnecessary  services.
+ How to stop unnecessary  startup  services
Input services.msc  into the search programs  and files box by selecting  [Start].
Stop the unnecessary  service  on the list and change  “Startup  type” to “Disabled”.
F) Checking  the terminal  service
Remote Desktop  Services  is a tool used to manage remote servers. However,  if a weak password  is used or
access control is not adequate,  it can be exploited  as a hacking  tool. Therefore, it should be checked  whether
unnecessary  Remote  Desktop  Services  is used or not. If Remote  Desktop  Services  is used, the encryption  level
should be set to “Medium”  or higher.
02 Unix-like  system  security
A) Overview  of Unix-like  system  security
Unix-like  operating  systems,  which are widely used as server operating systems,  include Unix and Linux-
like operating  systems.  Security  management  is needed in various areas, such as account  and password
management,  access  controls,  system  security,  service security,  monitoring,  and other security  management.
