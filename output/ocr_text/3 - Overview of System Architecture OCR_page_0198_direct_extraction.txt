01 What is Application  Layer Protocol?
Anyone managing  a network  system or developing  a network  application  program  often encounters  application
layer technology.  The application  layer protocol  is used to exchange  necessary  information  between  application
programs.  Widely used application  layer protocols  include FTP [1] for file transfer,  telnet [2] for terminal  connection,
SMTP [3], POP3 [4], and IMAP [5] for e-mail transmission  and access, DNS [6] for mapping  hostnames  and IP
addresses,  and SNMP [7] for network  management.  HTTP [8], which is used for data transmission  between  web
clients and webservers,  is also an application layer  protocol.  The BitTorrent  protocol  is also a widely used application
layer protocol,  although  it is a P2P (peer-to-peer)  protocol,  not a method  of accessing  network  infrastructure,  as
conventional  communication  protocol  does.
02 HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol)  is an application  layer protocol  for a hypermedia  information  system that
connects  text with video and audio files. It has been used for transferring  web contents  since the early 1990s [8].
The first version, HTTP/0.9,  was a simple protocol  for low-level  data transfer  through  the Internet,  but MIME-type
messages  have been defined and used since HTTP/1.0 (RFC  1945). HTTP/1.1 is the current  version in use and is
designed  to be more reliable  than HTTP/1.0.
Like most standard  application  protocols,  the HTTP protocol  implements  a request/response  protocolthat  is suitable
for a client-server  environment.  Since web browsers,  such as Microsoft’s  Internet  Explorer,  Google Chrome,  Mozilla
Firefox, and web servers, such as Apache HTTP Server, implement  the HTTP protocol,  users generally  have no
difficulty  using the web without  fully knowing  the HTTP protocol implementation.  However,  when developing  an
Internet  application  or a new application  protocol,  it is helpful to know text-based  application layer protocols,  such as
HTTP since they are good design and implementation  tools.
The HTTP protocol  uses a request/response  protocol.  The client sends a request  message,  in the form of <request
method,  URI, protocol  version, MIME type information  message>,  to the server, and the server responds  with a
status line that includes  protocol  version,  success  or error code, MIME type server information,  etc. to the client as a
response  message. Here, the current  HTTP/1.1  version is mainly used.
The method,  designated  in Request-Line  of an HTTP request message,  specifies  the HTTP protocol  operation.
Although  RFC 2616 defines  eight methods,  they can be extended  as needed.  The most commonly  used methods  are
GET and POST. The GET method is mainly used to search for content  in the server after accessing  a website.  The
POST method  is mainly used to deliver  user input information, such as a form, to a webserver.
Refer to RFC 2616 for more details on the HTTP response  message.  The Status-Code  information  of a status line
informs  how the HTTP request  message  has been processed.  Codes starting  with 2, such as 200 (OK) or 206 (Partial
Content),  indicate that the request  was processed  successfully,  while codes starting  with 4 or 5 indicate  client or
server  errors, respectively.
