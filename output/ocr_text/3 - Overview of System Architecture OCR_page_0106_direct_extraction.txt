03 Embedded  Software
A) Definition  of embedded  software  and technology  application
Embedded  software  refers to software  installed  in embedded  systems.  As the application  fields of embedded  systems
diversify,  embedded  software  is becoming  increasingly  complex  to handle  various  functions.
As shown in <Table 20>,
applications,  embeddedthe main technology  fields of embedded  software  can be classified  into basic embedded
middleware,  embedded  system software,  embedded  system development  tools, and
embedded  software  platforms.
Table 20) Technology  Fields and Examples  of Embedded  Software
Technology  Application Example
Basic embedded
applicationMultimedia  player, MAP viewer, browser,  PIMS, game, mobile shop, and CNS (GPS, GIS)
Embedded  middleware- Distributed  middleware,  such as CORBA,  COM XML, and TMO.
~ Java middleware,  such as JVM and J2ME
- Control middleware,  such as Jini, UPnP, and Havi
- Multimedia  middleware,  such as streaming  and codec
- Communication  middleware,  related  to WLAN and WPAN
Embedded  system Embedded  OS, device  driver, wired/wireless  communication  protocol  and multimedia  protocol
software support  library, and embedded  DBMS
Embedded  system Design  tool, test tool, IDE, target system  resetting  tool, simulator,  cross compiler,  real-time  remote
development  tool monitor,  remote  monitor,  and device driver toolkit
Embedded  softwareplatform MS .net compact  framework,  Sun ONE, Brew, and WIPI
B) Characteristics  of embedded  software
Embedded  software  is embedded  in a physical product  and continuously interacts  with the physical  environment.
In other words, it must continuously  receive and process signals from the physical  environment.  In some cases,
it is necessary  to receive the user’s requirements  and respond  to them, by considering  changes  in the physical
environment.  There are also cases, such as computers  and smartphones,  where it only responds  to user requirements.
Therefore,  embedded  software  has characteristics,  such as reactivity,  timeliness,  concurrency,  heterogeneity,  liveness,
resource  and environmental  constraints,  and determinism.  <Table 21> below shows features  of each characteristic.
{Table 21) Characteristics  of Embedded  Software
Technology  Application Example
Embedded  software  should continuously  interact  with physical  environmental  changes,  by
REEEBUBY converting  input data into output data at a specific speed.
Timeliness The time required  to convert  input data into output  data should be within the very short allowable
range.
Embedded  software  should be able to process  input data, generated  by the concurrent  physicalConcurrency -environmental  changes.
Heterogeneity Embedded  software  should effectively  process  data from hardware  or software.
