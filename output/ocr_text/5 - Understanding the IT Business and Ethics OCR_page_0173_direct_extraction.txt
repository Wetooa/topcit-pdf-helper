important  and the collection  of data that was previously  difficult  to collect will become  possible.  Consequently,  the
production  of customized  personal  contents  will become  possible,  opening  the floodgates  to new types of services.
The problems  facing wearable  devices  are short battery  life which severely  restricts  the user's ability to appreciate  the
value of always  wearing  the device, limited content  that can be implemented  in a small screen, and the lack of killer
content  or services  and the lack of a game changing  function.  However,  wearable  devices  will be able to create core
values if they converge  with loT, cloud computing,  Big Data, and mobile devices.  The sensing  functions  in wearable
devices  can be used for gathering  Big Data, Big Data (cloud) analysis can be carried out on the gathered  data, the
implications  from the analysis  results could be used in customized  services  for users. Also, new business  models like
smart home service  based on loT, O20 commerce,  and smart car service  will create new markets  and expand  existing
markets.
© Self-Driving  Cars
Self-driving  cars are defined as "automobiles  that can drive safely on their own by recognizing  the surrounding
environment  on their own without  the driver's intervention,  and can drive safely by recognizing  risks." To be more
precise, self-driving  cars incorporate  ICT technologies  like software,  Al, communication  and sensor  technologies  to
minimize  human control  while it is being driven safely.
The emergence  of self-driving  cars is due to the following  developments:
- IT companies  and car makers  are accelerating  their cooperation  to bring latest ICT technologies  to cars.
- The rapid growth of the electrical  parts and telematics  market in response  to demand  for better safety and
convenience
- Improvements  in network  and Internet  technology  allow cars to be recognized  as new mobile space and offer new
UXs to drivers
