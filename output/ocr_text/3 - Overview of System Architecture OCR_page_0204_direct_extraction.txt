Overview  of System  Architecture
In the transformation  process,  the JPEG uses DCT (Discrete  Cosine  Transform)  in the first stage of compression,  and
the decompression  uses the inverse DCT method.  The transformation  and inverse  transformation  apply 8 X 8 blocks.
The quantization  process integerizes  the real number  of the DCT transform  output and converts  some values to
zero. The coding process  arranges  data in a zigzag order after quantization  and before encoder  input, and lossless
compression  is performed  using run-length  decoding  and arithmetic  coding  [1].

Video data is composed  of several  frames.  Since each frame is an image, a video file requires  a high transmission  rate.
Video data can be compressed  with a spatial compression  or a temporal  compression  method.  JPEG performs  spatial
compression  of each frame, and each frame is compressed  independently.  Temporal  compression  removes  redundant
frames and configures  each frame into I-frames,  which are independent  frames, and B-frames  and P-frames,  which
reference  other I-frames  in order to compress  data temporally.
Analog  audio signals are digitized  using an analog-to-digital  converter  (ADC), and ADC consists  of two processes:
sampling  and quantization.
C) QoS (Quality  of Service)
Methods  for guaranteeing  QoS in a multimedia  network  include the RSVP (resource  reservation  protocol)  and the
TOS (type of service)  field utilization.  As shown in [Figure 141], the RSVP method  processes  data transmission  with
fixed network  bandwidth  allocation  from the source  to the destination.  The TOS field utilization  designates  the TOS
field class in each packet  to determine  the processing  priority.
