ESSENCE
it is possible  to communicate  relatively  accurately,  but in the case of writing, as it is difficult to communicate
in consideration  of various  environments,  a certain  format is required.  For example,  when writing  an email, you
need a certain strategy  for how to write it, such as a subject  line, a summary  of the important  points, a full
text, and an extra explanation.
The most important  type of communication  is gestures  (non-verbal).  It can be thought  that gestures  are less
definitive  than speech or voice, but not only logics but non-verbal  elements  significantly  affect the delivery  of
communication.

back, approach,  etc.)
For example,  if your voice is more attractive  than any other part of your face and body, like many successful
movie stars with good voice, it is easy to focus the other person’s  attention  on your words. Just putting  on a
bright smile on your face while talking to the other person  will help you achieve  a certain level of communica-
tion goals.
O02 Methods  of Business  Communication
A) Bottom-up,  top-down,  horizontal  business  communication
Business  communication  can be largely divided into two types: horizontal  communication  and vertical com-
munication.  Horizontal  communication  means communication  between  colleagues,  and vertical  communication
means communication  between  supervisors  and subordinates.  In each case, a different  way of communication
is required.
Vertical communication  can be divided into top-down  communication  and bottom-up  communication.  Top-
down communication  includes  instructions,  commands,  and deliveries  from top to bottom of the organization,
