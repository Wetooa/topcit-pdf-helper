Physical  data modeling  and database  design are performed  in the database  physics  design phase. Physical
data modeling  consists  in converting  the logical data model into a database storage structure  (physical
data model) by considering  the characteristics  of each DBMS to be used. Here, the concept  of physical
data modeling  and database  design can be summarized  as follows: Physical  data modeling  consists  in
designing  matters related to the structure  of data including  the physical appearance,  whereas  database
design consists  in optimally  designing  the physical model (design drawing)  as objects  from the DBMS
perspective.  Examples  of database  design include the plan for using the storage  space for each object
efficiently,  object partitioning  design, and optimal index design, etc. In terms of practical  business,  physical
design consists  in understanding  the denormalization  and performance  design for physical data modeling,
and in understanding  and applying  relational  table conversion,  table, data type, index, database  view, and
distributed  databases  for database  design.
