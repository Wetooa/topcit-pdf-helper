© Load balancing  technologies  - AMP, SMP. and BMP
Load balancing  adequately  distributes  jobs to the cores in order to increase the multi-core  performance.  The
multiprocessing  models include asymmetric  multiprocessing  (AMP), symmetric  multiprocessing  (SMP), and bound
multiprocessing  (BMP).
+ AMP: An OS is executed  independently  in each processor  core.
+ SMP: An OS manages  all processor  cores simultaneously.  Application  programs  can operate  in any core.
+ BMP model: An OS manages  all process  cores simultaneously,  and an application  program  can run on a specific  core.
F) Graphic  processing  technology
@ Graphics  processing  unit (GPU)
The hardware  specializes in computer  graphics  calculation  and is mainly used for the rendering  of 3D graphics.  Since
a GPU is configured  with thousands  of small cores that perform  floating-point  operations  processed  in parallel, its
performance  is superior  to a CPU that is configured  with a small number  of cores. A GPU dedicated  to processing
large-capacity  image data generates  results through  parallel  jobs using multiple  cores. Although  recent  GPUs were
mainly used for graphics  processing  functions,  they are evolving  into more flexible, programmable  GPUs.
@ General-purpose  GPU (GPGPU)
Based on the fact that a GPU shows high computational  performance  in matrix and vector  operations  that are mostly
used for graphic rendering, the computing  system intends  to utilize GPUs in the general computing  domain as well.
Many models  supporting  GPGPU  programming  have appeared.  They include  CUDA and OpeACC  from NVIDIA,  OpenCL
from Khronos  Group, and C++ AMP from Microsoft.

G) GPU-based  parallel  programming  technology
@ Compute  Unified Device Architecture  (CUDA)
In 2006, NVIDIA introduced  CUDA, a tool for GPU development.  CUDA is a parallel computing  platform and a
programming  model that can significantly  improve  computing  speed with a large number  of GPU cores. It provides
