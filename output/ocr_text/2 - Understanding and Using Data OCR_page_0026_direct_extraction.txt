@ Data independence  of two areas
As the concept  of data independence  can be separated  into these three phases, there are two terms that specify
the independence  of each area, namely  ‘logical independence’  and ‘physical independence’.

@ Relationship  between  mapping  and independence
The English  word “mapping”  can be translated  into “sasang”  in Korean,  which can be defined  as a “bridge  that connects
independent  concepts”.  Broadly  speaking,  there are two types of mapping  in data independence.

@ Roles of the database administrator  (DBA)
The DBA takes responsibility  for the configuration  and overall administration  of the database  to ensure that the
functions  of the database  system  are performed  properly.
