Log-based
techniqueRecovery  using log
files.Checks  all logs to determine
Redo and Undo.
Time delay.
Redo of the transaction  that
does not need RedoUses Redo and
Undo.Slow
Checkpoint
recovery
techniqueRecovery  using log
files and checkpoints.Relatively  faster recovery  speed
than log-based  recovery.Uses Undo. Faster  than logs
Shadow  paging
technique
B) Recovering  from a distributed  database  2-phase  commit  protocolRecovery  using
shadow  page tables.
© Transaction  of the distributed  databaseSimple Undo and no need for
Redo.
Fast execution  speed and
simple.
Difficulty in using it alone
when several transactions  are
executed  at the same time.
Used along with log-based  or
checkpoint  techniques.
Overhead  occurs  while copying
and recording  shadow  page
tables.Replaces  shadow
tables.Faster  recovery
from copies and
backups
+ This transaction  accesses  more than two databases,  and each DBMS can use different  recovery  techniques  and
transaction  managers.
+ The atomicity  of transactions  is an important  issue when building  multiple  database  systems.
+ If a certain transaction  is executed  across two sites and the transaction  is not professionally  designed,  an
inconsistent  state can be caused when one site completes  the transaction  while the other site cancels the
transaction.
+ The 2-phase  commit  protocol  should be used to maintain  the atomicity  of multiple  database  transactions.
