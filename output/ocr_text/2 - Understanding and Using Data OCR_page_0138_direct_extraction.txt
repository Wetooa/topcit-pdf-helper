+ Preview  for practical  business Why do we need to understand  data analysis?
Recently,  enterprises  in most industries  have begun using analysis  systems  for handling business  and
diverse  other various purposes,  such as CRM, SCM, etc, in order to analyze  accumulated  data from various
perspectives,  and to use the information  derived from such analysis directly in their business  operations,
including  management  decisions,  sales, marketing,  new product  releases,  etc. In fact, data analysis  systems
are becoming  increasingly  important  as the key system of enterprises’  business.  For example,  Mart A
analyzes  the shopping  details of individual  customers  and sends them personalized coupons  to induce
them to make additional  purchases.  Meanwhile,  Investment  & securities  company  B analyzes  the wealth,
age, residential  area, and investment  product  purchase  history  of its customers  and discovers  that “People
in their thirties  who have financial  assets of about KRW 30 million and live in rural areas are the most active
purchasers  of investment  products.”  Therefore,  the company  uses that information  to develop  company
marketing  strategies  and investment  products.
In addition,  markets  are calling for more and more experts  who are capable  of building  and operating  data
analysis  systems.
As explained,  data is very important  in these days. Therefore,  it is necessary  to understand  data processing
such as pre-processing,  loading,  analysis,  etc., and to understand  technology  about ETL, DW, and OLAP.
