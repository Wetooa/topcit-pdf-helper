reduction  of memory  prices, etc.
The MMDB has the following  characteristics  due to the fact that the database  runs in the main memory.
* Disk I/O does not occur because  all operations  are performed  in the main memory.
+ Performance  is good because  disk I/O, which degrades  performance  in the disk-based  database,  is rare.
+ Hardware-based  error recovery  techniques  are used due to the volatility  of the main memory.
+ Adisk is used for backup  and logging.
+ Hashing  and T-tree indexing  algorithm  optimized  for a memory  environment  is used.
+ Types of commercial  main memory  databases  can be updated  at [https://en.wikipedia.orgwiki/List_of_in-memory_
databases].
C) Embedded  database
General commercial  databases  are not suitable  for the embedded  system, which has limited memory  and special
performance  goals. The embedded  database  was developed  for the embedded  system, so as to allow specific
functions  to be used in a limited embedded  environment.
As aresult,  the embedded  database  has the following  technical  characteristics.
+ It provides  essential  functions  only after reducing  overheads  to use minimum  RAM and disk.
+ It supports  communication  between  different  devices  to allow communication  with the database  in a central server.
+ It supports  porting  to the various  platforms  of the embedded  system.
* It satisfies  the performance  requirements  of the real-time  OS of the embedded  system.
+ The list of commercial  embedded  databases  can be updated  at [http://embedded-databases.com].
D) Mobile database
The mobile database  is exclusively  used by mobile devices.  The mobile database,  which is installed  in a mobile device,
processes  the data generated  during field work and sends them to the central server for synchronization.  Due to
the distinct  characteristics of  installation  in a mobile device, a  mobile database  should be independent  from various
platforms  and operation  systems,  should recover  quickly from failures, and should be optimized  for a limited mobile
environment.
As a result, the mobile database  has the following  characteristics.
+ The database  can be installed  in a small capacity  device equipped  with a limited CPU and memory.
+ Itis provided  as an embedded  form that integrates  data and applications.
+ It has the function  of data replication  and synchronization  with the database  of the existing  server.
+ Commercial  mobile databases  include Sybase SQL Anywhere,  Oracle Lite, Microsoft  SQL Server Compact,  SQLite,
and IBM DB2 Everyplace.
E) Spatial  database
A spatial database  is a set of non-spatial  data represented  by letters and numbers  and spatial data represented  by
coordinate  values. The spatial database  was initially developed  because  a technology  for processing  “unstructured
data’, such as the geographic  information  system, was needed as a core technology  for a type of guided missile
that strikes a preset target by tracking  the target’s location  using geographical  information.  Thereafter,  the spatial
database  was introduced  full scale, as the market  was expanded  to include  services  that store and manage  values for
specific  locations  using geographical  information,  such as GIS and location  information  check.
The spatial database  has the following  characteristics.
