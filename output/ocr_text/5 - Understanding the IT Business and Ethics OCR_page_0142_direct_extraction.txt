@ MEAP (Mobile  Enterprise  Application  Platform)
Mobile Enterprise  Application  Platform  (MEAP) is a platform  that can support  a wide range  of different  device
environments  and permit  the sharing  and the reuse of applications.
+ The main reasons  behind the need for MEAP are reuse and cost savings.
- Allows the same code to be reused for different  smartphone  OS/smartphone  HW/service  provider  environments.
- Through  the sharing  of a common  platform,  companies  can save money that would others have to be spent on
duplicate  infrastructure  and middleware  required  for services.
- Support  for developing  the mobile screens  for different  types of devices.
- Support  for testing  and interworking

integrated  development  environment  (IDE), an execution  environment  framework  that acts a middleware, standard
interface  for integrating  with legacy  system, and a mobile device management  (MDM) for device management  and
security.
