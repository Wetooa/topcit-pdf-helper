@ Access  control matrix
Subjects  and objects are represented  in rows and columns,  and each entry in the matrix represents  access
rights. All relationships  between  the subjects  and the objects are managed  in a matrix. Since it is inefficient
to search a matrix to access a specific  resource,  it is divided into a capability  list and an access control list for
easy management.
