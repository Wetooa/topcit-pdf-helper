D) Advantages  of project  management  system
The following  advantages  can be obtained  by using the project  management  system.
@ Successful  project  management
You can get full visibility  into project progress.  In other words, it is possible  to see how far the entire project
has progressed  and what tasks remain in the future. Therefore,  there is an advantage  of being able to manage
the project  as planned.
@ Effective  team management
You can effectively  assign each task to team members  and manage  the schedule.  It becomes  convenient  to
assign the subdivided  tasks to each team and team member  and manage  roles, thereby  achieving  the goal of a
large project.
© Improvement  of organizational  competence
The history of the entire project in progress  is recorded,  and the deliverables  of each stage are registered,  and
the organization's  assets are managed.  This can serve as a reference  model when conducting  similar projects,
thereby  improving  the overall performance  capability  of the organization.

A) Concept  of project  monitoring  and evaluation
Project monitoring  and evaluation  is the process  of evaluating  whether  the project has completed  delivery
within the planned time period and whether  the cost has excessively  exceeded  the budget. The reason for
such evaluation  is: First, it is to evaluate  how much IT investment  has contributed  to the achievement  of busi-
ness goals. Second,  a project  retrospective  helps identify  whether  there has been any problem  in each step or
any issue that may be difficult  to respond  to, reflecting  it in future project  progress.  Therefore, project  evalua-
tion is generally  conducted  in three aspects:  first, a financial  perspective,  second,  a management  perspective,
