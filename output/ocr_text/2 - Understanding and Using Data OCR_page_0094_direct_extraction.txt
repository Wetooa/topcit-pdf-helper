Alan Greenspan,  the former chair of the Federal Reserve (FRB), said that “Bad data is invalidating  the IT
systems  of Wall Street. One of the causes of the financial  crisis is inadequate  data’. As the scope of the
information  system  operated  by institutions  and corporations  expands  and its complexity  increases,  data
quality - including  accuracy,  consistency,  and timeliness  - is becoming  a very important  issue. That is, data
quality control has become an essential  requirement  for the operation  and management  of information
systems,  and each institution  is making efforts to present  a management  framework  for data quality
and perform data quality control based on that framework.  Therefore,  it is very important  to accurately
understand  a data quality control framework  that can be universally  applied  to multiple  organizations  and
extended  according  to the characteristics  of a given organization.
