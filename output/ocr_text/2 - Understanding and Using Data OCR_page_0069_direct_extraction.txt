+ Preview  for practical  business How should normalization  be utilized in an
actual project?
It is quite rare that data modeling  is performed  as a series of tasks, such as identifying  entities  through
normalization,  and setting  and diversifying  the relationship.  It is also rare to prove an anomaly  by assigning
functional  dependency  to each table, as we did when learning  the theory of normalization.  Why, then, is it
so important  that we should learn the theory  of normalization  and remember  the theory  of normalization?
Learning  and utilizing  normalization  for practical  business  can be summarized  into two points.
The first point is that those who learn the theory of normalization  accurately  can identify  objects and
establish  a relationship  based on the idea of normalization,  even though normalization  is not performed
according  to the normalization  procedure.
That is, even though  data modeling  is not performed  according  to the process  of normalization,  those who
perform data modeling  are clearly aware of the theory and are naturally  aware of functional  dependency.
Therefore,  they perform data modeling  from that perspective.  Conversely,  those who do not know the
concept  of normalization  frequently  perform data modeling  that goes against  the first, second, and third
normalizations  because  they lack the concept  of normalization.  It can be understood  that normalization  is
utilized  by so-called  “internalized  inner forces”.
The second point is that the completeness  of the completed  data model is verified using the theory of
normalization.  It is really important  to test whether  the entire data model has stability for anywhere  from
50 to 2,000 entities  and relationship  attributes.  At this time, criteria are needed  to test this, and it becomes
the most important  theory of tool normalization  for the criteria in the data model. When we diagnose
the data models of a project that has approximately  500 entities, 10 to 40 normalization  violations
can be found. As such, many unknowingly  made normalization  violations  are found in many projects.
Besides  artificial denormalization,  there are many models  that are not normalized  without  forecasting  the
result. Data integrity  is lost because  such a model is applied to table creation  and then to the operating
environment.  As a result, the quality  of the business  data is deteriorated.
Therefore,  it should be remembered  that it is also used as a tool to verify the completeness  of the data
model that has been designed  based on the theory  of normalization.
