ESSENCE
for secure communication  in one direction,  two SAs are needed for two communication  entities in order to
establish  two-way  communication.
<Table 36> shows the communication  process  between  system  A and B, while the SA is stored. It is assumed
that system A initiates  communication  in this table.
<Table 36> Communication  phase in the IPSec environment
Sequence Description
Phase 1 System  A finds the SA of system  B by searching  for its own SAD in order to establish  secure communication
with system  B.
Phase 2 Check the encryption  key and algorithm  to be used, using the SA information  of system  B, encrypt  the IP
datagram  to be transported  using them, and insert a SPI into the IPSec header  and send it to system  B.
Phase 3 Check the encryption  key and algorithm  to be used using the SA information  of system  B, encrypt  the IP
datagram  to be transported  using them, and insert a SPI into the IPSec header  and send it to system  B.
Phase 4 Upon receiving  the encrypted  IP datagram,  system  B searches  for the corresponding  SA in its SAD using the
SPI and source  address  A in the IPSec header.

IPSec, using IPSec, also provides  security  for application  layer services,  such as secure
remote  access, e-commerce  security,  etc.
B) SSL
@ Concept
SSL is a protocol developed  by Netscape’s  Hickman in 1994 and standardized  by the Internet  Engineering
Task Force (IETF) after the SSL version 3.0 and named as TLS (Transport  Layer Security).  Most web browsers
support  SSL. The SSLprotocol  is positioned  between  the application  layer and the transport  layer in the TCP/
IP protocol  structure.  The protocol  is designed  to use TCP to provide  reliable end-to-end  secure services.  Even
though SSL can be us'ed in various application  layer protocols,  it is actually  most widely used by the HTTP
application.  When HTTP uses SSL, it is called HTTPS.
The two important  concepts  of SSL are connection  and session.
+ SSL connection:  SSLconnection  refers to transport  providing  appropriate  services.  A connection in SSL is a
peer-to-peer  relationship  and is temporary,  and all connections  are associated  with one session.
+ SSL session: An SSL
