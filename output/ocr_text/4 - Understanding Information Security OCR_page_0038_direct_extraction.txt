<Table 8> Types of biometric  authentication
Item Type Description
. . Semiconductor,  optical, and mixed types are available.  Fingerprint  recognition  occupies  the
Fingerprint
largest  market  share.
Iris Iris scanning  recognition  is very accurate  and fast, but it requires  an expensive  biometric
system.
cosy Face A face contains and provides recognition  information,  and is the most natural authentication
method.
Vein Vein recognition  checks the vein shape to recognize  the pattern.
DNA DNA is the most accurate  authentication  method.
Since a signature  has a certain pattern,  it can be identified  not only by the final signature  form,
i Signature but also by a kind of trajectory of hand movement.Behavior y jectory ;
Voice Voices are frequently  used by physical access control applications.
+ Process  of biometric  authentication
As shown in [Figure 17], the biometric  authentication  system  consists  of a “biometric  information  registration
system’  and a “biometric  authentication  system’.  The user's biometric  information  is stored in the biometric
database  in advance,  and authentication  is performed  by comparing  the data saved in the biometric
information  database,  with the biometric  information  extracted  from the user.

@® Multi-factor  authentication
As shown in [Figure 18], multi-factor  authentication  is a method of improving  the security  of authentication
by combining  multiple authentication  technologies  to supplement  the weakness  of a single authentication
method.
