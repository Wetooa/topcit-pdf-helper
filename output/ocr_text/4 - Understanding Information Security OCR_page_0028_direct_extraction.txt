@ Public key cryptographic  algorithm
The public-key  cryptographic  algorithm  became the important  element  of modern ciphers, since the
introduction  of the concept  of the public key cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1976, and the development  of a
practical  public key cryptographic  algorithm,  called RSA, in 1978.

[Figure  8] Public key cryptographic  algorithm
Unlike the private  key encryption,  the sender  and receiver  use different  keys to establish  secret communication,
as shown in [Figure 8]. The sender  encrypts  data, using the receiver's  public key, and sends the result over the
network.  The receiver  decrypts  the encrypted  data, using the private key that matches  the receiver's  public
key, to restore  the plain text.

[Figure  9] Key mechanism  of the public key cryptographic  algorithm
The public key encryption  system has the advantage  of establishing  secure communication  using the
cryptographic  algorithm,  even though the key is not shared with other users. Each user discloses  the key
that will be used to send data to them (called a public key), and has the key that can decrypt  the information
encrypted  by their public key (called a private key). Therefore,  it has the characteristic  that anyone can
encrypt  information,  but only those who have a private key corresponding  to the public key can decrypt  the
information.  For example,  when there are ‘n’ users in the network  environment,  a total of 2n keys are required
across the network  because  each user holds two keys (a public key and a private key). Each user must hold
