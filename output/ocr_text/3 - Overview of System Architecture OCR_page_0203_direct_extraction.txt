01 Multimedia  Network
A) Graphic  compression  type
Video data compression,  which accounts  for most of the traffic in a multimedia  network,  can be divided  into lossless
compression  (reversible  compression)  and lossy compression  (irreversible  compression).  Lossless  compression,  also
called reversible  compression,  refers to restoring  a compressed  image, without  information  loss of the original data
when decompressing.  It is characterized  by a lower compression  rate than lossy compression.
Lossy compression,  also called irreversible  compression,  refers to a compression  method  that the restored  data, when
the compressed  data is restored,  does not match the original data from before compression  because  some data is
lost.
@ Lossless  compression
Since the compression  and decompression  algorithms  are the exact opposite  of each other, the compression  method
preserves  the original data’s integrity,  and no part of the data is lost during processing.  Leading  lossless  compression
methods  include run-length  encoding,  dictionary  decoding,  Huffman  coding, dictionary  coding, and arithmetic  coding.

Compression  method Description
Run-length  encoding + Amethod  expressing  consecutively  repeated  symbols,  in terms of the symbol and repetition  count
(RLE) (run-length)
+ Amethod  that creates  a dictionary  while scanning  a message,  and if an entry character  string in the
Dictionary  coding dictionary  is found in the message,  the code value (index  value) of the entry is sent instead  of the
string
+ Amethod  that encodes  data in a binary  pattern  and allocates  shortcodes  to symbols  that occur more
frequently  and longs codes to symbols  that occur less frequently
+ Amethod  that maps the entire message  to a small section in [0,1] and encodes  the small section ina

@ Lossy compression
The lossy compression  method  compromises  some accuracy  in order to increase  the compression  rate, by allowing
the loss of redundant  or unnecessary  data. There are two types of lossy compression  methods:  prediction  coding
and transform  coding. The prediction  coding method is used for digitizing  the analog signal. Instead of separately
quantizing  the PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)  samples, it quantizes  the difference.  The difference values are smaller
than the actual sample  values, so fewer bits are required. The transform  coding method  transforms  a signal, from one
domain  (mainly  time and space domain),  to another  domain  (mainly  frequency  domain),  then compresses  it.
B) Multimedia  data
Multimedia  data includes  text, image, video, and audio data. The text has the form of plain text and non-linear
hypertext,  and the basic language  is Unicode  for expressing  symbols  and uses a lossless  compression  method.
In multimedia,an image is called a still image and refers to a photo, fax page, or video frame. As shown in [Figure 1],
an image is transmitted as  binary data, through  a transformation  process,  a quantization  process,  and an encoding
process.  The data is converted  back into an image, through  the reverse  process.
