03 Software  Development  Methodology
The software  development  methodology  defines each development  phase, the activities  to perform in each
phase, the deliverables,  the verification  procedure  and completion  criteria, and then defines the standardized
method  and procedure,  and support  tool for the development  plan, analysis,  design, and implementation  phase.
A) Necessity  of the software  development  methodology
© Improving  development  productivity  by accumulating  and reusing  development  experience.
@ Effective  project  management.
@ Providing  a means of communication  by presenting  formal procedures  and deliverables  and unifying  the standard
terminology.
@ Assuring  quality  at a certain level by verifying  each phase and closing  the phase after approval.
B) Comparison  of software  development  methodologies
