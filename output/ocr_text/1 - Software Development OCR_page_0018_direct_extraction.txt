development  and management  capabilities?
“Software  is devouring  the world.”
These words accurately  describe  the current  situation  facing companies.  As we enter the intelligent
information  society represented  by Industry  4.0, software  has emerged  as a key driver of digital
transformation  and enterprises  have their competitors  strained in the industry  by creating  a new
business  model that did not exist before the widespread  adoption  of software.  We can see evidence
for this in the way that Uber and Airbnb have stablished  themselves  as the providers  of the world’s
largest transportation  service and its largest accommodation  service, respectively,  even though
they do not own any cars or hotels. As a result, many enterprises  all over the world are trying to
strengthen their software  capabilities  for digital business.  The impact is so far-reaching  that even
the manufacturing  company  GE and the financial company  Goldman  Sachs also see themselves  as
software  companies.  We can easily find evidence  of the newly elevated  status of software  all around
us. Artificial  intelligence  (Al) is the most representative  example.  “AlphaGo’,  which was introduced
to the world by Google DeepMind  a few years ago, became  an important  measure  by which we can
estimate the extent  to which the power of software  will develop.  At present,  Al enriches  our lives
considerably  as it is utilized in diverse fields in our daily lives, such as communication,  education,
shopping,  entertainment,  vehicle  management,  etc.
Autonomous  driving, which has been actively  researched  and developed  throughout  the world,
also belongs  to the software  domain. Until very recently,  mechanical  engineering  elements  had a
dominant  place in the car and electric  apparatus  industries,  which were even referred  to as the “flowers
of the manufacturing  sector’. However,  more than half of the industries  are now composed  of
software  code. In particular,  the car industry  depends  increasingly  heavily on software  as self-driving
technology  is increasingly  incorporated  into new models.
Even though such important  software  is increasingly  being used in more areas, the pertinent  question
is whether  software  quality is being managed,  and productivity  being improved,  in proportion  to
the increased  use. In particular,  it is necessary  to examine  whether  software  functions  are working
properly  as the use of software  is increasing  even in areas directly  related to human life or property,
such as autonomous  driving. However,  the reality is that software  quality cannot be considered  in
the domestic  software  industry.  For example,  more mobile apps are now used as smartphones  have
become  so popular. However,  these mobiles  apps are not used by a single user but rather are called
by several users at the same time. Therefore, unintended  defects  can occur while seeking  to improve
service  efficiency.
