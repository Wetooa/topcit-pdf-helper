According  to a 2010 survey by the Ministry  of the Interior  and Safety, 4.4 percent  of the additional  costs
incurred due to excessive  work changes  were borne by central administrative  agencies,  while 15.3 percent
were borne by  local governments.  These results have raised concems  that the planning  and design of
information  systems  for deployment  in the public sector  are performed  poorly.
Legislation  has been passed requiring  the issuance  of a detailed  RFP and the PMO program  when an
organization  seeks to deploy an IT business.  However,  the findings  from surveys like the one described
above suggest  that people are still not aware of the benefits  of deploying  an information  system and that
most people also lack expertise.
Recently,  the government  has been working  on introducing  a “split order process”  for the purpose  of
preventing  irresponsible  work changes  and eradicating  the unfair subcontracting  structure  which involves
the ordering  agency,  bidding  company,  and sub-contractor
The split order process  roughly means that when an IT business is adopted,  planning/design  is split from
deployment/development.  In the planning/design  phase, a more detailed requirement  analysis of the
Information  Strategy  Plan (ISP) is carried out with the information  system master  plan (ISMP) and the basic
design (logical design). In the deployment/development  phase, detailed  design (physical  design), system
development  (coding),  and testing  are carried out.
Many have voiced their concerns  about the adoption  of the split order process.  Nevertheless,  it is
significant  in that an environment  can be created in which planning  and design can be done more
meticulously  and systematically.  This environment  can also overcome  the invisibility  of software and lead
people  to understand  how frequent  changes  in requirements  can act as impediments  to the adoption  of IT
business.
