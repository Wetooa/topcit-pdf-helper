01 Types of Databases
A) Development  process  of the database
The hierarchical  and network  databases  that developed  the data structure  used in existing  applications  were the
main types of database  used in the early days. However,  these databases  had a big problem  in that it was difficult  to
maintain  consistency.  To resolve these problems,  relational  databases  appeared  in the 1970s. Since then, databases
have developed  continuously  around relational  database  technology.
In the 1990s, user-defined  data and multimedia  data needed  to be managed,  but existing  relational  data models  could
not handle such complex  data. Accordingly,  an object-oriented  database  combining  object-oriented  technology,  which
began to gain attention  from the mid-1980s,  and a database  appeared.  Since then, an object-oriented  database
that combines  the advantages  of both the relational  database  and the object-oriented  database  has appeared  and
been widely used until now. Databases  are evolving  from simple business  applications  to large-capacity  and complex
business  environment  supports  to respond  to changes  in the IT market  and technology,  such as the XML database,
which emerged  as a response  to the development  of the Internet  environment,  and the NoSQL,  which was developed
to process  big data.

B) Major  types of databases
@ Hierarchical  database
A hierarchical  database  hierarchically  stores data in a tree format of the relationship  between  subordinates  and
superiors. Although  this database  has the advantages  of rapid data access and easy prediction  of data usage, it
cannot  adapt to changing  business  processes  easily.
The major characteristics  of the hierarchical  database  are as follows.
+ Itis the oldest  database  with a hierarchical  structure  (1960s).
+ Each hierarchical  structure  maintains  a dependent  relationship  by connecting  with physical  pointers.
+ Itis difficult  to change  the data structure  when the business  process  is changed  after building  a database.
