ESSENCE
“maintenance  personnel”  often refers to each individual  who performs  maintenance  activities,  so as to distinguish  them from
developers.  Maintenance  personnel  can learn much from developers  who have a deep knowledge  of the software  concerned.
If maintenance  personnel  meet developers  or participate  in development  from the beginning,  maintenance  can be reduced.
Sometimes  maintenance  personnel  become  perplexed  because  the software  engineer  in charge has moved to another  job
or is out of contact.  Maintenance  personnel  should take over and immediately  support  the developed  product  (e.g. code or
document),  and evolve and maintain  the developed  product  throughout  the entire software  life cycle.
The table below shows  the various  subjects  for each activity  in the general  maintenance  phase. Each activity  subject  performs
and bears the responsibility  for the maintenance  activity  concerned.  The maintenance  management  committee  approves  or
rejects  the maintenance  of changes,  and finally reviews  and approves  the applied  change.

The table below describes  the types of software  maintenance  organizations.  The “organization  by application
field” is the most frequently  applied  type - mainly to fields requiring  knowledge  about the application  business.
