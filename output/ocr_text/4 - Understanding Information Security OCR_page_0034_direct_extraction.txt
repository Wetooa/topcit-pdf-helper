+ Encryption  based on the password
Both the hash function  and encryption  are techniques  of hiding the password  effectively.  However,  there is a
difference,  in that the encryption  algorithm  can encrypt  the unencrypted  plaintext  and then decrypt  it again,
whereas  the hash function  cannot  find the original value of the hash function  using the result value.
The hash function  can be used for password-based  encryption  (PBE). In PBE, the hash value, which is
obtained  by entering  the result of combining  the password and salt (random number  generated  using a
pseudo-random  number  generator)  into the hash function,  is used as an encryption  key. Attacks  against  the
password  can be prevented  using this method.
+ Electronic  signature
The hash function  can be used for digital signatures.  A digital signature  is a method of providing both data
integrity  and the signature’s  authentication  by performing  a hash operation  on a specific  document,  using the
signature’s  private key. Signing  the entire message  is very inefficient  because  the public key operation  should
be repetitively  performed  on all message  blocks. Therefore,  an electronic  signature  can be very efficiently
generated  by calculating  a hash value for the message  and signing  on that value. Although  the signer  signed
the hash value, instead of the message  itself, this signature  is recognized  as a genuine signature  for the
message  because  finding  another  message  with the same hash value is difficult.
O2 Authentication  technology
A) Concept  of authentication
Authentication  refers to a method  of verifying  whether  the information  exchanged  between  the sender and
receiver,  who are the subject of the information,  has not been altered or deleted,  and whether  the subject
