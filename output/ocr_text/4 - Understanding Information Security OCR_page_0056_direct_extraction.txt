O2 Security  trends related  to the latest information  technology
A) loT security
@ Overview  on loT security
Security  is a core technology  that must be provided  to promote  loT technology  and to create new services.
As the number  of devices connected to the Internet  increases,  the number  of attack targets and threat
elements  also increase.  In particular,  security  technology  is indispensable  for loT devices and communication
technologies  that are applied  to healthcare  services  or industrial  facility  control services,  because  an injury can
occur beyond simple economic  damage, if the security  of the service is breached.  In addition,  when ordinary
things around us are connected  to the Internet,  the range of concerns  about personal  information  leakage  or
privacy invasion  increases.  It is also obvious  that the level of breach will increase  beyond  comparison  with the
present.
Security  and privacy  protection systems  should be considered  from the design and development  phase of the
loT device and service. In addition,  it should be possible  to block potential  security  threats in advance  in the
loT device deployment  and installation  phase. Potential  security  threats and vulnerabilities  should be checked,
and security  should be applied throughout  the entire lifecycle  of the loT device, such as the setup, operation,
and execution  phase, when the device is actually  used, and during  the destruction  phase.
® Applying  security  to the design/development  phase of the loT device
+ Security  by design
A method should be considered  that can reduce the weight of the loT device while minimizing  the misuse
of information  and device, such as confidentiality,  integrity/authentication,  and availability,  considering  the
low power/low  performance  characteristics  of the loT device. The loT service should provide a method of
managing  device access rights, end-to-end  communication  security,  and providing integrity/authentication
that is suitable  for the service operating  environment  for the loT device and information.  The application  of
software  security  technology  and hardware  security  technology  should be actively  reviewed,  and standard
security  technology,  with proven safety, should be used.
+ Privacy  by design
The privacy  protection methodology  of the user should be applied  to the loT device and loT service  operation
policy by default. The method of encrypted  transmission,  anonymous  storage,  and integrity/authentication
application  should be included  in the privacy information  collected  by the loT device. The loT service should
include the method of de-identification,  access control/authentication,  confidentiality,  and secure storage
of collected  privacy information.  loT service providers  should guarantee  transparency  to the maximum  by
visualizing  the operation  policy, including  the scope and period  of privacy  information  use, to the user.
© Applying  and verifying  the secure S/W and H/W development  technology.
Secure coding, software  and application  security  verification,  and secure hardware  device should be used when
designing  and developing  loT products  and services.
