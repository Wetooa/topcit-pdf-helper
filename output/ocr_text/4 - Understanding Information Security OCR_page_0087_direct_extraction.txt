A) Overview  of database  security
@ Three  principles  of database  security
Database  security  means taking administrative,  physical,  and technical  protection  measures  in order to secure
confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  from the threat of leakage,  change, or destruction  of organizational
database  information.
In the past, the performance  of DB was emphasized,  but safe management  and data protection  is becoming
especially  important  in recent years, which proves that the value of data is increasing  with the advancement
of IT services.  Since the database  collects and stores a large amount  of data, from personal  information,  to
corporate  confidential  information,  it is an important  asset to protect  for an organization,  and a key target for
attackers.

+ Database  security  for sustainable  management
Recently,  personal  information  leakage incidents  have occurred  in succession,  such as H capital, S portal, N

prerequisite  for sustainable  management  because  enormous  economic  loss, along with a decline in customer
trust, can threaten  the foundation  of a business,  if database  information  is leaked.
+ Database  security  for responding  to regulations
Recently,  the importance  of database  security  has been emphasized  because  it is mandated  by related laws,
such as the Personal  Information  Protection  Act, the Information  Communication  Network  Act, the Electronic
Financial  Transaction  Act, etc., in addition  to the importance  of personal  information  protection.
