01 Stored  Procedure
A) Definition  of the stored procedure
A stored procedure  is a set of queries  for executing  a series of queries like a single function.  The stored procedure
organizes  a series of operations  in a database  and stores the result in a relational  database  management  system,  and
is also called a “persistent  storage  module”.
B) Strengths  and weaknesses  of the stored procedure
Most DBMS vendors  provide a function  that can describe  a procedure  using an extended language  of the
specifications  for static and dynamic  SQL, including  cursor handling  and control statements,  exception  handling,  etc.
The external  procedure  function  is also implemented  by calling a function  or a class method  from an external  module
(shared  libraries)  compiled  based on C language  and Java class libraries.
C) Strengths  of the stored procedure
+ Reduces  the network  load by executing  several SQL statements  using a single request.
+ Reduces  the processing  time as syntax analysis  and internal intermediate  code conversion  are performed  in
advance.
+ Maintains  the referential  integrity  of data with complex  rules by combining  it with a trigger.
+ Improves  the readability  of the source code as the host  language like Java and SQL statements  are clearly
distinguished.
+ Easy to maintain  as the website  can be modified  during operation  by replacing  the stored procedures.
D) Shortcomings  of the stored procedure
+ Reusability  is low as a code asset because  products  are less compatible.
+ The definition  of the stored procedure  needs to be changed  together  with the external  application program  when
work is changed,  which is used as a part of the business  logic. That is, additional  efforts are needed  when a change
occurs, and a failure may occur due to mistakes  in the change  process.
02 Embedded  SQL
A) Definition  of embedded  SQL
When an SQL statement  that defines  or accesses  data is included  in an application  program  code such as PASCAL,
COBOL,  C, C++, Visual Basic, Java, etc. and executed  together  at the time of program  execution,  the inserted  SQL
statement  is called an “embedded  SQL”, and the application  program  is called a “host program’.
B) Characteristics  of embedded  SQL
@ Embedded  SQL statements  can be used anywhere  in the host program  code if there is an execute  statement.  A
