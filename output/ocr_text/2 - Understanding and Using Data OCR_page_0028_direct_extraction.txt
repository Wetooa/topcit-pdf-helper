Database
+ Controls  access  to data by unauthorized  users.
+ Provides  various  types of interfaces  to diverse  users.
+ Expresses  the complex  relationships  that exist between  data.
+ Ensures  the integrity  of the database.
© Conceptual  diagram  and main functions  of the DBMS
There is a file structure  that stores a database,  and memory  and major processes  to process  the file structure  in
DBSM.

<Table 10> DBMS components
Component Description
+ Processes  the schema  specified  in the DDL as an internal  schema,  i.e. metadata,  and stores it in
DDL compiler the system  catalog.
+ All DBMS modules  should access  and use this catalog  information  when necessary.
Processes  advanced  queries  submitted  by general  users. le. queries  are analyzed,  parsed,  and
Query processor compiled.  Then, the database  access  code is created  and sent to the runtime  DB handler  for
execution.
DML commands  inserted  into an application  program  are extracted  and sent to the DML compiler
to be compiled  as an object  code for database  access.DML pre-compiler
DML compiler ADML  compiler  generates  an object code by parsing  and compiling  the received  DML command.
Runtime  database Database  access  is managed  at runtime.  That is, database  operations  such as search or update
handler are executed  in the database  using the storage  data manager.
+ The transaction  manager  checks  compliance  with integrity  constraints  and the user's rights
Transaction  manager while accessing  the database.
+ Performs  restoration  when controlling  transactions  concurrently  or when a failure  occurs.
The stored data manager  manages  access  to the user database  and catalog  stored in the disk.
