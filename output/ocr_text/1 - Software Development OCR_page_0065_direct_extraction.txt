01 Software  Architecture  Design
A) Software  architecture  overview
Software  architecture  can be regarded  as a blueprint  which is used to systematically  handle various factors
that directly or indirectly  affect the development  of software  and increase  complexity.  The definition  of
software  architecture  can be expressed  in various ways. Booch defined architecture  as “a set of important
decision-making  rules about the software  structure’.  Myron Ahn[4] said that we can judge various things
from software  architecture,  such as modules,  processes,  data, and their structure;  the relationships  between
components;  the method  of extending  and modifying  these components  and relationships:  the components  of
the technology  in use; and the method  of implementing  and modifying  the flexibility  and performance  of the
system. When starting  a project, software  architecture  is used as a means of communication  and a decision-
making tool, and is also considered  when determining  the overall system structure  and organization  of a
development  project.

B) Software  architecture  design procedure
Software  architecture  is designed  by the procedure  of requirements  analysis,  architecture  analysis  and design,
and architecture  verification  and approval.
Requirements  are specifically  identified through  request  for proposals,  interviews,  and meetings,  and functional
and non-functional  requirements  are classified  and specified. During  the architecture  analysis  procedure,  quality
factors should be identified and prioritized.  Then, architectural  styles and candidate  architectures  are identified
and processed  when designing  architecture.  Architecture  selected  in this way is evaluated  and detailed,  and
