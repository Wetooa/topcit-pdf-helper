Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
When pursuing  an IT business,  investment  in IT must be executed  in accordance  with the business  strategy  of the
enterprise  in question;  and analyses  of the effectiveness  of IT investments  must be fed back into the IT business
performance  evaluation.
The evaluation  of IT business  performance  can be broadly  divided into financial  performance  evaluation  and balanced
score card assessment.  Financial  performance  evaluation  is a technique  for quantitatively  evaluating  the performance
of a financial investment  by analyzing  the financial  benefits.  In addition,  the balanced  score card assessment
complements  the financial assessment  by providing  the qualitative  elements  which are missing  from the financial
indicators.  The balanced  score card brings to the table many non-financial  perspectives  which could peak the interest
of the enterprise.
Enterprises  can develop  very clear indicators  for IT business  performance  evaluations  by setting  up the key
performance  indicators  (KPI), which measure  the goal attainment  levels, and by utilizing  the management  by objective
system  (MBO), which sets the objective  levels of employee  skill development.
02 Financial  Performance  Evaluation  Technique
A) Overview  of financial  performance  evaluation
Financial  performance  evaluations  are done using financial  indicators,  the traditional  performance  evaluation  metrics.
They are also called “quantitative  performance  evaluations”  because  they use a common  unit called “currency”,  and
can evaluate  products  or services  with different  characteristics  in quantitative  terms.
+ The reason  why financial  performance  evaluations  are used is because  the shareholders  and managers  of companies
are more interested  in the financial results than in the specific  production  process  involved  in producing  the results;
and, with the financial  indicators,  it is easy to understand  the management  situation  in one glance.
+ Financial  indicators  have a strong result-oriented  nature and tend to ignore the process involved in attaining  the
results. For this reason, financial  indicators  are not great boosters  of employees’  motivation.
+ Because  financial  indicators  are abstract  accounting  figures, it is difficult  to accurately  convey  their meanings  to all
the members  of an organization.
B) Types of financial  performance  evaluation  techniques
Some of the most well-known  techniques  for evaluating  the financial performance  of an enterprise  include return
on investments  (ROI), net present  value (NPV), internal rate of retum (IRR), and payback  period (PP). These financial
performance  evaluations  can be used to evaluate  performance  for both a specific  period of time and a specific  point
in time.
