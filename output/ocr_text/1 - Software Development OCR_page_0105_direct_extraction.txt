C) Test design
@ Test design overview
The test design is used to check to what extent the target has been tested by identifying  and executing  test
cases. How to proceed  with the test design depends  on the testing  context,  such as the composition  of the
test organization,  the maturity  of the testing  and development  process,  time constraints,  and the number  of
participants  in the test. The test basis is analyzed  to identify  the test conditions,  and the test cases and test
data are designed  and specified  using the test design technique  based on the test conditions  identified  during
the test analysis  process.
@ Composition  of test cases
A test case is composed  of a set of input values, pre-conditions  when executing,  execution  procedures,
expected  results,  and conditions  after execution.  It is prepared  to check a specific  test condition.
<Table 29> Components  of a test case
Component Contents
Test case ID A number  or an identifier  used to identify  a test case.
Test case name A simple and clear description  of the test content.
Precondition Information  on the preconditions,  such as the environment  required  to run a test, or test data.
Test running  procedure A concrete  test running  procedure  composed  of up to 7 steps.
Expected  result A basis for deciding  whether  the test has been performed  as intended.
Result (pass/fail) The result of running  the test case.
Traceability Information  on requirements  related to the test case and applied techniques.
Importance The criteria for selecting  a test target  when time is limited.
Remarks Description  related of the intent and purpose  of creating  test cases.
