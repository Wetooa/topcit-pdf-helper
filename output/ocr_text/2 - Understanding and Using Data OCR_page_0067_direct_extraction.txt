Deletion  is not allowed  because  it is referenced  by the FK.
[Figure  27] Referential  integrity
© User-defined  integrity:  A specific  work rule, which does not fall into other integrity  categories,  is defined.
B) Key
© Super key: A sub-set  of all fields in a table. It is an attribute  or set of attributes  that can uniquely  identify  a record.
@ Candidate  key: A candidate  for the primary  key. It is a super key that satisfies  uniqueness  and minimality.  That is, if
any attribute  is removed  from a super key, the super key loses its nature and becomes  a candidate  key.
@ Primary  key: A unique identifier  selected  from among  candidate  keys to distinguish  a specific  record in the table. Like
the candidate  key, the primary  key has the attribute of  uniqueness  and minimality,  but a null value is not allowed. If
there are multiple  candidate  keys, a primary  key is selected  by considering  the following  two points.
+ Selecting  a field in which values  are not frequently  changed:  Each time the value of the field selected  as the primary
is changed,  it should be checked  whether  the value concerned  is a unique value or not. Therefore,  a column  without
frequent  change  is more suitable.
+ Selecting  a field in which values are not relatively  complex:  If a field selected  as a primary  key has a complex  data
domain,  the cost of comparing  the primary  key increases.  Therefore,  it is more suitable to select a domain with a
relatively  short and simple form.
@ Foreign key: When Table A refers to Table B, the foreign key of Table A refers to a key that can uniquely  identify  a
record of Table B. A foreign key consists  of one field or a subset  of all fields, and cannot  have duplicate  values or a null
value. Also, you must refer to a field that has a unique  value in Table B.
