Open innovation  can be divided into inward open innovation  and outward  open innovation.  In inward open innovation,
an enterprise  obtains know-how  or ideas from an outside  company,  research  center or university  during the course
of researching,  developing,  and commercializing  a specific item. In outward  open innovation,  a company  sends its
knowledge  or ideas to the outside  world in order to commercialize  them through  other business  models.  There are six
main forms of inward open innovation:  technology  purchase,  joint research,  sub-contracted  research,  establishment
of a joint venture,  venture  investment,  and acquisition.  As for outward  open innovation,  technology  sale and spin-off
are its two main forms.
With the rapid advances  made in IT technology, convergence  as a trend is gaining momentum  and the pace of
development  of new products  through  convergence  has become  much faster than before, making it difficult  for
companies  to keep up with the pace of market changes  simply by dint of their own R&D efforts. Open innovation
capability  as a means of strengthening  innovation  capability  in the face of structural  transformation of technology
and business  management  is expected  to have a huge impact  on the growth  of companies  in the coming  years,

@ Business  platform
A platform is a basic structure  commonly  used to produce  or sell various products.  Today, as competition  among
corporate  ecosystems  in the business  market intensifies,  the platform  is increasingly  being viewed as a key strategy
for securing  a competitive  edge using one’s enterprise  ecosystem.
This signifies that as goods and services  become  ever more complex  and the network  effects between  suppliers  and
consumers  increase,  the pattern of competition  is changing  from competition  between  companies  to competition
between  corporate  ecosystems.  The platform  is the foundation  for creating  and delivering  values to the participating
companies,  and its role as a medium  can determine  the fate of the enterprise  eco-system.  The main functions  of a
business  platform  are described  below.

The importance  of the platform  is clearly illustrated  by the examples  of Apple and Nokia. Although  Nokia entered  the
smartphone  market  earlier  than Apple, its platform  was edged out of the market  by competition  with Apple.
Symbian,  Nokia's operating  system, had a very complex  development  environment  because  it was geared for the
enterprise  market  and focused  on enterprise  application.  It failed to become  a standard  because  the entry barriers  to
developers  were too high. However,  in the case of Apple, it emphasized  the entertainment  functions  of the iOS and
built an online contents-centered  ecosystem  (App Store) which attracted  the participation  of numerous  developers.
In other words, the platform  became  a medium  that connected  and complemented  the values produced  by
