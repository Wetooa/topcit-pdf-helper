@ Strategy  selection
In the strategy  selection  phase, the best possible  direction  for the future of the company  is selected  based on the
information  collected  in the strategy  analysis phase. If the information  obtained  during the strategy  analysis  phase
is incomplete  or defective,  it becomes  impossible  to determine  whether  the strategy  chosen by an organization  is
the right one. Therefore,  strategy  selection  must begin with a thorough  review of the results and inferences  of the
preceding  strategy  analysis  phase.
If this process  is completed  seamlessly,  it will produce  an optional  list of alternatives  to a set of strategic  directions
that a company  can adopt. It is common  for each of these alternatives  to have different  resource  requirements  with
unique solutions  to key issues.
Each alternative  is evaluated  according  to a reasonably  established  evaluation  standard,  and, ultimately,  the most
appropriate  alternative  is chosen  as the strategic  direction.
© Strategy  implementation  and management
In the strategy implementation  and management  phase, the chosen strategic  alternative  is adopted  and put into
effect. During this phase, several managerial  issues could emerge, such as the viability  of a company’s  resources
for executing  a strategy,  the readiness  of a company’s  culture and structure,  the change management  for realizing
a strategy,  the path of strategy realization  and the development  method  decision,  the strategy implementation
readiness  of the steering  group within the company,  and the level of influence  over internal/external  stakeholders,  etc.
The progress  of the strategy  is monitored  continuously,  and the status of the strategy  is delivered  from the
implementation  phase to the analysis  phase via a feedback  path. The progress  of the strategy  may influence  the
internal  or external  environment  of the company.
In addition,  the internal or external  environment  may change due to the occurrence  of unexpected  events after
completion  of the strategy  analysis.  Therefore,  a review of the strategy  analysis  should be conducted  to ensure that
the chosen  strategic  direction  is still valid.
