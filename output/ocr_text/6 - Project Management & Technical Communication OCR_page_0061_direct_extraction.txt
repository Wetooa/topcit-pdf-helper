© How to write headings  (leading  message)
The heading  (leading  message) plays a very important  role in the preparation  of presentation  material.  This
is because  the key message  is determined  first and the materials that can further explain the message  are
placed at the bottom.  The key tips for writing  the heading  are as follows.
+ One message  per page: The heading  should contain  only one topic explaining  the rest of the contents  below.
More than one topic in a single heading  sentence  can be distracting.
+ It shouldn't  be too short to understand  what it’s about, and too long to read. It should be written in an
appropriate  length. The length of the heading  is usually one or two sentences.  More than two sentences
undermine  readability.
+The content  to be included  in the heading  is what to do (What) or why, summary  of the conclusion,
description  of key points, and the facts of information  or data.
+ Avoid ambiguous  content  that is not specific.  It is necessary  to reflect  specific  content  as much as possible.
© Use of charts
When preparing  a presentation,  it is important  to have a variety of charts to present  as the basis for your
argument.  Charts are a very important  element  in the presentation, as  the appropriate  form must be selected
according  to the characteristics  of the item to be displayed  to make the audience  understood  and convinced
of your argument.
