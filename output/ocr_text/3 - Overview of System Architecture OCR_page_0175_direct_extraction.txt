E) CIDR (Classless  Inter-Domain  Routing)
@® Concept  of CIDR
CIDR is a method  of combining  multiple  class C addresses  into a network.  It can reduce the size of the routing  table
and use IP addresses  in various  subnet  formats.
@ CIDR’s role
+ Provides  flexibility  in IP address  operation,  by allowing  users to  freely specify the range of network  identifiers
without  classifying  the IP addresses  for each A, B, and C class.
+ The network  address  can be set freely, preventing  wasted IP addresses  and enabling  effective  network  configuration.
+ It is an address  allocation  technique  that enables  the effective  management  of IP addresses  used for routing
between  domains.
@ CIDR expression
The subnet  part of an IP address  has an arbitrary  length with a format of a.b.c.d/x.  In the address  format, x refers to
the subnet  of the address.

F) Supernetting
@® Concept  of supernetting
Supernetting  is the opposite  concept  of subnetting,  referring  to the consolidation  of several small  networks  into one
large network.  It is an address  allocation  technique  that allocates  consecutive  class address  blocks to an organization
and enables  routing  from the outside,  as if it were one address  block [9].
@ Supemetting  method
+ Grouping  multiple  class C addresses  into a network
+ Use of part of the network  identifier  as the host identifier
+ The number  of consolidated  class C addresses  must be a power  of 2 and must consist  of sequential  addresses.
