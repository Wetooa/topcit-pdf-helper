04 Concept  and Search  Technique  of OLAP (Online  Analytical
Processing)
A) Concept  of OLAP
OLAP refers to the process  by which the end user accesses  multi-dimensional  information  without  an intermediary  or
medium,  and then analyzes  the information  interactively  and uses it for decision  making.  That is, when the operational
data extracted and converted  by ETL are stored in the data warehouse  or data mart, the end user analyzes  them
using OLAP.
B) OLAP search  technique
OLAP provides  various search techniques  that allow end users to analyze data from diverse perspectives  and
summary  levels. The table below shows the main search techniques  of OLAP.
<Table  64> Main OLP search techniques
Search  technique Description
+ Asearch  technique  that approaches  a specific  analysis  topic in phases  from a high summary  level to
Drill Down a low (detail) summary  level.
E.g. Time dimension:  Year > monthr  > day
* Concept  opposite  to Drill Down
+ Asearch  technique  that approaches  a specific  analysis  topic in phases  from a low summary  level to
pole a high summary  level.
E.g. Time dimension:  Day r > month r > year
Drill Across + Asearch  technique  that uses a certain analysis  viewpoint  on one analysis  topic to approach  another  analysis  topic.
Pivot + Asearch  technique  that changes  the axis of the analysis perspective  on a specific analysis  topic.
Slice + Asearch  technique  that creates subsets  by selecting  specific  values for the members  at one level or
the members  above  that level.
Dice + Asearch  technique  that creates subsets  by slicing more than two dimensions.
05 Concept  and Algorithm  of Data Mining
Data mining refers to a series of processes  that identify  a systematic  statistical  rule or pattern  among  a large amount
of data, convert  it into meaningful  information, and apply it to corporate  decision-making.  The table below shows the
major data mining algorithms.
<Table 65> Data mining  algorithms
Algorithm Description
+ An analysis  algorithm  that discovers  a pattern  using a combination  of highly relevant  data in
transaction  data, etc.
Association + Apriori algorithm,  etc.
+ This algorithm  is mainly used to place products  by analyzing  offline stores, and to recommend
related  products  automatically  at online shopping  malls, etc.
