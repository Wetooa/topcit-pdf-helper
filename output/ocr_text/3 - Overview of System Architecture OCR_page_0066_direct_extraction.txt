connect  them in order to deliver  the data.
@ Control  unit: A hardware  module that sequentially  generates  control signals to interpret  the program  codes
(instructions)  and run them.
@ ALU: A key element  of the CPU to execute  arithmetic  operations’  and logical operations?
Register:  A temporary  storage  area that temporarily  stores instructions  waiting  to be processed  by the CPU or the
intermediate result values of the CPU operation.  The register  types include, PC (program  counter),  IR (instruction
register),  AC (accumulator),  MAR (memory  address  register),  MBR (memory  buffer register),  and SP (stack pointer).
© Bus: A common  transmission  line that connects  the CPU, memory,  I/O unit, etc., in order to exchange  necessary  data.
Buses are classified  as follows:
+ Address  bus: A set of signal lines that transmits  address  data generated  by the CPU.
+ Data bus: A set of signal lines that transmits  data from the CPU to a memory  unit or an I/O unit.
+ Control  bus: A set of signal lines that are necessary  for the CPU to control  various  system  elements.

D) Instruction  cycle
This is the entire process  required  for the CPU to execute  an instruction.  The CPU repeats it from the moment  the
CPU starts executing  the program,  until the power is tumed off or an irrecoverable  error occurs to terminate  the
execution.  The instruction  cycle from the fetching  of the instruction  to the completion  of the operation  consists  of a
fetch cycle, an indirect  cycle, an execution  cycle, and an interrupt  cycle, as shown in [Figure 34].
2 Arithmetic  operation:  Addition,  subtraction,  multiplication,  and division
3 Logic operation:  AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.
