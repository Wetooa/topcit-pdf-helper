the new business  management  strategy  of Starbucks
Starbucks,  which opened  its first store in Seattle,  Washington  in 1971, is the
world's largest multinational  coffee shop and currently  operates  23,187
stores in 64 countries  around  the world. For example,  it has 12,973 stores in
the United States, 1,550 in Canada, 1,088 in Japan, and 544in Korea. A |
unique experience,  high-quality  coffee and beverages,  friendly  employees,
TM anda friendly  coffee shop interior  are just some of the differentiating
factors that set it apart from the rest of the competition,  and which have
propelled  the company  to its commanding  market  position.  However,  the economic  downturn  that began in
2008 also affected  Starbucks,  whose sales dropped  by more than 50 percent  by the end of 2008. However,
Starbucks  used this seemingly  disastrous  market  situation  as an opportunity  to transform  its business  by
integrating  wireless  technology  and the mobile digital platform into its business  process.  As part of this
endeavor,  the company  conducted  a customer  analysis  whose results indicated  that more than 1/3 of its
customers  were enthusiastic  users of smartphones.  This finding led the company  to introduce  a
smartphone  app-based  payment  technology  with which customers  could pay for their purchases  using |
their prepaid  cards or rechargeable  cards. It also created  the ‘Starbucks  Digital Network’  in partnership  with
Yahoo after noticing  that visitors  to its stores were regularly using its free WiFi service. This network,
through  its content  portal function,  provides  free Wall Street  Journal articles  for customers  to read and free
downloadable  tunes from iTunes for customers  to enjoy. Furthermore,  the company  internally  worked on
making its business  process  more efficient.  Now, Starbucks  baristas  no longer have to bend down when
making coffee, while the total time spent waiting  for the coffee to be made has been minimized  and the
time spent on making  drinks has been reduced.  To this end, the company  formed the Lean Team to advise
the company  on benchmarking  the lean manufacturing  method pioneered  by Toyota Motor Company.
What's more, the company  built a smart work environment  with wireless  technology  that maximizes  the
work efficiency  of its employees.  Within this smart work environment,  Starbucks  employees  can do their
work in any store across the nation. This has resulted in about 25% longer store visiting times by the
company’s  regional  managers.  Howard  Schultz,  the CEO of Starbucks  said, "Most of the cost savings  gained
come from new ways of operating  our stores and new customer  services’.  Successful changes  like this
have helped Starbucks  to recover  its profitability  and maintain  its growth.
