Content  of speech
For example, we think that an actor with good voice is good at acting. No matter how well you act, if you
cannot  speak well, you may be seen as if you are not good at acting. How to effectively  use body language  in
your presentation  is as follows.
@ Personal  Appearance  and Image
Your appearance  and image is also very important  factor to win the audience's  trust. In order to make a good
impression,  you need to have a neat appearance,  hairstyle,  and attire. It is difficult to make a good impression
and look trustworthy  when you look messy. And you should have a smiling  face. If you are gloomy  or stiff, you
may present  a negative  image.
@ Eye-contact
You must keep your eyes clear and bright. Insecure  eye gaze cannot make you look confident  or trustworthy.
Eye contact  is a very effective  way to make a presentation  successful.  When giving a presentation,  it is most
important  to make eye contact  with the key people who make decisions.  Look at one person at a time, but
distribute  your visual attention  about 60% to the decision  maker and 40% to the rest of the audience.  It is
necessary  to observe  the other person's  reaction  and develop  a connection  through  “eye contact’,
© Voice
You must explain with correct  pronunciation  and appropriate  speed, and presenting  with a resonant  voice helps
to enhance  delivery. Rather than keeping  the speed of voice constant,  you should immerse  the audience  by
controlling  the speed such as making  it slow, fast, or a pause, etc.
@ Use appropriate  motion
Body language  is effective  to use when emphasizing  important  points. If you take too much exaggerated
motion,  you can make a negative  impression.  It's a good idea to use the proper hand movements  at the right
timing.
© Use gestures  for emphasis
If you emphasize something  with your voice, and make a gesture  afterwards,  it may not be effective.  It is
effective  to make a gesture  at the same time or slightly  ahead of an utterance.  Make eye contact  and use your
hand gestures  together  while vocalizing  as if pressing  the voice slowly.
