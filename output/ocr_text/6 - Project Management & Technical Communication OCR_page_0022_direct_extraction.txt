Deductive  reasoning  is a method of deriving  a specific  fact from general premises  that are already known.
There is direct reasoning  that derives  one fact from one premise,  and indirect  reasoning  that derives  concrete
facts from two or more premises  (First premise,  Second premise).  The example  below is a representative  ex-
ample of deductive  indirect  reasoning.
All men are mortal. (First premise)
Socrates  is a man. (Second  premise)
Therefore,  Socrates  is mortal. (Conclusion)?
Inductive  reasoning  is a method  of reasoning  invented  by Francis Bacon in 1620. According  to Bacon, it refers
to a method  of making  guesses  or hypotheses  and principles  from empirical  facts and judging  truth/falsehood
with empirical  facts.* In other words, it is a method of deriving  a general principle  from several concrete  facts.
The example  below is a representative  example  of inductive  reasoning.
Socrates  is dead. (Concrete  fact)
Socrates  is a man.
Therefore,  a man is mortal. (General  principle)
Both deductive  and inductive  reasoning  are methods  of reasoning  for logical explanation,  but logical explana-
tion alone is not enough  to persuade  stakeholders.  In order to effectively  persuade  stakeholders,  there is more
to be needed  than logical explanation.
In some cases, it is necessary  to explain or verify an established  hypothesis  using a statistical  method,  and
the two mutually  exclusive  statements  used in this case are the null hypothesis  and the alternative  hypoth-
esis. The null hypothesis  is an initial argument  that is recognized  based on existing  knowledge, while the al-
ternative  hypothesis  is a new argument  that we hope to prove as a new truth through  testing. For example,
if there is an existing  claim that “the average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is 70 years old”, and there is a
claim that “the average  life expectancy  of men in Korea has recently  increased  to over 70 years”, we can con-
sider the following  null and alternative  hypotheses,
The Null Hypothesis:  The average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is 70 years old.
The Alternative  Hypothesis:  The average  life expectancy  of men in Korea is not 70 years old.
Based on the above two hypotheses, the  hypothesis  is adopted  or rejected  through  statistical  hypothesis
testing. In the example  above, if the null hypothesis  is rejected  and the alternative  hypothesis  is adopted,  the
average  life expectancy  is not 70 years old.
