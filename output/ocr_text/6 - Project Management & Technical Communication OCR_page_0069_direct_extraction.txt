As all projects  are original without being uniquely  the same, and the environment  in which they
are conducted  is all different,  project management  techniques  cannot be applied in a uniform
manner. Still, it is necessary  to know what standards  and guidance  exist in the project knowledge,
skills, techniques,  and tools, and which situation  they are applicable,  in order to make the project
successful.  Representative  knowledge  systems  and standards  of projects  are as follows:
PMP is a professional  qualification  for project management  supervised  by the PMI (Project
Management  Institute).  It has a project management  knowledge  system called PMBOK, consisting
of 5 process groups, 49 processes  and 10 knowledge  areas. PRINCE2  is a project management
method based on project management  qualifications  and procedures  created in the UK. ISO 21500
was developed  by the International  Organization  for Standardization  (ISO) in 2012, from the existing
private project management  into a global project management  standard  system, consisting  of 11
important  cases of project  management,  5 process  groups, 10 subject  groups,  and 39 processes.
