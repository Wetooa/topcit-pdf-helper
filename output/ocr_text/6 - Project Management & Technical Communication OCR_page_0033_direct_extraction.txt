ESSENCE
It should be written differently  for each target. In other words, you have to write the document  while imagining
how the viewer  might feel.
@ Write concisely  and clearly
People reading  documents  in a business  environment  don't have much time. Therefore,  documents  should be
written concisely  and clearly so that anyone can identify key points. A business  document  is different  from
an academic  or general document  in that it is necessary  to write the conclusion  first to grasp the rest of the
content  quickly.
@ Reflect  clear evidence
It should be prepared  based on accurate  information  and facts, and vague guesses  should be avoided.
Regulations,  policies,  and sources  of information  or data must be clearly  stated.
@ Logical  writing
The purpose,  background,  current situation,  cause, alternative,  etc. should be logically  structured  in terms of
why this document  is needed,  what is the cause, and how to do it.
03 Methods  of Writing  Business  Documents
A) Methods  of writing business  documents
The most used document  in a business  environment  is a one-page  report. If you can write a one-page  report
well, you will be able to apply it to various  documents  such as plans, business  plans, and proposals.  The princi-
ple of writing is the same. Focusing  on how to write a one-page  report, the method  of writing a specific busi-
ness document  is as follows.
@ Deliver  the key message  on the first page, and attach materials  for additional  explanation
Key opinions  are described  on the first page of the report, and other supplementary  explanations  or supporting
data are made as attached  documents.  Of course, the more data there are to support  the report, the better,
but those who receive the report or hold a meeting  do not have time to review the 20-30 pages of a lengthy
report. There is also an advantage  in that the time required  to complete  all 20-30 pages is drastically  reduced
by summarizing  the core content  on one page.
@ Write according  to the table of contents,  and itemize  sentences  focused  on keywords
First, create a table of contents  and then describe  the details. It might be too much to compress  all messages
into one page from the start. First, for the content  you want to explain,  create the table of contents  in order of
“1. Purpose,  2. Current  status/issue,  3. Direction  or improvement  plan, 4. Budget, 5. Decision-making,  etc.”, and
describe  the content  like brainstorming  ideas and summarize  it focused  on keywords.
When creating  a table of contents,  many beginners  often skip the contents.  The 5WIHIT  principle  below,
which is used  a lot for designing  a table of contents,  is a set of basic questions  to be asked when writing  most
reports.  If you write a report in a way to answer  those questions  and summarize  the report based on keywords,
you can create a report  with all the important  points.
