Overview  of System Architecture )
D) Types of files system  for each OS
Os File System
UNIX Boot block, super block, bitmap block, i-node, and data block
Linux File extension  system (ext, ext2, ext3, and ext4), ZFS, ResierFS,  and XFS
Solaris ZFS and UFS
Mac OS HFS and HFS+
Windows FAT, NTFS
E) UNIXi-node
In a UNIX system, inode has the role of allocation,  application,  creation,  link, and deleting  through  the file/directory
data.

inode Component Description
nore - Contains  all the data of a file or directory
- Owner  information,  access information,  file information,  link, and typ
inode table A file system  table that has all the inodes of files or directories
i number An entry number  of an inode registered  in the i-list

+ Ten direct data blocks (O~9): 96kb data
addressing + One single indirect  data block (10): 16MB
* One double indirect  data block (11): 32GB
+ One triple indirect  data block (12): 70TB
08 Input/ Output  System
The input/output  system includes  an input/output  device and the system’s  input/output  module (controller).
A physical input/output  device handles  the inputs and outputs  of data and between  the actual processor  and
the computer  user, and the input/output  module provides  the functions  of input/output  device control, timing
