Embedded  software  developers  should be able to select the chipset and the communication  method  to control
the chipset, and to check which development  tools are available,  and have a broad understanding  of the chipset  by
reviewing  the specification  of ZigBee  and Bluetooth.
In general,  the software  developer  should check the following  in the chipset  specification:
+ Block diagram:  Understanding  of the overall configuration  and flow of the chipset
* Communication  method:  Chipset  control  methods,  such as SPI, I2C, etc.
+ Memory:  RAM, ROM, and memory  size available  to developers,  address  methods,  etc.
+ GPIO: Port type and setting  method  for external  signal input and output  control
+ Development  tool: Tools necessary  to develop  with the chipset
According  to the application  field, the hardware  developer  reviews  the initial chipset  to develop  an embedded  product
and reviews  the entire circuit configuration  through  the chipset.  The hardware  developer  reviews  the chipset  in terms
of electrical  characteristics,  reliability,  complexity  in circuit configuration,  and chipset package  according  to device
design, and cost. The software  developer  reviews  if the chipset meets the standard,  whether  the control method  is
convenient,  whether  the existing  control method  can be reused,  whether  the memory  capacity  is adequate,  whether
the number  of ports for I/O control required  by the target product is sufficient,  whether  the chipset should be
separated,  and whether  it is preferable  to have multiple  functions  in a chipset.  The software  developer  should select
the optimal  chipset  after sufficient  consultation  with the hardware  developer.
