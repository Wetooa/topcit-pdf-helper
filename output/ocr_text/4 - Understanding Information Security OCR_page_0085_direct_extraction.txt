Managing  database  safely!
>>> Recent  trends and major issues
An amendment  to the Personal  Information  Protection  Act, which mandates  the encrypted  storage
of the resident  registration  number, passed the National  Assembly  plenary session on February
28, 2014. The content  of the amendment  is that the personal  information  handlers,  who keep the
resident  registration  number,  are obligated  to encrypt  the resident  registration  number  in order to
minimize  damage  if the personal  information  is leaked. Matters  concerning  the targets  of encryption
and application  timing of each target are determined  by Presidential  Decree, considering  the size
of the personal  information  processing  and the impact of leakage.  However,  its implementation  is
delayed, because  enormous  costs are required to encrypt  the social security  number, risk of failure,
and concern  about rapid performance  degradation  after encryption.  Recently,  there has been a spike
in interest  in database  encryption,  due to these trends and issues.
