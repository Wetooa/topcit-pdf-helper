03 High Availability  Storage
A) Redundant  array of independent  disks (RAID)  technology
Large-capacity  storage systems  generally  have an error controller  and backup  function  to safely store the massive
volume of data. RAID technology  is a storage  technology  that minimizes  the factors  that can cause failure, and it
improves  access performance  by arranging  a number  of disks, and by creating  a separate  disk unit by linking them
with each other
The main features  of RAID are improved  availability,  increased  capacity,  and increased  speed. Firstly, the improved
availability  feature provides  a hot-swap  function  to replace  a failed disk without  shutting  down the system, and it
recovers  the original data to the replaced  disk online. Secondly,  the increased  capacity  feature  organizes  several disks
into a large virtual disk, and it recognizes  them as large-capacity  storage  disks. Thirdly, the increased  speed improves
the overall data transfer  rate by partitioning  reading  and writing  data, and by transferring  it to multiple  disks in parallel.
RAID implementation  includes  RAID-O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-6,  and RAID-10  (1+0 or O+1)
are widely  used technologies,  while RAID-2,  RAID-3,  and RAID-4  are rarely used.
@ RAID-O  (Striped  disk array without  fault tolerance)
RAID-O  consists  of two or more drives and uses disk striping,  which stores data by dividing  it into pieces of a specific
size and saves it on multiple  disks at once. Although  it increases  the I/O speed, it cannot  protect  data because  there
is no redundancy.  A stripe, which means the size of the stored data, is a unit for dividing  data into pieces of a specific
size. RAID-O can reduce the I/O time by enabling  parallel processing  of I/O requests.  However,  data is lost if any drive
fails. Although  the technology  is not used much in business  environments,  RAID-10  uses it by taking its advantages
and overcoming  its disadvantages.
