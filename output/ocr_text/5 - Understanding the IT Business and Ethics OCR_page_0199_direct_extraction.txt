+ De-identification  Standards  for Identifiers:  As a rule, an identifier included  in datasets  should be deleted.  However,
an identifier  that is absolutely  needed  for a purpose  of the use of data can be utilized  after de-identification.
+ De-identification  Standards  for Attribute  Values: As a rule, an attribute  value included in datasets  should be
also removed  if it is irrelevant  to a purpose  of the use of data. Attribute  values like rare disease  or unique
professional  experiences  need strict de-identification  as they are highly likely to identify  an individual  under certain
circumstances.
