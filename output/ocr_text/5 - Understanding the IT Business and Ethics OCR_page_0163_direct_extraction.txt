Machine  learning  is the field of developing  algorithms  that machines  use for learning.  It could be defined as "science
and technology  of studying  systems  that autonomously  improve  their performance  using empirical  data gathered
through  interaction  with the environment."
Machine  learning  can be generally  divided into @ supervised  learning  @ unsupervised  leaming  @ semi-supervised

Regression  analysis  carries out the repeat process  of minimizing  the margin of error
between  given data and the estimated  values and models  the relationship  between  the
data.
Generates  a tree-shaped  decision  learning  model based on the properties  of the data
and derives  final decisions  on a given problem  through  iterations.
Algorithms  that mimic the structure  and function  of a living entity's  neural network
Consisting  of an input layer, an intermediate  connecting  layer, and result output  layer,
the artificial  neural network  updates  the weighted  value of the interconnecting  nodes in
each layer and outputs  the results.
An algorithm  that extends/applies  Bayes theorem  assuming  independence  between
characteristics  to solve clusters  and prediction  problems.
Using margin, support  vector  machine  defines  the object  function  of learning  to find the
best decision  boundary.
Clustering  is a method  of classifying  data by creating  clusters  that maximize  the
similarity  between  given data.
While identifying  the eigen structure  of the data is similar  to clustering,  the objective  of
dimensionality  reduction  is to summarize  or represent  data in a dimension  lower than
the original information.
Semi-supervised  learning,  supervised  learning  algorithm  are sometimes  combined  with
clustering  algorithm.  (See clustering  algorithm)
An iterative  algorithm  for finding  parameters  with maximum  possible  or maximum  post-
probability  in probability  models  that rely on unobserved  latent variables.
