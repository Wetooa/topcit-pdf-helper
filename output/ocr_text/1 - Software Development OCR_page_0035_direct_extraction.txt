C) Principle  of software  reuse
@ Generality: Software  should be generally  reusable,  rather  than designed  for a specific  area of application.
@ Modularity:  The principle  of information  hiding and abstraction.  Software  reuse should have the characteristics of
minimum  coupling  and maximum  cohesion.
@ Hardware  independence:  Reused software  should be independent  of execution  hardware  as much as possible.
@ Software  independence:  Reused  software  should be independent  of the OS or DBMS.
© Self-documentation:  The accurate  function,  usage, and interface  of the module  should be described.
© Commonality:  Reused  software  should be commonly  needed  and usable by many developers.
@ Reliability:  Reused  software  should be reliable  during  use.
D) Problems  when reusing  software  for practical  business
+ Itis difficult  to find software  modules  that can be used in common.
+ Software  is not very standardized.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the internal  interface  requirements  of the software  module.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the side effects  of the change.
+ The development  of software  components  for reuse can be more costly.
+ The benefits  of software  reuse may only be recognized  after a long time.
+ It is impractical  to extract  components  for reuse from existing  software  components.
E) Obstacles  to software  reuse and countermeasures
@ Obstacles  to software  reuse
+ Adverse  reaction  of managers  and developers.
+ Lack of motivation  to apply reuse technology.
+ Lack of software  standardization.
+ Social or legal obstacles.
