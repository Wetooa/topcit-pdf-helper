@ Client-server  architecture
The architecture  places system functions  in the servers and clients and configures  them to use the service,
depending  on the business  size or environment.  The server and client's role differs, depending  on where the
system functions,  such as data management,  business  processes,  and presentation,  are located. It can provide
the convenience  of a graphical  user interface  by running  the application  program  from the client side. However,  the
configuration  is complex,  and the development  and management  are difficult because  the architecture  is separated
into servers  and clients. Service  types include  games, chatting,  messenger,  FTP servers,  and terminal  servers.
