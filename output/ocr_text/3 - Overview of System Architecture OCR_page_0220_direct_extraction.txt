Overview  of System Architecture )
@ Background  of NFV
With the increase  in network speed and the emergence  of various services,  securing  space and power to
accommodate  the rapidly increasing  network  equipment  has become  a crucial issue for Internet  service providers.
Moreover,  the lifespan of network  equipment  is shortened,  making  it increasingly  difficult  to secure profits after
introducing  new equipment.  NFV was introduced  to solve these problems  through  virtualization  technology.
@ Concept  of NFV
NFV runs on a high-performance  x86 platform  and allows users to activate  the necessary  network  functions  as
needed.  It creates  a VM (Virtual Machine)  or service profile and implements  virtualization  on the network  by utilizing
the x86 capabilities,
@® NFV architecture  framework  structure
As shown in <Table 76>, the NFV architecture  framework  consists of  three function  groups: VNF group, NFV
infrastructure,  and management  and orchestration.
