02 Data Modeling  Procedure
A) Conceptual  modeling
+ The phase of abstractly  conceptualizing  and expressing  the information  structure  appearing  in the real world.
* Conceptual  modeling  begins with analyzing  and finding  the data requirements  of the organization  and user, and
includes  the process  of determining  which data are important  and the form of maintaining  that data.
+ Such data requirements  are used to describe  the phases to be performed  in subsequent  phases, to give shape to
the conceptual  data model, which is a set of low relevance,  and to discuss the initial requirements  with business
stakeholders.
+ Finding  the core entities and the relationships between  them is most important,  and the relationships should be
expressed  as an entity relationship  diagram.
+ The entity, entity identifier,  relationship  between  entities, number  and sequence  of corresponding  relationships,
entity properties,  etc. can be identified.
B) Logical  modeling
+ Logical modeling  is the key part of the data modeling  process,  which is a technique  or process  that clearly  expresses
the logical structure  and rules of business  information.
+ In this phase, the result of conceptual  design, which is created  for human understanding,  is converted  into a logical
structure  that can be easily stored in a database.
+ The phase in which normalization  is performed  to store data efficiently.
+ The relational  model is mainly used, and the deliverables  of conceptual  modeling  are converted  into the table
structure  drawing,  Table name, primary  key, foreign key, etc. are defined.
C) Physical  model
+ The phase that plans how to express  logical data modeling  in a computer  hardware  system  as a data repository.
+ The structure  of physical storage that is expressed  in tables and columns,  the storage  device to be used, and the
approach  used to extract  data are determined  in the physical  modeling  phase.
+ Performance  is one of the most important  factors to consider  in this phase, and a denormalization  review is
considered.
+ The data type, constraint,  and index of the column  are defined.
