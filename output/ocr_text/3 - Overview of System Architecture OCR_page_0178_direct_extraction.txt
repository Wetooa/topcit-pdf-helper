<Table 56) Prefix of IPv6 Address  Format
Format  prefix Description
0000 001 Reserved  for NSAP (Network  Service  Access  Point)
0000 010 Reserved  for IPX (Internetwork  Packet  Exchange)
001 Integrated  global unicast  address
11111110  10 Link-local  address
11111110  11 Site local address
W111 Multicast  address
The IPv6 addresses  are classified  into link-local,  unicast,  multicast,  and anycast  addresses,  according  to use. <Table
57> summarizes  the IPv6 address  notation.
{Table 57) IPv6 Address  Notation
Address  format Description
+ An address  that can only be used within the internal network
+ The address  can only be used within a network  and is used to identify  within that network  only.

Local addres SSy Fill with Os up to 64bit J
10bit Prefic EUI-64 ID
+ While the link-local  addresses  can only be used intemally,  the global unicast  addresses  can be used externally.

+ Delivers  packets  to all interfaces  that are registered  in the multicast  group.
+ FP is FF with 8 bits, followed  by a 4-bit flag, a 4-bit scope, and a 112-bit  group ID.
+ The upper 3 bits of the 4-bit flag are not used. If the last bit is 0, it means it is a well-known  multicast
address. If it is 1, it means it is a temporarily  used multicast  address.Multicast  address
+ It is similar  to a multicast  address,  in that it designates  multiple  interfaces,  but packets  are only
Anycast  address delivered  to the nearest  interfaces,  rather  than to all the hosts in the group.
+ It is expressed  as n-bit FP and 0 of (128-n)  bits.
B) IPv6 header  structure
<Table 58> describes  the IPv6's basic header  structure  and component.  IPv6 can have extended  headers,  in addition
to the basic header.
Version(4) Traffic class(8) Flow label(20)
Payload  length(16) Next header(8) Hop limit(8)
Source  address(128  bits)
Destination  address(128  bits)
