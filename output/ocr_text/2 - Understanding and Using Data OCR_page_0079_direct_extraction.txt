<Table 33> Denormalization  technique
Type ean Description
+ Table is merged  when it is more efficient  in improving  performance  because  there are many
join operations.
Merging  tables | + Merging  1:1 relationship  tables
+ Merging  1:M relationship  tables
Table + Merging  super/sub-type  relationship  tables
denormali- + Table is split when accessing  specific attributes  only in the table.
zation + When split, access frequency,  lockup, and contention  are reduced, but performance  is
Splitting  the degraded  because  the union operation  should be performed  when searching  the entire split
table table.
+ Vertical  split: When only specific  attributes  are frequently  accessed,  a table is created  by
splitting  the columns.
