@ Key storage  stage
Encryption  keys should be stored using the hardware  storage method,  such as a separate  key management
server or an HSM (Hard Security  Module), instead of hardcoding  the encryption  key into the application
program,  saving as a file in the file system,  or storing  the encryption  key inside the DBMS.
@ Key use stage
The database  administrator  and security  manager  should apply the principles  of “granting least privilege  and
separation  of duty”, and they should only allow authorized  persons  to access or modify  the master  key.
@® Key backup  and recovery  stage
Backup  and recovery  procedures  for the encryption  key should be prepared  to recover  it when lost or damaged,
and the encryption  key should be backed up periodically,  according  to the key backup policy.
© Key replacement  stage
The security  of the encryption  key should be maintained by  replacing  it periodically,  according  to the internal
policy of the organization.  Before replacing  the encryption  key, data should be decrypted  with the existing
encryption  key, and a new encryption  key should be created.  Then, the data should be encrypted  again.
@ Key destruction  stage
When the encryption  key is lost or damaged,  the data should be decrypted  using the encryption  key that has
been backed up by the administrator,  according  to the procedure  stipulated  by the organization  policy. A new
encryption  key should be generated,  and the data should be encrypted  with the generated  key again. Then,
the lost or damaged  encryption  key should be destroyed.
