Continuous  Integration  Server
A Cl server is required  to perform Cl (Continuous  Integration)  that can conduct  daily build, which requires at
least one accessible  source code repository,  as well as build script sets and build procedures,  and a test suite
for built artifacts.
C) Software  build
“Software  build’ refers to the process  of converting  source code files into independent  software  artifacts  that
can be executed  on a computer, or the results thereof. As one of the software  quality assurance  activities,
a daily build reduces integration  risks, prevents quality deterioration,  monitors  the progress  of initial fault
analysis, and boosts  the morale of developers.
D) Daily build and operation  test
+ The process  of comprehensively  compiling  software  products  again every day and running  a series of tests to
verify basic operation.
+ Daily build can simultaneously  increase  a project's  efficiency  and improve  customer  satisfaction,  primarily  by
reducing  such risks as software  integration  failure, poor quality, and low project  visibility,  and by saving time.
* The daily build and operation  test can be utilized for all projects,  including  large-size  projects,  small-size
projects,  off-the-shelf  software,  and business  systems.
E) Software  deployment
“Software  deployment’  refers to any act of creating  a software  system to be used, where the deployment
process  is composed  of interactions  together  with possible  transitions  between  them. These activities  can
take place either from the developers’  point of view or the consumers’  point of view. It is difficult  to define with
any exactitude  the deployment  procedures  for each activity  because  deployment  is unique to every software
system. Therefore,  “deployment”  should be understood  as a general procedure  that can be defined by the
specific requirements  or characteristics  of the customer  or user. Software  deployment  activities  include release,
installation  and activation,  deactivation,  uninstallation,  update,  built-in update,  version  tracking, and retirement.
