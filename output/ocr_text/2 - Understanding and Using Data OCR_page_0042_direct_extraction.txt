Database
>> Recent  trends and major issues
In the past, many databases  were built to create a “paperless”  environment  in which data recorded  on paper
are digitalized  and stored in a database.  Recently,  there have been many cases in which databases  have
been elaborately  built from a digital environment  to a digital environment.  Instead  of simply managing  data
with a fixed format  or length, there is an increasing  number  of cases in which data are stored and processed
as various  types of unstructured  data regardless  of the data format  or size.
