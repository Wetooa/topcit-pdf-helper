Currently,  the 3D printing technology is showing  limited performance  on several technological  fronts. But rapid
development  is expected  in the years to come because  of positive factors like the effort being put into developing
new technologies,  advancements  being made in new materials,  and critical patents  whose rights are scheduled  to
expire,
@ Wearable  device
The smartphone  market, which was on an explosive  growth  trajectory  since the introduction  of the iPhone in 2009,
is now in its maturing  stage. At this point in time, the next-generation  mobile  technology  that is expected  to replace
the smartphone  is the wearable  device. Wearable  devices are devices of various form factors that are designed  to
be attached  to the human body to improve  the convenience  of use. Wearable  devices are electronic  devices  that
are just worn on the body like an accessory,  but they are electronic  devices  that can communicate  with users from
the closest  location  to the user's body. They provide  functions  that are clearly differentiable  from existing  devices  in
terms of portability,  ease of use, and environmental  adaptability.  From fitness and well-being  to healthcare,  medical
care, manufacturing,  military,  and infotainment,  wearable  devices  are being used in increasing  number  of applications.
Wearable  devices began as an accessory  type device. But today, they are evolving into many different  forms,
including  body attachment  type which is attached  to the human body, apparel-integrated  type which is integrated
into textiles,  and body transplants,  which are devices  that are actually  inserted  into the human body,
The different  types of wearable  devices  are summarized  in the table below.

In recent  years, the growth of loT has greatly  expanded  the scope and the range of objects  (people,  objects,  devices,
etc.) that could be interconnected.  This development  has led to the growing  importance  of wearable  devices  because
such devices  are always connected  to the user’s network.  Because  they can free up the 2 hands of users and are
always located close to the user's view and the user's position,  the role of wearables  will become  increasingly  more
