+ Deep Learning
Deep learning  is the reason for the recent rapid development  of artificial intelligence.  Deep learning  is a branch of
machine  learning,  and a method  of solving  problems  similarly  to how humans  solve problems  using an artificial  neural
network  which performs  the transfer  and processing  of information  with multiple  nodes. This method is based on
human neural network  theory.
<Table 84> Characteristics  of Deep Learning
Characteristics Description
Pre-processing  for feature The two processes  that were separated  into the pre-processing  and feature  extraction  processes
extraction are consolidated  into the entire learning  process  as pre-processing  for feature extraction.
Automatic  extraction  of For data with large dimensions  and high complexity,  such as image data, there was a high
complex  data information possibility  of loss of information  in the preprocessing  process.
If the size of a high efficiency  simulation  is increased  for an abstraction  process  that summarizes
key content  or functions  in a large amount  of data or complex  data, the ability to absorb  large
amount  of data is improved.Efficient  for high level
abstractions

@ Use of Big Data
"Flu Trends" is a quintessential  Big Data service that was launched  by Google  for the general public. In 2008, Google
hit upon the idea that people search for cold or flu on the Internet if they suspect  that they have the flu. The
company  released  a service that predicts  cold and flu trends by analyzing  the search information  and the location  of
the people searching  with keywords  like “flu” and “cold”. Credit card companies  are another  group that rely big time
on Big Data. They analyze consumption  and behavioral  data of their customers  and use it for marketing,  product
development,  and product  recommendation.
Big Data refers to data that is so large that it is difficult  to handle them with traditional  data storage,  management,
and analysis  methods;  they are data whose size has exceeded  the limits of what could be managed  as a general
database.  Big Data is difficult to quantify  through  conventional  methods  because  the 3Vs of volume, variety, and
velocity  are all large, and also include unstructured  or non-metrical  variables,  making it difficult  to analyze population
trends  or characteristics  through  statistical  analysis.  Big Data is often represented  using visualization  tools.
<Table85>Characteristics  of Big Data
Category Characteristics
+ Data greater  than peta byte
Data size + Millions  and billions  of users
+ Trillions  and tens of billions of data records
+ Unstructured,  non-formal  data
Data structure + Large volume  of distributed  data
+ Simple data correlation  with plain schema  structure
+ Many data that are related to time
Type of data + Mission Critical  data
+ Example)system/event  logs, sensor  data, SNS data, web mining  data, etc.
