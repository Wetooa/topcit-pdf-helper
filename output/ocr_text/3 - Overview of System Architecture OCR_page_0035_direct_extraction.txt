[Figure 11] shows user a connecting  to a webserver  (my.server.com)  and searching  for the data. <Table 1>
describes,  in detail, which changes  occur in the network  at each stage of the operation  in [Figure 11]. The
standard  protocol  used at each stage is described in parentheses,  and its concept  and detailed  operation
are described  in the following  chapters.
This example  shows how a simple network  service,  as shown in [Figure 11], is executed.

{Table 1) Web Use Scenario  by User A
User A enters http://my.servercom/  on the web browser  and presses  the Enter key.
Siy))) The web browser  intends to send User A’s request  to the webserver,
my.server.com,  but cannot do it because  my.server.com  is an arbitrary
domain name for users to recognize  easily. The web browser  requests
the IP address  of my.server.com  to the domain name server to solve the
problem  (ONS).
On receiving  the IP address  of my.servercom,  220.17.23.15,  from the DNS, the web
browser  connects  to the webserver  using the address  and requests  data in the
document  route (HTTP).
{ Step  3-1 | The web browser hands over the requested  information  to the TCP protocol
to request  my.server.com.  The information  is properly  capsulized  and delivered
to the webserver  program  of my.servercom  (TCP).
(step  3-2, a2 } Information  created by the TCP protocol is capsulized  to be routed to the

networks,  The IPv4 address  of user A’s computer  is 192.168.11.5  and cannot  be
transmitted  to my.server.com  directly.  It must be transmitted  to the computer's
gateway  wired/wireless  router B (192.168.11.1).  However,  an IP address  cannot
be used for data transfer  within a network, so the MAC address  is needed for
this.  After finding  the MAC address  corresponding  to 192.168.11.1,  the gateway’s
IP address,  through  network  broadcasting,  the packet is transmitted  to wired/
wireless  router  B (ARP, Ethernet,  private network,  and NAT).
