B) Principles  and main contents  of requirements  specification
The IEEE (Institute  of Electrical  and Electronics  Engineers)  explains  the content  and quality of the
recommended  software  requirem ents specification  and provides  overview  samples  of various requirements.
The specification  principle  can use the requirements  shown below as the criteria  for quality  checks.
<Table 37> Requirements  specification  principles
Principle Description
Verifiability + The requirements  specification  should be verifiable
Modifiability + The requirements  specification  should be modifiable.
Clarity + The requirements  specification  should be presented  to each stakeholder.
Accuracy + The requirements  specification  should be accurately  described.
Traceability + The source and principle  of the requirements  specification  should be traceable.
Consistency + There should be no conflicts  between  the requirements.
+ All important  details, such as functionality,  performance,  and constraints,  should beSe  ees documented.
Interpretability + Requirements:  Should provide consistency  of interpretation.
Understandability + The requirements  specification  should be easy for the stakeholders  to understand.
The table below describes  the main contents  of the requirements  specification  defined as a standard  by the
IEEE. It can be referred  to as the contents  and details  when creating  a requirements  specification.
