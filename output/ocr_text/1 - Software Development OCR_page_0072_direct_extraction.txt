02 Object-Oriented  Design  and Principles
Requirements  analysis  is performed  by creating  from a class diagram and a sequence  diagram to an activity
diagram  during the process  of object-oriented  analysis.  In general, requirements  analysis  is described  at the
conceptual  level from the customer's  viewpoint,  while the physical aspect of how it should be stored is not
described.
Emphasis  is placed on how to represent  the user requirements  - previously  identified  during the object-oriented
analysis  process - in the software  in the object-oriented  design phase. Details about implementation  are
suggested  in the design phase to determine  a specific method of physically  realizing  the requirements.  Object-
oriented  design has the advantage  of enabling  design without  the need for a large-scale  conversion  process by
reusing  the notation  used in object-oriented  analysis.
A) Object  and class
A class is a collection  of similar objects.  An object represents  a thing that exists independently in the real
world, for example,  Mr. Kim Cheolsu  (example  of an employee)  or Seoul (example  of a place). Each object is
described  by a group of specific properties  and is distinguished  from other objects by property  values. For
example,  Kim Cheolsu  has such properties  and property  values as his social security  number  “830425-1XXXXXX”
and his date of birth “April 25, 1983”.
There are sets within a given system that naturally  have similar properties.  For example,  there are many
students  in a college, and these students  have similar information.  They share the same properties  (e.g.
student number, major, grade, etc.), and each student  (object) has a unique value for each property.  At this
time, a set of objects having the same property  is called a class. That is, an instance  of a class is an object.
For example,  “Kim Cheolsu”  and “Lee Younghee’,  as objects  that belong to the student  class, share the same
properties  (student  number, major, grade), but “Kim Cheolsu”  has unique property  values such as his student
number  “925462”,  his major “CS”, and his grade “3.8”, while “Younghee  Lee” also has his own unique property
values, such as his student  number  “956234”,  major “Mathematics”,  and grade “4.2”.
When investigating  the characteristics  of data required by the system, it is more convenient  to describe  a
grouped  class than it is each object. The task of grouping  similar  objects  is called classification,  and the objects
grouped  through  classification  share the same types of properties,  constraints,  and behaviors.
B) Encapsulation
The goal of design is to create software  that is easy to understand  and modify: and in this regard designing
modules  with a high level of independence  is a starting  point. Software  looks mature when the constituent
elements  perform their respective  functions  independently.  The functional  independence  of software
components  is a byproduct  of the modularization  process and the aforementioned  concept  of information
hiding. The functional  independence  of a module  can be maximized  when the unit modules  are processed  more
completely  and when the processing  dependency  with other modules  is minimized.
Encapsulation,  one of the important  concepts  of the object-oriented  development  method,  is both a method
of obtaining  improved  abstraction  and independence  through information  hiding, and a method of protecting
properties  and operations  together  as a group. Object-oriented  languages  have a function  that supports
encapsulation.
