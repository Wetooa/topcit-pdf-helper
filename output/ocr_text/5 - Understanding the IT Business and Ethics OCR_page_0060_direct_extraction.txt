advantages  and disadvantages.  IT business  used to be adopted  using either one of the methods, but these days
companies  frequently  opt for a hybrid approach  to adoption.

04 IT Business  Outsourcing  Service
A) Overview  of IT business  outsourcing
A company  can turn to several strategies when it has to respond quickly to changing  internal and external
environments.  For operational  areas and processes  where a company  is certain that it holds a competitive  edge, it
will try to improve  and develop  further  in order to strengthen  its competitive  advantage.
For non-strategic  areas or processes  where it is weak, however,  a company  may turn to excellent  outside  resources.
For this reason, a company  may seek to perform  important  activities  (or those value chain activities  where it enjoys
competitive  advantages)  in-house,  whereas  for non-strategic  areas and areas where it is weak, it will subcontract  out
the work to outside  experts  or third-party  companies.  This is what is meant  by “outsourcing”  and, to be more exact, ‘IT
business  outsourcing”  when IT resources  are involved.
In IT business  outsourcing,  companies  outsource  IT resources,  IT management,  and IT operations  and usually focus
on their core operational  areas, thus enabling  them to retain their competitive  advantages.
