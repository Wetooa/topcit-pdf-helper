Presentation  is a series of processes  in which the presenter  induces  changes  in the audience's  consciousness
or behavior  in the direction  the presenter  desires  by conveying  and persuading  the audience  with certain facts,
information,  and opinions  within a set time period to achieve  the desired  goal.

B) Presentation  process
@® Goal/topic  setting
Goals and topics should be defined  in one sentence  to make them clear. If the goal is unclear, the presentation
is more likely to fail.
@ 3P analysis
Person (audience),  Purpose  (purpose),  and Place (place/environment)  are called 3P. The presentation  needs to
be analyzed  by comprehensively  considering  the audience's  situation  (time, interest,  etc.), the purpose/goal  of
the presentation,  and the place and environment  of presentation.
@® Content  composition/design
It's the step in determining  the theme of what to tell to achieve the desired goal. It is important  to write
sentences  in a narrative  manner  like brainstorming,  and to make a compelling  message  by appropriately
trimming  it.
@ Data collection/analysis
Collect  and cite data that can effectively  support  the previously  constructed  message.
© Delivery  format
Prepare  data in a format  that can effectively  deliver a message  to the other party based on the items analyzed
by 3P analysis
© Rehearsal
It is a stage of rehearsal  practice based on the written data. It takes a lot of practice  to avoid being nervous  in
practice.
