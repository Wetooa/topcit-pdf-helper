B) Professional  Ethics of IT Business
@ Professional  Ethics of IT Business  Workers
Professional  ethics can be divided into two. One is general  ethics required  of any professional,  and the other is special
ethics of a specific  profession.
IT business  is developing  rapidly as various  technologies  compete  with each other and form a huge ecosystem,  and
are directly  affecting  the quality of life of everyone  throughout  the world. However,  safety  accidents,  information
security  accidents,  and cyber-crimes  frequently  appear  due to the lack of professional  ethics of ICT industry  workers
and software  developers.  As the negative  impact of such accidents  expands  and social losses increase,  the need and
importance  of professional  ethics of IT business  workers  is being emphasized.
There is no global standard  of professional  ethics encompassing  the entire IT business.  However,  you can look up
the norms that are considered  important  in IT business  in the internal code of conduct  of individual  professional
organizations  or companies.
Examples  are the ACM (Association  for Computing  Machinery)  Code of Ethics and Professional  Conduct, IEEE-
CS(Institute  of Electrical  and Electronics  Engineers  - Computer  Science)Software  Engineering Code, and
NSPE(National  Society  of Professional  Engineers)  Code of Ethics for Engineers.
Codes of ethics commonly  found in these codes are required  more as the intelligent  information  society's  dependence
on IT technology  increases.  They include moral responsibility  for public safety and the implementation  of technology
