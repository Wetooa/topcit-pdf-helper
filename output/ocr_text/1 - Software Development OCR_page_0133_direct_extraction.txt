[Figure  27] Obligations  of the open-source  software  license
B) Comparison  of open-source  software  licenses
Open-source  software  licenses  have common  characteristics  such as free use, distribution  without  restrictions,
source code acquisition,  and source code modification.  However,  there are some differences  with each
license regarding  the obligation  to disclose  secondary  works again, and the combination  of open source with
proprietary  software.
The GPL is the most stringent  license,  which specifies  the condition  that combining  GPL code with proprietary
software  is not allowed. When a program is distributed  under the GPL, which combines  proprietary software
code and the GPL code, the proprietary  software  code must also be opened.
@ GPL (GNU General  Public License)  2.0
GPL 2.0 is the license most frequently  adopted  for open-source  software.  It was created  and distributed  by the
Free Software  Foundation  (FSF) and is very strict compared  to other open-source  software  licenses. The main
matters  to be observed  are as follows.
+ When distributing  software, the distributor  should specify the copyright  notice, distribution  under the GPL,
and the absence  of warranty  liability  for GPL software.
+ When modifying  software  or linking new software  (both static and dynamic  linking),  the source code must be
opened  in accordance  with the GPL.
+ When distributing  its own patented  program,  a distributor  cannot receive royalties  from users who use the
program  under the GPL.
@ GPL (GNU General  Public License)  3.0
The basic contents  of GPL 3.0 are similar to those of GPL 2.0, but it has been supplemented  with matters
related to DRM (Digital Rights Management,  technology  and service to protect copyrights),  software  patent
issues, and compatibility  issues. The main matters  to comply  with are as follows.
