G) IPv4 address  allocation
@ DHCP (Dynamic  Host Configuration  Protocol)
DHCP is a protocol  that provides  a method of dynamically  allocating  IP addresses,  and other related configuration
details,  to DHCP-enabled  clients on a network,  using a DHCP server.
The DHCP server can assign a default gateway,  a DNS server address, a local router, a lease period, and a domain
name as DHCP options, in addition  to the IP address  and subnet  mask.
The IPv4 DHCP lease process  is established  through  the exchange  of four UDP messages.  The four UDP messages
are DHCPDISCOVER,  DHCPOFFER,  DHCPREQUEST,  and DHCPACK.  <Table 54> lists the details.
{Table 54) DHCP Message  [10]
Message Description
DHCPDISCOVER The IP address,  sent by a client, has the address  value of 255.255.255.255.
DHCPOFFER The DHCP server  delivers information,  such as the IP address,  subnet mask, default  gateway,  and lease period.
The client sends DHCPREQUEST  to the server, and the message  includes  that the client has selected
the lease information.
DHCPACK The DHCP server  sends the DHCPACK  message  to the client to allow the use of the IP address.DHCPREQUEST
@NAT  (Network  Address  Translation)
NAT is a function  that interconnects  terminals  on a private network  to communicate  with public networks, such as
the Internet.  It is defined  in RFC 3022 and RFC 2663.
The purpose  of using NAT is to hide internal IPs to defend them from outside attacks  while solving insufficient  IP
addresses. NAPT (Network  Address  Port Translation)  is an extension  of the basic NAT and converts  the packet's
source  port number.  The reason for using NAPT is to connect  to multiple internal hosts with an IP address.  NAPT can
theoretically  process  communication  with up to 65,535 internal  hosts with an official IP address.
