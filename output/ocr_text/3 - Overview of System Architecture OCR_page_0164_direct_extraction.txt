[Figure 118] Network  Packet  Structure  [5]
In [Figure 118] above, “Version”  refers to the protocol  version  of the datagram,  “IHL” refers to the header  length, and
“Type of Service” refers to which type of service the host wants in the subnet. “Total length” refers to the sum of
the header and data lengths in the datagram,  “Time to Live” refers to the packet life limit, and “Protocol’ refers to
the notification  of TCP or UDP for the recombination  of the datagram  on the network  layer. “Source  Address”  and
“Destination  Address’  refer to the source and destination  addresses  of the 32-bit datagram.
03 Packet  Switching  and Network  Layer Protocol/Instruction
A) Packet  switching
The methods  of finding the packet path in a packet-exchanging  network,  include the datagram  approach  and the
virtual circuit approach.  The datagram  approach  is a non-connected  service  that independently  processes  all packets.
Packets  can be transferred  through  different  paths, and the packet’s  destination  address  determines  the forwarding
path. The virtual circuit approach  is a connection-oriented  service. It establishes  a virtual path for the datagram
before the transfer,  and all datagrams  are transmitted  to the same path after the connection.  The forwarding  path is
determined  by the packet  label (virtual circuit identifier).
B) Network  layer protocol/command
The network  layer protocols that convert  the IP and MAC addressesinto  an IP address,  are the ARP (Address
Resolution  Protocol)  and the RARP (Reverse  Address  Resolution  Protocol).  ICMP (Internet  Control Message  Protocol)
is a protocol  used to transfer  the network  error information, and IGMP (Internet  Group Management  Protocol)  is the
protocol  for IP multicast  transfer.
