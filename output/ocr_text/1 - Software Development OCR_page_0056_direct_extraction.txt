changes  can be limited to the data structure inside the module and the actions needed to access it, so that
users can easily adapt themselves  to the change  and perform  maintenance.
C) ) Stepwise  refinement
Stepwise  refinement  is realized by gradually  moving from the program  structure  to the module details. The
level of abstraction  decreases  during the refining process, and each function is decomposed  to present  a
solution.  Refinement  is a process  that requires  many efforts and enables  system implementation  by allowing  a
detailed  description.
Design is the stepwise  refinement  process  of moving  from a high abstraction  level to a low abstraction  level.
The flow of engineering,  ranging  from problem  description  to requirements  analysis,  design and programming,
can also be regarded  as a stepwise  refinement  process.  Another  example  of stepwise  refinement is one in
which a system is started as a big process  and gradually  subdivided  into small processes  that perform  detailed
functions,  using the structural  analysis  method.
D) Modularization
In most cases, engineering  approaches  a system by dividing  it into components.  The component  of software  is
a module.  When expressed  in a programming  language,  software  modules  are called subroutines,  procedures,  or
functions.  Generally,  a system is subdivided  into functions  using a top-down  approach  when modularizing  the
system.  In this case, a control layer appears  between  the modules.
In addition,  modularization  enables  us to manage  systems  intelligently  and to solve the problem  of complexity.
In other words, problems  are divided (according  to the aforementioned  principle  of “Divide and Conquer’)  into
smaller units (modules) to solve a large and complex  problem.  Modularization  makes system maintenance
and modification  easier. However,  if the number  of modules  increases,  the size of each module decreases
proportionately,  system performance  deteriorates,  and overload  occurs due to an increase  in mutual exchange
between  modules.  Therefore,  how to minimize  the interference  between  modules  by role and then play the role
effectively  by focusing  on the purpose  becomes  the important  criterion  for module  evaluation.
E) Structuralization
Software  systems  can be structuralized  by the division process,  which is related to the principle  of divide and
conquest  explained  earlier. Division is performed  first during the requirements analysis process,  and detailed
division  occurs in the design phase.
Analysts  have the mission of finding and dividing  important  system elements  or functions,  whereas  designers
have the mission of structuralizing  the results of analysis.  How to divide a system is not a simple matter, and
there are no complete  guidelines  for this. However,  we can make use of experience and the guidelines for
existing  systems  by understanding  the characteristics  of the system.
Several structural  frames can be found from existing  systems  depending  on the characteristics  of the system.
The amount  of time and effort expended  can be reduced  when making  a system with similar characteristics  by
using such frames.
