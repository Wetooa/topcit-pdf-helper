+ Preview  for practical  business The necessity  of software  testing  and
the reality of enterprises
In March 2005, bus companies  lost KRW 500 million won per day in free rides caused by faults or
failures  of T-Money  bus terminal  software.
In October  2007, Toyota Motors  paid with an operator  USD 1.6 billion in compensation  due to the
sudden  unintended  acceleration  of the “Camry”  model’s  ECM firmware  fault.
In August 2009, the launch of “Naro”, Korea’s  first space launch vehicle,  was delayed  due to a
software  fault in the automatic  launch device software  related  to pressure  measurement.
The abovementioned  incidents  are widely publicized  cases of software  faults. Software is ubiquitous
and directly related to the existence  of companies  and the daily life of countless  individuals.  The
most obvious  question  that springs to mind is why such faults even occur when software  is so
important.  Everyone  thinks they know software  testing well. However,  when software  testing is
actually  performed,  it is not performed  as well as expected due to various problems.  Currently,
enterprises  are facing many problems  due to the irrationality  of the contract  itself, frequent  changes
to the requirements  and the unreasonable  demands  of customers,  the limitations  of support at
the organizational  level, impractical  procedures  and paperwork,  numerous  cases of reporting  and
meetings,  and reports on such reporting  and meetings.  More specifically,  enterprises  have difficulty  in
running  software  testing  due to the following  reasons.
+ It is a well-known  fact that anywhere  from 40% to 60% or more of the total development  cost is
spent on software  testing, as testing  is very important.  However,  the reality is that those involved
in software  development  are unable to pay sufficient  attention  to testing because  it is difficult  to
perform  their own fixed tasks only, and that few developers  are actively  interested  in any testing
other than unit testing.
+ As development  itself is conducted  with insufficient  personnel  and resources  for a period shorter
than the actual schedule,  it is not easy to consider  investing  in testing.
+ Testers  who perform  testing  tasks sometimes  know too little about testing.
+ Testing  is performed  without  an accurate  understanding  of the testing  techniques.
+ Decision  makers or managers  do not fully recognize  the importance  of testing. Even though test
engineers  with a sense of mission  try to run testing properly,  executives  sometimes  force them to
stop testing  without  understanding  its importance.

The reality is that the service operation  team and the development  team also perform  testing  tasks
internally  in companies,  except for conglomerates.  While the number  of people remains limited, the
number  of channels  and workloads  is increasing  continuously  and the test period is being shortened,
resulting  in the release  of incomplete  services  and, consequently,  higher maintenance  costs.
