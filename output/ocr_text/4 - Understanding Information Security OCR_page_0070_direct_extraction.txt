B) OWASP  TOP 10
The OWASP  Top 10 - 2017 is primarily  based on over 40 sets of data submitted  by companies  specializing  in
application  security,  and on the survey on more than 500 persons  in the industry.  The data encompasses  the
vulnerabilities  collected  from hundreds  of organizations  as well as more than 100,000  real-world  applications
and APIs. The Top 10 items are selected  and ranked, according  to the prevalent  data, which is compensated
with the estimated  value of the possibility,  detectability, and level of impact  of the attack.
[Figure 33] shows the OWASP  2017 version,  compared  to the previous  version in 2013.
