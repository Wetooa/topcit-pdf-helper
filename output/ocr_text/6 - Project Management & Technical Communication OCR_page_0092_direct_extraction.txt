Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )

One of the characteristics  of the project is that “it has the beginning  and the end’, which means
that “there is a fixed timeline”  or “a delivery  date’. In other words, as time precisely  heads toward  the
delivery  date, it is necessary  not only to work efficiently  work in the project execution  process, but
also to minimize  errors or unnecessary  work.
Nevertheless,  there are cases in which the delivery  date of the project is delayed,  resulting  in a
“project  failure”.
Accordingly,  an approach  to systematically  manage  the schedule  is being adopted, and one is to
break down the project schedule  into smaller  units and repeat them to fulfill the schedule.  In other
words, you adjust the schedule  according  to the situation  while estimating  the future schedule
based on the tasks already  completed.  This concept  is nothing  new but has become  more necessary
as market  competition  intensifies  or technical  development  diversifies.
One example  is the Agile Process,  which is based on rapid and iterative  development  through
XP (eXtreme  Programming)  or Scrum. In other words, a short schedule  of developing  part of  the
whole is called a “sprint”, and these sprints are performed  several times to increase  the degree of
completion.  At the end of the sprint, there is a procedure  called “retrospective”  to allow participants
to communicate  in a free atmosphere  and to realistically  adjust future plans.
