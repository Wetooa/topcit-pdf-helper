Information  system infrastructure  is generally  implemented  by separately  purchasing  servers, storage, and network
devices  from each vendor, then integrating  them for the project. Moreover,  they also separately  purchase  software,
thus they need to test and verify if it works properly  with the hardware.  However,  such a complex  structure  and
procedure  inevitably  have led to inefficiency  from the implementation  time and system management  aspect.
The converged  infrastructure  is a concept  introduced  to solve the problem.  It integrates  the hardware,  like storage,
server, and network,  with the virtualization  solution and the management  software,  supplied  by each vendor, into a
product  and validates  it in advance  for supply  to customers  (see [Figure  87]).

However,  despite the advantage  that the converged  infrastructure  enabled  quick service implementation,  through
the integration and validation  in advance,  it was not actually  well received  in the market,due  to its poor performance
compared  to input resources.  Since the product  integrates  the server, the network,  and the external  storage,  the cost
was exceptionally  high, and the system had a problem  with scalability.  In particular,  the high-performance  external
storage  was a severe burden from the cost and structural  aspect.
The hyper converged  infrastructure  (HCI) is a concept  that overcomes  the limitations  of Cl by eliminating  the
