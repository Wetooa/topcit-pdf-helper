B) Principles  and methods  of official letters
The document  conveyed  to clearly express  the intent of an organization  in business  settings,  in the name
of the head of the organization,  is called the official letter and it’s officially  called the draft/execution  text. A
draft text is a document  created  to receive approval  from the  head of the organization.  It is preserved  after
the approval,  and then the approval  section is deleted  to create an execution  text and deliver  to the receiving
organization.  Here, we will look at the principles  and methods  necessary  for writing  official letters.
@ Approval
This document  becomes  effective  with the signature of the approving  authority.  Signatures  include electronic
image signatures,  electronic  text signatures,  and administrative  electronic  signatures.
Approval  refers to the act of a person who has the correct  authority  to decide his or her decision,  and the types include
regular  approval,  discretionary  approval,  substitute  approval,  and cooperation.
+ Regular  approval:  Approval  made by the head of the organization.  For example,  approval  by the head of an
institution  or the CEO of a company
+ Discretionary  approval:  Refers to the fact that the head of the organization  has delegated  the approval
authority  to the leader  of the sub-organization  according  to the delegation  regulation.  In the case of approval
made through  proper  delegation,  it has the same effect as regular  approval.
+ Substitute  approval:  Refers to a case where the approver  temporarily  delegates  the approval  authority  to a
subordinate  member  when the person is absent  for an extended  period of time.
