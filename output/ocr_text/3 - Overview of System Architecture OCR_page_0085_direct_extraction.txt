B) Connection  of storage  unit and server
Multimedia  services,  using a large volume of data, led to computer  systems  storing an increased  volume of data. A
large-capacity  storage  system is necessary,  since a single disk cannot  support  the increasing  data capacity.  A storage
system logically  groups multiple  disks in order to store large capacity  data that a single disk cannot handle. It is
classified  into DAS, NAS, and SAN, depending  on how it is connected  to the computer.
@ Direct attached  storage  (DAS)
The storage  connects  a computer  system with disks directly  through  a fiber channel  or SCSI cable in order to utilize
the storage  capacity.  It allows the computer  system to manage  the file system directory.  Since the storage is
directly  connected  to the computer  system, it works like an external hard disk at high speed. Its advantage  is that
its configuration  is simple, and the cost is low without  a separate  switch, but there is a limitation  in the number  of
disks that can be connected.  Moreover,  files in the storage  cannot  be shared with other computers,  since it is directly
connected  to a computer.

@ Network  attached  storage  (NAS)
The storage has a separate  file system management  server (controller)  to manage  the storage  media such as HDD
and SSD. It is connected  to a computer  system  through  an Ethernet  network  interface  like LAN or WAN. Since it has
a separate  file system management  server, it is easier to manage  data, and multiple  servers  can share the storage.
Moreover,  multiple computer  systems  on the same network  can use the storage,  regardless  of the physical  location.
As the storage  is connected  over a network,  its speed and capacity  are limited by the network  speed.
