+ Preview  for practical  business Pl Case Study: Korea Workers’  Compensation
& Welfare  Service  opens a new era
From 2010 to 2011, the Korea Workers  Compensation  & Welfare Service  (COMWEL)  built an advanced
administration  system through  a wide-scale  process  innovation  (Pl) project. Process  innovation  (Pl) cannot
be realized  simply by setting  up a system or with training  alone. It can only be successful  when there is a
company-wide  consensus  from the top management  level to the working-level  staff of the organization,
and when the best practices  are applied to the organization  process  and fully internalized.  For this reason,
it is very difficult  for conservative  public institutions  to implement  project innovations.  However,  with
COMWEL’s  systematic  project management  and utilization,  it has so successfully  implemented  process
innovation  that it has become  a benchmark  for other institutions  to follow.
COMWEL  pursued process  innovation  under the banner of ‘job efficiencies  through process innovation’
because  it wanted to improve  the quality of its public services  despite having limited human resources.
It began the task of increasing  job efficiency  with internal discussions  over those areas most in need of
improvement.  Starting  with AS-IS process  diagnosis  consulting,  COMWEL  next studied the end-to-end
process  of each job, and then selected  the processes  requiring  process innovation  (Pl). The requirements
at the working  level were identified  and extracted,  and the information  thus obtained  was used in setting
up the BPM, the process-based  knowledge  management  system (PKMS), and the enterprise  information
display (EID) system. Among 50 core processes,  systemization  was completed  for the 25 processes
that were expected  to produce  the greatest  effects once the process  innovations  were up and running.
COMWEL  focused  on improving  its public service by eliminating  unnecessary  procedures  and simplifying
unnecessarily  complex  ones. Process  innovation  (Pl) was continuously  performed  around the framework  of
process  establishment  — monitoring  — improvement  activities  — process  establishment.
Through  process innovation,  when a user searches  for reference  data, the system provides  to the user
the information  that is most relevant  to the user’s query, As the amount  of information  accumulates  in
this system, the relevancy  of the information  multiplies.  In addition,  the management  was able to reduce
risks by quickly modifying  the management  strategies  after identifying  the management  plans and core
information  of all the business  units at a glance. In addition,  top management  was able to get a quick view
of the business  plans of all business divisions  and the key information  of the COMWEL  and make quick
changes  to its business  management  strategy  so as to reduce risk.
