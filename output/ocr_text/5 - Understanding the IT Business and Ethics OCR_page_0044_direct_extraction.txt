Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
IT business  must begin with the establishment  of a strategy before moving on to planning.  The two main activities
performed  during the IT business  planning  stage are the enterprise  architecture  (EA) and information  strategic
planning  (ISP). This is one of the ways of planning  from the macro perspective  and serves to prevent  indiscriminate  and
overlapping  development  activities  when a company  is pursuing  an IT business.
IT governance  provides  control over the implementation  of the EA and ISP and secures the linkage of the IT business
strategy  with IT values. It also provides  risk management,  resource  management,  and performance  measurement
systems.
The section on IT governance  describes  the concepts  and frameworks  of IT governance  and introduces  the areas of
focus of IT governance.  The EA section describes  the concepts  and components  of the EA and introduces  the EA
framework.  The ISP section introduces  the concept  of ISP and explains  the ISP deployment  procedure  as well as the
main outputs  of ISP deployment.
These plans - generated  during the IT business  planning  stage -  are first created  for the deployment  of IT business  and
then for the operation  of IT business  processes  and services,  eventually  leading to their utilization  in evaluations  of IT
business  performance.
02 IT Governance
A) Concept  of IT governance
The aim of IT governance  is to implant  a system for controlling  and managing  a company’s  IT to the same degree
as corporate  governance.  In other words, IT governance  can contribute  to realizing  business  targets by aligning IT
resources  with a company’s  goals and strategies.  By defining  the roles and responsibilities  within an organization,  IT
governance  creates a control and management  structure  for handling  the performance  results and risks of IT. The
table below gives some concrete  descriptions  of IT.
