01 What is the Protocol?
<Table 1> above showed many standard  protocols,  such as ARP, IP TCP, HTTP, DNS, and NAT. A protocol is a
standardized  communication  rule for sending  and receiving  data through  a network. The Internet,  as we know, is a
large group of networks  that connect  multiple  PCs and servers.
For tens or hundreds  of thousands  of PCs, servers, and routers that connect  them to exchange  data, it is necessary
to have a common  protocol  that can be found by each other, and there are several international  organizations  that
standardize  these protocols.
+ IETF (Internet  Engineering  Task Force) is responsible  for most Internet-related  standard  protocols.
+ 3GPP (Third Generation  Partnership  Project)  and 3GPP2 are responsible  for wireless  communication  protocols  such
as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, LTE, and LTE-A.
+ ITU-T (International  Telecommunication  Union Telecommunication  Standardization  Sector) is responsible  for
protocols  related to telephones.
Therefore,  it is necessary  to have the competitiveness  to understand  and implement  (if necessary)  the standard
protocols  enacted  by these standardization  organizations  to develop  software  in the network/communication  sector.
[Figure 12] below shows the details of [Figure 11] by reflecting  the network  protocol  concepts  described  above. When
a user searches  through  a web browser,  data requests  and response  data flow in the network  through  devices,  such
as the user’s computer,  a wired/wireless  router, a switching  hub, and a router, using the related protocols.  While the
physical layer is directly  connected  with hardware,  such as wires and switches,  and operates  with electric  signals, the
protocol  layer above the data link layer is implemented  and operated  in software.  Understanding  how many software
components  are connected  to each other for operation  should enable application  programs  or system  software  over
a network.  Later sections  describe  in detail how each protocol  layer shown in [Figure 12] works with the others in
each stage.
