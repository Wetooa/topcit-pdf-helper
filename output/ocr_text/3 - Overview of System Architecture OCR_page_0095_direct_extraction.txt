B) Backup  storage:  LTO and VTL
@ Linear  tape-open  (LTO)
LTO is a standard  open tape drive technology  that supports  high-speed  data processing  and  a large capacity.
Although  LTO refers to physical devices  and technology,  they are also used interchangeably.  It is also called the tape
backup machine,  tape media machine,  LTO machine,  LTO library, and LTO. LTO-1, first released in 2000, provided  a
maximum  speed of 20 MB/s at an uncompressed  capacity  of 100 GB. The LTO-8 that is currently  available,  supports
the performance  of a maximum  speed of 427MB/s  based on an uncompressed  capacity  of 12.8TB. The LTO-10 is
expected  to provide  a maximum  speed of 1100MB/s  at an uncompressed  capacity  of 48TB.
@ Virtual tape library (VTL)
VTL is a backup solution  that emulates  disk storage and makes it into a virtual tape device to compensate  for
problems  such as limited performance,  scalability,  and the recovery  time of existing  tape backup devices. Backup is
simplified,  and high-speed  backup  is enabled  through  tape virtualization.

04 Graphic  Compression  Technology
A) Graphic  compression  type
Video data compression,  which accounts  for most of the traffic in a multimedia  network,  can be divided  into lossless
compression  (reversible  compression)  and lossy compression  (irreversible  compression).  Lossless  compression  is also
called reversible  compression.It  refers to a method  of restoring  a compressed  image without  information  loss from the
original data while decompressing.  It is characterized  by a lower compression  rate than lossy compression.
Lossy compression  is also called irreversible  compression.It  refers to a compression  method when the compressed
data is restored,  but it does not match  the original  data before the compression  because  some data is lost.
