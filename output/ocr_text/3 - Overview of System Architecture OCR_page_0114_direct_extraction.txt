+ OS: An OS is defined as system software  that operates  and manages  an application  platform  and that provides
an interface  between  an application  program  and the platform.  The OS for the server includes  Linux, UNIX (BSD,
Solaris, etc.), Windows,  and macOS.  The OS for the server  market  is quite different  from the desktop  market,  which
is dominated  by Windows.  Linux and UNIX are the most widely used OS, followed  by Windows.  UNIX servers have
replaced  most mainframes,  and they were followed  by Linux, which is a UNIX-like  OS.
+ Webserver:  A webserver  provides  media content,  such as HTML and text, images, and video, to web clients, like
web browsers.  It provides  data through  the HTTP protocol  to enable a web browser  to present  information. Leading
webserver  products  include  Apache,  Nginx, and IIS (see [Figure 78]).
