Database
>> Recent  trends and major issues
SQL is the most important  and powerful  tool in a relational  database.  It is not an exaggeration  to say that
the strengths  of the relational  database  are being increasingly  highlighted  thanks  to the strong  function  of
SQL, which prevents  the relational  database  from being changed  to the object-oriented  DBMS or another
DBMS easily. Prior to the introduction  of SQL, the procedural  programming  language  had to be used for
simple data processing  only by writing a long programming  code. Since the introduction  of SQL, however,
the productivity  of database  programming  has improved  significantly,  because  the DBMS manages
everything  when the desired  data are specified.
