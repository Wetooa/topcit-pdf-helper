+ Key technologies  of self-driving  cars
The job of a self-driving  car is acquiring  information  and using this information  to drive the car safely. It requires
technologies  of recognition,  judgement,  and manipulation.  These technologies  become  integrated  with other
technologies  like AUTOSAR,  RTOS, and functional  safety technologies.
@ Smart Machine
Smart machines  that can be found in our surroundings  today are machines  that recognize  human voice and provide
answers  to questions  posed by users, e.g. Apple Siri or Google Home. Medical advisors  that provide  guidance  on
medical diagnosis  or drug use, and robots that assemble  things on behalf of people in factories  are also example  of
smart machines.
Smart machines  are defined as "a machine  that acts autonomously,  has intelligence  and self-learning  abilities, and
is able to judge and adapt itself to different  situations,  and performs  tasks that have been thought  to be impossible
except  for humans,"  #

+ Direction  of developments  in smart machines
Smart machines  are evolving  in a direction  where it can learn by itself and make its own rules, create and validate
hypothesis  and become  situational  aware and discover  the optimal solution,  in tandem  with advances  being made in
cloud computing,  Big Data and artificial  intelligence  (Al). In other words, it is approaching  the real concept  of a smart
machine.
