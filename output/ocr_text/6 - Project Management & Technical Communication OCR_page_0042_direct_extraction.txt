E) Business  documents
The nature of the document  is important  in communication,  but it plays an important  role in transcending
the limits of oblivion  and transforming  an “instantaneous  moment’  into a “permanent  record”,  and in business,
the clear basis for decision-making  is all made up of documents.  Therefore,  since documents  are written to
logically  explain or persuade  the plan or progress  of work, it is important  to structure  the logic to be explained
well (table of contents)  and describe  each of them, as the phrase “Simple is Best” implies. In terms of project
management,  it is safe to assume  that the success  and failure of project management  depends  on document
management,  and documentation  is a prerequisite  for productivity  improvement  such as recycling,  not just
coding as a developer.  The high productivity  of European  and American  countries  such as the U.S. (US produc-
tivity is three times that of Korea) is largely  driven by document  management,  and document  management  is
very important in quality management,  and document  management  has a significant  share in assessing  the
maturity  levels of organizations  as defined  in ISO, SPICE, and CMMI models,  etc.
® Types of Business  Documents
