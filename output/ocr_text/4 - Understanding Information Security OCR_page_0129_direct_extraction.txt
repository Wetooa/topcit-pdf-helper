@ IEEE 802.11i  operation
IEEE 802.111 operation  may vary depending  on the configuration  and device of the WLAN and can be described
by a five-step  operation,  as shown in [Figure 69].
(1) Search: The STA that wants communication,  searches  for the desired WLAN AP to generate  an SA with an
AP. using the function  that the AP broadcasts  security  policies.
(2) Authentication:  The STA and AS (authentication  server) authenticate  with each other. At this time, the AP
only transfers  communication  data between  the STA and the AS.
(3) Key generation  and distribution:  In this phase, the AS transfers  PMK (Pairwise  Master  Key) to the AP of the
STA, using the key distribution  protocol,  based on RADIUS (Remote  Authentication  Dial-In User Services).
After that, the AP and STA generate  and share the cryptographic  key, by exchanging  messages  using the
802.11x  protocol.
(4) Secure data transmission:  The STA and the other party’s end station securely  exchange  frames using the
AP. In this case, data is only transmitted  between  the STA and the AP.
(5) Disconnection:  The secure connection  of the AP and the STA is released  by exchanging  messages,  and the
original  connection  is restored.
