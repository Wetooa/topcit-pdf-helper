D) Defining  data standards
@ Overview  of deriving  standard  words
+ Standard  words are derived  from all terms that are dispersed  in each information  system by dividing  them into word
units.
+ Standard  words are extracted  from each of the entities and attributes  that are managed  throughout  the
organization.
+ The extracted  words are managed  along with physical names and similar terms based on logical names after
reorganizing  homophones  and synonyms.
+ The standard  word dictionary  should also define the structure  between  such words as synonyms,  antonyms,  etc. in
addition  to individual  words.
@ Word split
+ Splitting  the collected  terms into the basic words that are used for business  and have a certain meaning.
Eg. Resident  registration  number  — resident  + registration  + number
@ Processing  synonyms
+ Selecting  one representative  word for words with the same meaning  as a standard  word.
+ All words that are finally derived  should be unique in both their Korean  and English  abbreviations.
E.g. Unification  of the secret number,  passcode,  password  into the password.
@ Deriving  a standard  domain  dictionary
+ Each attribute  should be assigned  to a certain domain,  and cannot  be assigned  to more than one domain.
+ When a new attribute  is added, the domain  of that attribute  should be selected  and registered.
Eg. (Term) Resident  registration  number  - (Domain  name) Registration  number  - (Type) Char(13)
© Deriving  a standard  code dictionary
+ Standard  codes are defined  by checking  and integrating  the same codes after collecting  all of the codes used
throughout  the organization.
+ Derived  codes can be defined  from the standard  codes (e.g. Color code- wrapping  paper color).
