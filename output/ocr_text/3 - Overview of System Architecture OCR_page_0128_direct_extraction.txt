when it occurs.
[Table 25] DR Center  Types
Type Description RTO
- Construction  of the same facility, IT devices,  and network  resources  as the main center  in a
Mirrored  site remote  place Immediate
- Real-time  simultaneous  services  in the active-active  state
- Construction  of the same facility, IT devices,  and network  resources  as the main center  in a
remote  place Within 4
Hot site - Standby  state maintained  (Active-standby) hours
- Switching  the remote  system into the active state at the time of a disaster  at the main center
- Keeping  data up to date, through  synchronous  or asynchronous  real-time  mirroring
- Placing  of only crucial IT resources  at the DR center bays-
Warm site - Transferring  of critical components  in the main center  to the DR center  for operation  at the
time of the disaster weeks
- Only keeping  data in the remote  location,  but not IT resources,  for services  or only keeping
Cold site minimal  resources,  such as power, communication,  and network Weeks  -
- Replacing  the failed system by procuring  computer  components  and establish  a network  at months
the time of disaster
B) Disaster  recovery  goal
The most important  factors  to consider  when implementing  a DR system are RTO and RPO. RTO represents  the time
required  to return to normal operation,  when a disaster  or failure occurs in the operating  system.  RPO represents  an
indicator  of tolerable  data loss, i.e, the amount  of data that can be lost.
[Table 26] RTO and RPO
Type RTO
RPO Data loss converted  into time at the time of disaster
RTO Maximum  time to allow downtime
