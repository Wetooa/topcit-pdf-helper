Risk Identification Explanation
Method
. Investigate  the project  in terms of SWOT so that the scope of the identified  risks can be
SWOT Analysis expanded  to include internal risks.
Expert  Judgment Activities  in which experts  with similar project  or business  experience  directly  identify  risks
Risk, which is a key output of risk identification,  is described  as initially identified  in the Risk Register.  The
identified  risks are registered  in the risk register,  and qualitative/quantitative  analysis  is performed  to prioritize
the risks for risk response  planning.  The results of these activities  are recorded  in the risk register  so that
risks can be systematically  tracked/managed.

B) Risk analysis:  qualitative  risk analysis
Qualitative  risk analysis means qualitatively  analyzing  how much impact the risk has on the project at the
beginning.  Qualitative  risk analysis  refers to a method of prioritizing  risks by evaluating  the probability  and
impact  of risks after risk identification  is complete.  Probability-Impact  Matrix is a technique  that qualitatively
evaluates  the probability  of a risk and its impact  on the objective  and analyzes  it in a matrix form.

[Figure  45] Probability-Impact  Matrix (Example)
The risk level is “F(probability,  impact)  = probability  of occurrence  (P) X degree of impact  (I)’.
The probability  of occurrence  ranges from very low (0.1) to very high (0.9).
The impact  on the objective  ranges  from very low (0.1) to very high (0.8).
The risk level is calculated  by “probability  of occurrence  X impact” and the ratings are ranked as low, moder-
ate, and high for risk prioritization.
