01 Concept  and Types of Technical  Documents
A) Definition  of technical  documents
Technical  documents  are documents  that record the description  of reference  documents  or product  handling,
function  and architecture  development/use,  and provide sufficient  information  so that not only end users but
also administrators  and service/maintenance  technicians  can understand  the interior/exterior  of the product.
Therefore, it can be defined  as a document  written  by using a lot of terminology  according  to the communica-
tion method  of specialized  fields such as engineering,  technology,  and science.
In other words, a technical  document  contains  content  such as explaining  a specific  fact, persuading  the other
party, or instructing  certain actions. In recent years, the concept  has been expanded  to technical  communi-
cation, meaning  “any writing  and communication  for business  performance  regardless  of business,  industry,  or
specialized  field”.
B) Features  of technical  documents
@ Clarity
The meaning  of a word or sentence  should not be interpreted  or distorted  differently  by readers. In particular,
abstract  and metaphorical  rhetoric  should be avoided in that it may cause confusion  and in order to convey
accurate  content.
@ Accuracy
Technical documents  should be written  with accurate  content  to conform  to objective  facts based on various
materials or  data. In addition,  the process  of developing  the logic using the materials or data given based on
rational  thinking  must remain accurate  and consistent.
@® Structuredness
As seen in reports, manuals,  and proposals,  technical  documents  often have a certain format. The elements
(introduction,  body, conclusion,  etc.) that make up the form of the text should be structured  and written so as
to achieve  overall unity.
C) Types of technical  documents
Technical  documents  serve to provide readers with information  or to solve specific  problems.  Technical  doc-
uments  that are commonly  used in relation to SW development  are closely related to the SW development
project  and can be classified  as follows.
