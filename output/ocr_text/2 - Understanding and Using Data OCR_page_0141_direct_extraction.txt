Snowflake  schema+ Amodeling  technique  for completely  normalizing  the dimension  table of the star schema.
+ Data duplication  is rare, and few storage  spaces  are used owing to the normalization  of the
dimensional  table, but there is some concern  about performance  degradation  due to the
greater  number  of  joins compared  to the star schema.

03 Concept  of ETL (Extraction,  Transformation,  Loading)
ETL refers to the entire process by which data are extracted  from the source system and stored in the data
warehouse  after cleansing  and conversion.  It plays the role of maintaining  data consistency  and integrity  among  the
components  of the data warehouse,  and is also called ETT (Extraction  Transformation,  Transportation).
<Table 63> Work of each phase in ETL
Phase Main task
Extraction+ The phase in which data are extracted  from the original  file or operating  system  database  and
stored in the data warehouse.
+ In the past, data were extracted  on a daily or monthly  basis, but in some recent cases data
were extracted  in real time using database  logs according  to the business  requirements.
Transformation+ A phase in which extracted  data are cleaned  and converted  into a data format  suitable  for the
data warehouse.
+ In the event of data quality problems,  data are cleansed  according  to the reference  data or
business  rules.
+ The original data format is converted  into a data format  suitable  for the data warehouse.
Loading
140 TOPCIT  ESSENCE+ Aphase  in which converted  data are sent to the warehouse  for storage  and the necessary
indexes  are generated.
+ Full and partial  update  techniques  are available.
