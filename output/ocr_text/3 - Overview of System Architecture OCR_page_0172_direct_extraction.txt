[Figure 125] IPv4 Address  Designation  System
The IPv4 addressing  system consists  of a network  address,  assigned  by an Internet  address  resource  management
organization,  and a host address,  assigned  by a network  administrator  to identify  individual  hosts on the network.
As shown in <Table 51>, it is divided into Classes  A, B, C, D, and E, depending  on the network  size or the number  of
hosts. Classes  A, B, and C are for network  configuration  assigned  to general  users, Class  D is for multicast,  and Class
E is an address  reserved  for future use.
