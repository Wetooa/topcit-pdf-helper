process,thus  laying the foundations  for the production  of zero-defect  goods. With SPC, enterprises  can produce
high-quality  goods, and enhance  their productivity  to levels that will lead to significant  cost reductions,  thereby
contributing  to higher profits.
@ Constituent  elements  of SPC
<Table 33> Constituent  elements  of SPC
Component  elements Description
+ Aproduct  attributes  which indicates  the product’s  quality. Deviation  refers to the distribution  of
Deviation values around a central value or the trend of this value.
+ Deviations  occur mainly due to a common  caused  or an assignable  cause.6
Process  management + Managerial  ability for reducing  deviation.
and process + Deviations  are kept within the allowable  range of the product  by the repeated  elimination  of common
capability causes and assignable  causes. .
+ This refers to a schematic  diagram  of the deviation  trend caused by common  causes  and assignable
causes.
Distribution  and * Creating  a minimum  amount  of spraying  is an important  goal: In order to achieve  this goal, the cause
statistics of ‘coincidence’  must be continuously  managed  and the cause of ‘sputum’  removed.
+ Keeping  the distribution  to a minimum  range is an important  goal: In order to meet this goal, an
enterprise  must continuously  manage  the common  cause and eliminate  the assignable  cause.
Besides  the component  elements  described  above, statistical  data must be collected  for the variance  analysis.
The instruments  used in data collection  include the work log, checklists,  and inspection  device  data among other
things.
The statistical  techniques  used in SPC analysis  include the control chart, histogram,  scatter  plot, Pareto diagram,  and
cause-effect  diagram.
