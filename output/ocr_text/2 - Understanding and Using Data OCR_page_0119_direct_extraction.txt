<Table  47> Roles of the optimizer  in each query processing  phase
Query processing  phase Processing  details
Checks  whether  a more effective  query execution  plan is available  or not, merges  the sub-query
and view, and performs  OR expansion.
Query  optimization Determines  the access  path for the query.Query  rewrite
D) Classification  of optimizers  according  to criteria
@ Rule-based  optimizer  (RBO)
The rule-based  optimizer  sets the optimal path based on the ranking  according  to the index structure  or comparison
operator. It enables  the user to accurately  predict the path because  the optimizer’s  decision  is very regular  and clear.
However,  it has the limitation  that a serious  judgment  error may occur in terms of execution  performance  because
the realistic  factor (statistical  information)  is not considered.
@ Cost-based  optimizer  (CBO)
The cost-based  optimizer  calculates  the cost of each processing  method and selects the method  that costs the
least. Even though there is the advantage  of guaranteeing  minimum  performance  without having to have a deep
understanding  of the optimizer  through optimization control based on statistical  information  management  and
decision-making  in consideration  of reality, it has a limitation  in that an execution  plan cannot be forecast  and
controlled  easily.
05 Linking  the Web and Database
Web browser  components  and a gateway  that connects  the DBMS are required to link the web and database.
Depending  on the method of implementing  the gateway,  the methods  of linking the web and database  are divided
into server  extension  methods  and browser  extension  methods.
A) Server  expansion  methods
The server  extension  method  is also called a stateless  method.  A database  is connected  through  the web server, and
a connection  is established  each time a request  is made. These methods  include the CGI executable  file method,  CGI
application  server  method,  extended  API method,  and servlet  method.
@ CGl executable  file method
+ The CGI executable  file method  executes  the database  application  program  as a CGI (Common  Gateway  Interface)
executable  file. The CGI directly  accesses  the DBMS to retrieve  data. One application  process is created  for each
request.
* This method has the advantage  that the structure  is simple, and the method  can be implemented  using most
programming  languages.  In addition,  users can select one of the connection  methods  provided  by various database
vendors,  and it is very convenient  because  the user only has to modify  the CGI program  when expanding  the system.
+ However,  this method has the disadvantages  that the cost of content  replacement  increases  exponentially  when
