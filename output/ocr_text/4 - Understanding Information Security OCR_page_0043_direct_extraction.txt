© Public key certificate
Public key certificates  are X. Public key certificates  are issued by a public CA by complying  with the X.509
standard.  Public certificates  include  the NPKI certificates,  which are used by the public for financial  transactions
and e-commerce  transactions,  and the GPK! certificate,  which are used by administrative  agencies  for
administrative  work.
The public certificate  encryption  system began to be advanced  in 2011, and the length of the digital signature
key of the RSA algorithm  has been increased  from 1,024 bits to 2,048  bits. The hash function  was replaced  by
SHA-256  (a hash function  producing  a 256-bit  value), instead of SHA-1 (a hash function  producing  a 160-bit
value). <Table 12> shows the main contents  included  in the NPKI certificate.
<Table 12> Main contents  of the public key certificate
Contents Description
Version Version of the certificate  format
Serial number Auunique  integer  value that represents  the certificate  serial number  of the issuing  CA
Algorithm  identifier A signature  algorithm  OID (Object  Identifier)  used to generate  the certificate
Issuer The DN (Distinguishing  Name) of the CA that issued the certificate
Period of validity The validity  period of the certificate.  The start and expiration  dates are represented
in seconds.
Subject The DN of the certificate  owner.
Public-key  information The subject's  public key and the identifier  of the algorithm  that will use this key.
Signature Signed with CA's private key.
© Method  of verifying  the validity  of the certificate
* CRL (Certificate  Revocation  List)
CRL refers to the list of certificates  revoked by the CA. The list contains  the serial number, the revocation
date, and the reasons  for revocation.  According  to RFC 3280, the certificate  can be permanently  revoked  or
temporarily  held. The CRL should be periodically  downloaded  from the CRL distribution  point. If the download
cycle is too long, a revoked certificate  can be used. If the cycle is too short, the overhead  increases  each
time the certificate  is used.
* OCSP (Online  Certificate  Status Protocol)
This protocol  makes up for the shortcomings  that the CRL should be periodically  updated.  When the user
attempts  to gain access, the OCSP protocol  immediately  answers  the validity  of the certificate by requesting
certificate  status information  in real time. The protocol  is defined in RFC 6960, and generally uses a server
configured  with the HTTP.
