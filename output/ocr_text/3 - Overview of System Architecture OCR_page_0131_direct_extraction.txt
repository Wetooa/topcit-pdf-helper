<Table  27) Definitions  of “Cloud Computing”  and “Cloud Service”
Terms Definition
Cloud service An on-demand  outsourcing  IT service  that provides  a user-centered  cloud computing  environment
Cloud computingA computing  environment  that leases IT resources  through  the Internet,  based on virtualization  and
distributed  processing  technology  and pays a fee, based on usage
A) Comparison  of cloud computing  and other computing  technologies
@ Grid computing  and cloud computing
Grid computing  is defined  as "a structure  for virtualizing  and resources,  such as computers  and data, on a network  for
integration  and dynamically  creating  virtual computers  if needed.”  Grid computing  and cloud computing  are similar in
that they use a distributed computing  structure  and provide  virtualized  computing  resources.  The difference  is that
grid computing  uses all the computer  resources  on the Internet,  whil
owned by the operator.

@ Utility computing  and cloud computingapplications
Utility computing  is a type that provides  computing  resources  and charges  for the resources  used. Utility computing
and cloud computing  are similar, in that they charge for the resources  used. Cloud computing  has developed  the
abstraction  of computing  resources,  based on utility computing.
02 Cloud Computing  Types
A) Classification  according  to the service  type
Cloud services  can be classified  into laaS (Infrastructure  as a Service),  PaaS (Platform  as a Service),  and SaaS (Software
as a Service),  according  to the service  type.
@laaS
laaS provides  infrastructure  resources  (server, storage,  and network)  as a service  through  the Internet.  Although  the
