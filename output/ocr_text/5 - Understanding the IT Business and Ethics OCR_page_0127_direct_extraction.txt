ESSENCE
In new market disruption,  enterprises  target non-customers  who consciously  reject the products  in the market
or customers  who are dissatisfied  with existing  products.  By launching  innovative  new products  that utilize new
technologies,  the enterprises  try to build a presence  in niche segments  of the market  dominated  by existing  leading
companies.
In low-end  disruptive  innovation,  enterprises  target customers  who have been overserved  by leveraging  a new
process  and by employing  a financial  approach.  By using a combination  of low margin and high utilization  of resources,
enterprises  provide customers  with discounted  prices that are critical to succeeding  in the business.  In new market
disruptive  innovation,  enterprises  target non-consumers  who previously  could not afford to purchase  a product  or
who had no access to the technology  with low-feature  products  that are simple and convenient  to use. This is a
business  model in which enterprises  make money  with low-priced  products  that are mass produced  in small volumes,
The total takeover  of the mobile phone market  by smartphones  is a great illustration  of disruptive  innovation  at work.
The traditional  industry  shifted from a voice-centered  industry  to a data-serviced  industry  and from a hardware-
centered  (i.e. mobile terminal)  industry  to a platform-based  market  structure.  In addition,  if one examines  the impact
on other industry  sectors,  the high-performance  functions  installed  in smartphones  have obliterated  the markets  for
conventional  MP3, digital cameras,  game consoles,  car navigation  equipment,  and tablet PCs.
Smartphones  also created a variety of new markets  and business  models, including  app stores, location-based
services,  SNS, social commerce,  social games, Big Data, and smart  services.  Naturally,  there have to be some core
technologies  for such disruptive  innovations  to occur. Some of the latest technologies  driving disruptive innovations
that have recently  attracted  attention  include:
