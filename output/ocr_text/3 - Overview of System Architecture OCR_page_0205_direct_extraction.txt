RSVP is one of the IETF signaling  protocols,  and data flow is allocated  by a static bandwidth  by signaling  from end-to-
end. It basically  uses the method  of reserving  the queue space [2]. The RSVP message  starts from the source device
and is delivered  to all the receiving  devices  on the path. It is a path message  that contains  the necessary  information
for the receiver  and a message  sent by the receiver  upon receiving  the path message.  A RESV message  reserves  the
resource  of a router that moves toward the source device (upstream)  to support  RSVP. If a router on the path does
not support  RSVP, packets  are delivered,  based on the best-effort  delivery  method.
The priority method,  using the TOS field of IP datagram,  checks the 1-byte TOS field, as shown in [Figure 140], and
determines  the processing  priority, according  to the set value. The TOS class is divided into eight levels from class 0
to 7, and the higher the number,  the higher  the processing  priority.
Precedence,  the first field, indicates  the priority  or importance  of the packet,  and the TOS fields indicate  whether  the
network  maintains  a balance between  throughput,  delay, reliability,  and cost. The last MBZ (must be zero) field is a
field that is not currently  used.
The TOS field is expressed  as a 4-bit binary number.  <Table 73> shows the meaning  of each value.
(Table 73) TOS Field Values [4]
Binary  Value Meaning
1000 Priority  on delay minimization
0100 Priority  on processing  volume
0010 Priority  on reliability
0001 Priority  on cost minimization
0000 General  service
O2 Internet  Telephony  Concept  and Call Signal  Protocol
A) What is VoIP (Voice over Internet  Protocol)?
VoIP is a communication  technology  that facilitates  voice calls through  packet  data, based on the IP network. [Figure
142] shows the VoIP system structure.  The main service components  are the media gateway  and the signaling
gateway.  The media gateway  exchanges  multimedia  data, delivers  the changed  date to the corresponding  network,
and controls  it through  the media gateway  control protocol (MGCP).  The signaling  gateway  performs  call signaling,
using protocols,  such as H.323, SIP MGCP, and MEGACO,  and converts  the signals of the PSTN and IP networks, so
they can be used with each other.
