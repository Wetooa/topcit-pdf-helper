[Figure 57] OSI 7-layer  reference  model
<Table 35> shows the protocols  and functions  corresponding  to each layer of the OSI 7-layer  reference  model.
<Table 35> Protocols  and functions  of each layer of tlhe OSI 7-layer  reference  model
Layer Protocol Function
Application HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, FTP, Provides  services,  such as user interface,  e-mail, and database
layer Telnet, SSH, DNS, etc. management,  to users.
ae JPEG, MPEG, XDR, etc. Converts  transmitted  data using a common presentation  method.
Session  layer TLS, RPC, NetBIOS,  etc.Manages  communication  sessions.  Sessions  between  communication
devices  are established,  maintained,  and synchronized.
Transport  layer TCP, UDP, SCTP etc.Perform  data transmission  and error control between  the source and
destination  (end-to-end)  process.
Network  layerIP. IPX, ICMP, X. 25, ARP, OSPF,
etc.Responsible  for transferring  packets,  from the source,  to the destination
host, in multiple  network  environments.
Data link layerEthernet,  Token Ring, wireless
LAN, etc.Transfers  frames  from one device  to another,  without  errors
Physical  layerRadio wave, coaxial cable, UTP
optical fiber, etc.Converts  bits into signals  and transmits  them using physical  media.
The structure of the TCP/IP used for the ARPANET  reference model that appeared  earlier than the OSI 7-layer
reference  model and is composed  of three layers, as shown in [Figure 56].
+ Application  layer: Provides  application  services,  including  web (HTTP), DNS, Telnet, FTP, e-mail sending/
receiving  (SMTP/POP3/IMAP4),  etc. This layer runs using the services  provided  by the lower layer and the
