[Fig. 21] Conceptual  diagram  of IT business  outsourcing  adoption  process
When a company  opts for IT outsourcing,  it begins by identifying  its core competencies  and selecting  the tasks to be
outsourced.  Once the target  task has been selected,  the vendor  will be chosen,  and negotiations  will proceed  until a
contract  is signed. The most important  task is for the company  and the vendor  to reach a clear-cut  agreement  on
how the index for service levels will be managed.
C) Forms of outsourcing
IT business  outsourcing  can take one of four forms.
<Table 18> Forms  of IT business  outsourcing
Form
Total Outsourcing
Selective  Outsourcing
IT Subsidiary  Company
Outsourcing
Co-SourcingDescription
The entire IT functionality  is subcontracted  to a single vendor,  and the accountability  is clear cut
and the job handling  efficiency  can be improved.  But the absence  of competition  can give rise to
monopolistic  issues.
The selected  function  or job unit is subcontracted  to multiple  vendors. Price and quality
improvements  can be expected  from competition  among  vendors.  However,  accountability  issues
may arise when problems  occur, and there could be difficulties  when communicating  the exact
customer  requirements.
The IT functionality  is outsourced  to a subsidiary  company  specializing  in IT, which is established
solely for the purpose.  This is a form of outsourcing  that can yield benefits  like improved
communication  and unity by promoting  a sense of solidarity  among  employees.  However,
associated  costs could increase  and, if the subsidiary  is not profitable,  it could become  a risk to the
parent  company.
IT planning,  IT strategy,  and IT service  activities  are separated.  This is a form of adoption  that offers
advantages  in a rapidly  evolving  environment,  and the problems  of total outsourcing  can be partly
addressed.  However,  some coordination  may be required in the event of a gap between  strategy
and performance.
D) Considerations  when adopting  outsourcing
In the course of outsourcing  an IT business,  a company  will come across many types of problems.  To address  these
problems,  the following  steps could be considered:
