@ Mutual  takeover  (Active-active)
The mutual takeover  is the case of two or more systems  operating  with separate  servers. When  a server fails, its
services  are switched  to the designated  server (takeover)  to continue  the services.  Each server must have sufficient
system  capacity  in order to provide  services  for the two servers,  in preparation  for a fail-over  at the time of a failure.

@® Concurrent  access
It is a structure  in which multiple  systems  process  tasks in parallel in order to provide  availability.  All servers  operate
in an active state. Even if a server  fails, the service  continuity  can be guaranteed  without  a fail-over.  In this structure,
two or more servers  perform  load balancing,  using an L4 switch to perform  the same task.
