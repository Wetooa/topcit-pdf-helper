value, even though  the attacker  finds the hash value of the password  “@Kr5792cc’.  In addition,  if different  salts
are used for each user, the hash values of the users who use the same password  are generated  differently,
which significantly  improves  the problem  of the possibility  of recognition.
The hash values of the salt and password  can be stored in the server database,  then, when the user logs in,
the input password  can be checked  by hashing  it. It is known that to make salt and digest difficult  to guess, all
passwords  should have their own salt, and the salt length should be 32 bytes or more.

+ Integrity  verification  method
Integrity  verification  methods  in servers or network  security,  are divided into the method of detecting  an
error that occurs  while transmitting  data, and the method  of preventing  unauthorized  modification,  as shown
in <Table 6>. A checksum  and cyclic redundancy  check (CRC) are used to test integrity  when an error occurs
during data transmission.  The checksum  method,  a type of duplicate  test, tests integrity  by adding data to
obtain a checksum,  converting  it into a certain bit value, then adding it to the message.
CRC is mainly used as a method of verifying  transmission  data errors in the communication  system, such
as the Internet.  A checksum  is calculated  at the sending  side, based on polynomials  that are easy to detect
and corrected  errors, and it is sent after adding it to the header. Then, the receiving  side verifies integrity  by
calculating  the checksum  again, based on the same polynomial  and comparing  it with the received  checksum.

+ File integrity
To ensure integrity  when sending  files on the Internet  or posting  them on a website,  assistant  manager  Kim
secured  a method  of verifying  that files are not tampered.  To do so, he also sends, or posts hash values that
are calculated  by the hash function.  He also decided  to manage  the alteration  status as shown in [Figure 12].
He makes  a list of important  source files managed  by the server, and stores  the hash value for each file, then
compares  the hash value in the file list with the original hash value on a regular  basis.
