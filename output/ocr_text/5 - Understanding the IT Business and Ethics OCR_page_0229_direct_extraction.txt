© Trolley dilemma
There is a trolley dilemma  suggested  by Philippa Foot, a British ethical philosopher, as a thought  experiment  related
to the ethical dilemma  of self-driving  cars and drones.  The trolley dilemma  is an experiment  on whether  it is morally
permissible  to sacrifice  five workers  on the rail on which the train travels, or one other worker  on the other rail, in a
situation  where the trolley train with broken brakes is running.  This experiment  is often cited in relation to which of
the drivers  or pedestrians  to protect  in the accident  of an autonomous  vehicle.
