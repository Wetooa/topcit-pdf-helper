Overview  of System Architecture )
external  networks.  A network's  devices  and roles vary, based on the OSI layer 7 standard.  Network  devices  include
switches,  routers, load balancers  (L4/L7 load balancers),  and bridges.  Additionally,  AP (access  point) is used in
wireless  networks.  There is an overlap between  the network  domain and the security  domain. Since most of the
hacking  attacks  intrude  through  the network,  the internal network  (LAN) gate, connected  to the external  network
(WAN), is protected  by a security  device.
+ Storage
A storage system holds the data of an information  system.  It is categorized  into three types according  to how
it stores data. Block storage saves data in fixed block units, like 16KB and 64KB. It stores the OS, such as MS
Windows,  Linux, and Unix. File storage  saves data in file units, instead  of in fixed blocks. Network  attached  storage
(NAS), widely used as the shared file repository,  is a type of file storage.  Object storage  saves data in object units,
instead of in fixed blocks or files. It is mostly used in cloud storage.  Storage  types can also be categorized  by their
connection  method.  Direct access storage  (DAS) is mounted  in each server, NAS is connected  through  a network,
and storage  area network  (SAN) is connected  through  the network  used exclusively  for storage. DAS can only be
used with a filesystem  and includes  IDE, SATA, and SAS. SAN is provided  to the OS through  an SAN network,  and it
requires  the creation  of a filesystem  before it can be used as DAS. It includes  SAN, iSCSI, and FCoE. NAS becomes
usable after it is mounted  to the OS. It includes  NFS, CIFS, and AFS.

+ Security
Information  security  is configured  through  the network  connection.  Some security  hardware  is installed between
the external  Internet  section and the internal network  to protect  the internal systems,  while some are installed  in
the internal network. It includes  the DDoS defense  system to defend against  DDoS attacks,  firewalls  to protect  the
system through  monitoring,  logging,  and blocking  network  traffic, and IPS/IDS  to prevent  abnormal  traffic or abuse.
It also includes  web firewalls  protect  webservers  by logging, monitoring,  blocking  web service traffic, and access
control solutions  to provide management  functions  that allow or to deny access  to servers.
