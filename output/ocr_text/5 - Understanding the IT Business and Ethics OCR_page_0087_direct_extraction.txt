The deployment  of ERP should be approached  as a concept  of enterprise  business innovation,  and not just as the
simple introduction  of a system. The legacy operating  procedures  of the enterprise  must be analyzed,  and any
problems  and improvement  points must be identified.  Through  process  innovation  (PI) activities,  the enterprise  must
undergo  a radical transformation.  Job activities  must be innovated  so that they can be performed  by employees  from
a common  perspective  and handled  using standardized  procedures  that are integrated  across the enterprise.  To this
end, the ERP implementation  project must be wholeheartedly  supported  by the CEO and pursued  at the company
level in order for it to be successful.  The typical ERP implementation  process  includes  the following:
