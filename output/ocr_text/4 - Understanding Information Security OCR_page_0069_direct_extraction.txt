Information  security )
When the retention  period of collected  personal  information  has expired, or the purpose  of use has been
achieved,  personal  information  must be destroyed,  without  delay, in an irrecoverable  way. If the personal
information  must be retained  according  to other laws and regulations,  it must be stored separately  from
personal  information  that is currently  in use.
To store separately,  a separate  database  can be generated  and stored, or data can be stored in a physically
separated  server. The access  rights of the general personal  information  database  should be set differently  from
the personal  information  database  that is stored separately,  in order to prevent  unnecessary  access,  inquiries,
and leakage.
® Access  control on the personal  information  processing  system
Those who handle personal  information  should control unauthorized access by limiting the access rights, in
order to prevent illegal access and breach incidents  to the personal  information  processing  system,  and to
detect illegal attempts  to leak personal information  by analyzing  the connected  IP addresses.  The access
control method  includes  ACL (Access  Control List), firewall,  and free intrusion  detection  system (Snort).
@® Applying  encryption  when storing  and transmitting  personal  information
+ Encrypting  personal  information  to prevent illegal exposure  or forgery/alteration,  when storing it in the
personal  information  processing  system or transmitting  it through  the network.
+ Storing  passwords  after one-way  encryption  to prevent  decryption.
+ Developing  a system by including  the feature that can provide a temporary  password  or reset the password,
since the password  cannot  be decrypted  when lost.
+ Storing uniquely  identifiable  information,  such as the resident  registration  number, passport  number,
driver's license number,  and foreign registration  number, and bio information,  such as fingerprint,  iris, voice,
handwriting,  etc., after encryption  with a secure encryption  algorithm.
+ Applying  encryption  systems,  such as SSL/TLS  to the personal  information  transmission  section.
® Managing  the logging  and storage  of access records  and changes  to rights
Those who handle personal  information  should retain and manage  the access record of the personal
information  system  for at least 6 months.  Access records are the data that can check for illegal access by
generating  log files, which keep track of personal  information  input/output  and modification,  data access
details, etc.
03 Information  security  standards  and related  systems
A) ISO 27001:2013
ISO 27001:2013,  an international  standard  for information  security  management  systems  and certification
systems,  enables  the applicant  to receive existing  quality management  certification  (ISO 9001), environmental
management  certification  (ISO 14001), etc. together  with ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 (ISMS2.0),  which are
