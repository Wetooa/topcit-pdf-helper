All systems  of major domestic  broadcasting  companies  and financial  companies  were paralyzed,  due
to exposure  to cyber terror, on March 20, 2013. The internal computer  networks  of 3 broadcasting
companies  and 4 financial  companies  were down all at once, around 2 pm on this day, and serious
confusion  occurred.  As computer  networks  at similar institutions  were down at the same time,
the police suspected  a high possibility  of cyber terror and began an investigation.  The Korea
Communications  Commission  announced  that the incident  was caused by malware,  distributed  by
the update management  server (PMS), and the extent of the damage  was so enormous  that it was
difficult  to estimate.
Financial  company  A, a hacking  victim, analyzed  three major causes  of hacking  damage:
1) The administrator  PC was not secure enough and servers  could be accessed  from the IP address,
other than that of the administrator.
2) Security  patches  were not applied properly,  and authentication  of the updated  server  was weak.
3) Default passwords  were used, and the use of unnecessary  commands  were not restricted.
Let’s learn how to set security,  according  to the system characteristics,  to effectively  respond  to
cyber-attack  damage,  such as in the case of company  A, and how to manage systems  safely, based
on such understanding.
