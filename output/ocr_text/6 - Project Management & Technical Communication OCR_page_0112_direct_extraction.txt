ue is the budgeted  cost of work that has actually  been performed.  Earned  value is also called BCWP (Budgeted
Cost of Work Performed).
+ EV, Earned Value = Value of work performed  = Budgeted  Cost of Work Performed
B) Earned  value management
Earned Value Management  (EVM) is a project  performance  management  technique  that analyzes  performance
through  integrated  management  of project  schedule  and cost, and predicts  the cost and schedule  of the final
project  at the present  time.

EVM is a technique  to control project  performance  by integrating  cost and schedule.  The related terms are as
follows:
<Table 50> Key Terms of EVM
Key Terms Explanation
+ The allocated  budget  for the work performed  to dateCee (Example)  5 days 80% (progress  rate) = 5*0.8 = 4 days
+ The approved  (planned)  budget  for the work performed  to complete  an activity  or
PV: Planned  Value component  in the WBS
(Example)  5 days
+ The costs actually  incurred  for the work completed
ME AeuEllesst (Example)  Add 1 person and 1 day to the 5-day activity = 5 days*1 person + 1 day*1 = 6 days
+ Ameasure  of actual progress  against  expected  progress
SV: Schedule  Variance + SV > 0: ahead of schedule,  SV < 0: behind schedule
+ SV=EV  - PV, 4-5 = -1 day, 1 day behind schedule
+ Ameasure  of actual progress  against  expected  progress
+ SPI=EV/PV
+ SPI > 1: on or ahead of schedule,  SPI < 1: behind scheduleSPI: Schedule
Performance  Index
+ Ameasure  of actual cost against  the budgeted  cost
CV: Cost Variance + CV  > 0: under budget,  CV < 0: over budget
+ CV=EV-AC,  4-6 = -2, 2 days over budget
+ Ameasure  of actual cost against  the budgeted  cost
+ CPI=EV/AC
+ CPI> 1: on or under budget,  CPI < 1: over budgetCPI: Cost Performance
