Database )
+ System-centered  processing  method.  (Low processing  cost and high system  performance  are required.)
+ Preparatory  work is required.  (Collecting,  classifying,  and organizing  raw data -> Writing  in a file)
+ Standby  time is required.  (Immediate  processing  is not supported.)
+ The procedure  of modifying  changes  is complex  and difficult  until files are processed  collectively.
+ Example:  Payroll processing  system,  grade processing  system,  utility bill processing  system,  etc.
@ Online processing  system
+ When data are transferred  to a computer,  the computer  immediately  processes  the data. (Real-time  processing
system)
+ User-centered  processing  method.  (It incurs a high processing  cost and low system  performance  is required.)
+ Preparatory  work is not required.
+ Data currency  is maintained.
* Difficult  to maintain,  repair, or restore,
+ Example:  Seat reservation  processing  systems  for airlines and railroads,  bank deposit  processing  systems,  stock
account  systems  for securities  companies,  etc.
@ Distributed  processing  system
+ Data are processed  by connecting  processors  and databases,  which are geographically  dispersed,  over the network.
+ Operated  in the form of a client/server  system.
+ Improves  the operation  speed and reliability.
+ Increases  the efficient  use of resources.
+ Software  development  is difficult,  and the security  level and degree  of design complexity  are relatively  high.
O2 Understanding  the Database
A) Concept  and characteristics  of the file processing  system
The term ‘file processing  system’  refers to a method  of storing  and retrieving  paper documents  that was widely used
before the computer  was invented.  However,  the meaning  of the term began to include  computerized  records  in the
1960s. Such  a file system is designed  to arrange and manage the data recorded  by the user on a physical disk. In
general,  a hierarchical  file system  with a directory  structure  is used.
Each application program  in a file system accesses  an individual  file to process,  in order to search, input, delete, and
modify  it.
For example,  if a file system is used when a certain web service system saves the user’s log-in history,  the application
program  that saves the login history has a unique form according  to the characteristics of the application program,
depending  on the sequence  in which the information  to be saved is arranged,  and the unit of classification  of such
information.
@ Characteristics  of the file processing  system
+ The application  program  should directly  implement  the logical file structure  designed  by the application  programmer
