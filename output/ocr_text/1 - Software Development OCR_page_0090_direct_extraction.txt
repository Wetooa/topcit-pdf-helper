Selecting  a programming  language
In a real enterprise  environment,  the selection  criteria for programming  languages  for the
development  of products  and services  are determined  in various ways. Hardware,  OS environment,
introduced  solutions,  business characteristics,  application  of the latest development  languages,
and the status of available  developers are just some of these criteria. However,  it is true that an
alternative  language  is selected  if there are only a few developers  and labor costs are excessively
high, even though  the given development  language  is eminently  usable.
For example,  if Java is selected  to implement  all the functions  of a given project  to develop  a system
with numerous  batch-like  tasks, then the project is likely to face the difficult  problem  of having to
improve batch performance.  Alternatively,  if the C language  is selected in order to improve  speed
only, there is a high possibility  that the project  will be faced with the difficult  problem  of productivity
and test coverage.
Therefore,  the reality is that many projects  select a programming  language  based on experience,
and various languages  and architectures  are applied in the same project.  In particular,  complexity  and
diversity  increase  significantly  in recent development  projects  that require mobile services in various
fields.
Software  development  framework  and integrated  development  environment  (IDE)
These days, software  developers  collaborate  with developers  around the world who use different
languages  and different  versions  of the compiler  and may have to write new codes or maintain
the software,  which itself may use an old library that is more than 10 years old. To adapt to the
rapidly changing  business  environment,  the methods  of collaboration,  customer  support,  and coding
are changing.  Also, an integrated  development  environment based on a continuous  integration
environment  is created to provide services  on time. The framework  consists  of an execution
environment,  development  environment, operation  environment, and management  environment.  It
also improves  development  productivity  by maximizing  modularization  and reusability,  and provides
various  libraries  that can improve  software  quality.
