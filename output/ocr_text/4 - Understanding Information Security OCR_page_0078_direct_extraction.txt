@ Secure  coding  technique  for responding  to the Cross Site Scripting  (XSS) attack
+ Attack overview:
An attacker  can insert a malicious script into a web page to induce the user to execute  it. For example,  if an
unverified  external  input is used to create a dynamic  web page, it can cause an attack, such as information
leakage, because  inappropriate  script is executed  with the rights of the person who views the transmitted
dynamic  webpage.

script]
[Figure  36] XSS security  vulnerability
+ Coding  technique:
Special  characters  such as <>& “, should be replaced  with &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot: using a character  conversion
function  or method,  in order to prevent  script insertion  into the external  input value. If a bulletin board allows
HTML tags, allowed  HTML tags should be created  as a whitelist  to support  only those tags.
<Table 10> Safe coding  example
String name = request.getParameter(‘name’);
if(name  != null)
{
name = name.replaceAlll("<”,  “&lt:”);
name = name.replaceAll(">”,  “&gt:’);
(8, “&amp;’);
("Safe code name = name.replacedl
name = name.replaceAlll("\"\"”,  “&quot:”);
}
Strings  related  to script in the ‘name’,  which is entered  by the user, should be filtered  and converted.

+ Attack overview:
If the user input, that has not been properly  verified, is configured  and executed  as part or all the operating
system  commands,  unintended  system commands  may be executed,  which may improperly  change  the rights
or negatively  affect the system  operation.
