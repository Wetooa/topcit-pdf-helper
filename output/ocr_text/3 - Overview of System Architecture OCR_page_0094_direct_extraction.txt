@ RAID-6  (Stripe set with dual distributed  parity)
RAID-6 is similar to RAID-5, except that while RAID-5 stores one parity, RAID-6  redundantly  stores a parity in two
drives. The configuration  is more durable  than RAID-5  and can store data safely. In a RAID-5  configuration,  the rebuild
time restores  data to the new drive when  a drive fails and is replaced. The rebuilding  takes a long time in a storage
system  with a large storage  capacity.  If another  drive fails during  this rebuilding  time, there is a possibility  of data loss.
Therefore,  RAID-6 is recommended.

© RAID-10(Striping  & Mirroring)
RAID-10  requires  at least four drives and is a combination  of RAID-O and RAID-1 to improve  |/O speed while
providing  data stability.  It eliminates  the concern  with stability,  which is an important  drawback  of RAID-O, and it
can significantly  improve  performance,  which is the biggest  drawback  of RAID-1. However,  its disadvantage  is that
the cost is high. RAID 1+0 configures  two drives in mirroring  first, then RAID-1 drives, configured  of two drives, are
configured  in RAID-0.  RAID 0+1 divides  the drives to be configured  in half, configures  them in RAID-O,  and reconfigures
Ys of the drives and the remaining  1/2 of the drives in RAID-1. The RAID-10  configuration  features  better stability  and
generally  uses RAID-10  more than RAID-O+1.
