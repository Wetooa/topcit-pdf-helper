+ User stories: Refers to a tool for collecting  requirements  and communication.  User stories briefly describe
necessary  matters  regarding  functions.
+ Spike: A simple program  that considers  difficult  requirements  or potential  solutions.  Spike aims to increase
the reliability  of user stories while reducing  the risk of technical  problems.
+ Release planning:  Establishes  a deployment  plan for an entire project and divides one iteration  into one to
three weeks,  and then keeps the iterations  evenly.
+ Acceptance  test: An acceptance  test performed  by the customer  before release.
+ Smaller  releases:  The final phase of the XP cycle. If frequently  released  on a small scale, several benefits  can
be provided  to the customer  in the early stages.
@ XP values
Basically,  eXtreme  Programming  proposes  the following  five values.
* Communication:  Communication  is the most important  thing in software  development  at the team level.
Communication  errors are typically  found in failed projects.  Problems  should be solved, and team building
should be strengthened  through  communication  between  customers,  developers  and managers.
+ Simplicity:  Always ask “What is the simplest  thing possible?”.  Keep the design simple and clear by removing
unnecessary  complexity.
+ Feedback:  Gradual improvement  is more effective  than pursuing  perfection,  considering  the flow of changes
which causes yesterday's  output or value to become  useless  today. Create as many feedback  as possible
quickly  as long as they can be handled  by the team and use them for improvement.
+ Courage:  Cope with changes  to the requirements  and technology  to reflect them as quickly as possible
and deliver to the customer.  The courage to actively  solve a problem entails simplicity,  and the courage  to
present  the solution  concretely  reinforces  feedback.
+ Respect:  Respect  is the value that hides behind the first four. A person cannot implement  the project
properly  without  respecting  the other members  of the team. (Source: Korea Developer's  Hope Report)
