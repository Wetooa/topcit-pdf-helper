Information  security )
malware or e-mails for spear phishing  attacks using your distributed  e-mail addresses.  In addition,  it is
necessary  to change  the account  password  periodically,  because  hackers  can send e-mails  for spear phishing
to the recipients  saved in the e-mail address  book, if the e-mail account  is hacked.
+ Backing  up important  data regularly
Important  data should be backed up regularly  because  important  documents  and files cannot  be read or used
if encrypted  after infection  with ransomware.  Anti-virus  programs  may prevent  infection  with malware  or they
may remove  malware,  butthey  cannot  decrypt  the encrypted  documents.  Therefore, important  documents  or
files should be backed up regularly  to a separate  external  storage  device and stored in a safe place.
H) Drive by download  attack
Recently,  malware  is distributed  using a drive-by  download  method that infects the user PC with malware  as
soon as the user accesses  a malicious  web site while surfing  the web, instead  of attacking  a vulnerable  service
through a network.  Malware  distribution,  using the drive-by  download  method, can infect a user’s device
without  the user’s knowledge,  andit can infect multiple  users at the same time, using the web server accessed
by multiple  users as an attack medium.  The user PC infected  with malware  in this process  can cause secondary
damage,  such as the DDoS attack, spam e-mail sending, and theft of personal  information,  without  the user's
knowledge  in the same way.
|) “Fileless”  attack  without  malware  installation
Generally,  when an attached  file is executed  or a malicious  executable  file is clicked, an external attacker
invades the system and infects it with malware.  Fileless attacks do not execute  a file, but mainly use a
vulnerability  in a web browser  to infect malware  when a user clicks a link to a malicious  site. This attack
technique  uses PowerShell*,  which is installed  through  Windows  7, and command  utility (WMIC)**,  which is a
Windows  management  tool, to make an attack. Such an attack may be difficult  to detect using an anti-virus
tool because  software  is not installed  on the user’s PC.
* PowerShell:  A task-based  shell and scripting  language,  specifically  designed  for system management.
PowerShell  is used to easily control and automate  the management  of Windows  OS and application  programs.
** WMIC (Windows  Management  Instrumentation  Command):  A system command  input tool for Windows
management,  provided  by Windows.
J) Malvertising
Malvertising  is a compound  word of malware  and advertising.  Malvertising  is a technique  of distributing  malware
using online advertising.  The malvertising  technique  inserts malware  by spreading  advertising  into the normal
online advertising  network  or web site. Online advertising  provides  the best environmental  conditions  for
spreading  malware  because  it displays  the topics that can attract the attention  of visitors,  or it is posted on
the site with a high number  of visitors. In addition,  the risk of malware  infection  increases  exponentially  in
online advertising,  because  it is linked with numerous  normally  operated  websites  and can easily distribute
malware  in large quantities,  even if an attacker  does not directly  hack each website.
