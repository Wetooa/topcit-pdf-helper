@ Strengths  of compiler  languages
+ Translated  object codes can be saved.
+ Executable  immediately  after compilation.
+ The reused program  can be executed  quickly  after compilation
@ Shortcomings  of compiler  languages
* Conversion  to machine  language  takes  a long time.
+ Memory  is wasted sometimes  because  one line of raw program  is translated  into hundreds  of lines of machine
language.
02 Characteristics  of Major Programming  Languages
A) C language
® Introduction  to the C language
The C language  was developed  by Dennis Richie, who worked  at AT&A’s  Bell Lab on the UINX operating  system
in the 1970s. Most computer  languages  are motivated  by the C language,  and most of the famous operating
systems,  like iOS and Android,  are written in C.
@ Characteristics  of the C language
+ Execution  is fast, and memory  can be managed  efficiently  and easily.
+ Functions  can be implemented  with paragraphs  because  the notation  is concise.
+ Procedure-oriented  language:  Programs  are executed  according  to the specified  sequence.
+ More difficult  to use than Java because  a program  in consideration  of the array and memory  is needed.
+ Porting  is difficult  when the execution  environment  and machine  are changed.
B) C++ language
@ Introduction  to the C ++ language
C++ is suitable  for system programming  because  it contains  most of the features  of the C language, and is also
suitable  for object-oriented  programming  by supporting  classes,  operator  overloading,  and virtual functions.
If software  is developed  using an object-oriented  programming  technique,  it is easy to write a large-size  program,
and programs  are easy to read because  software  reusability,  scalability,  and maintainability  are increased.
@ Characteristics  of the C ++ language
+ Object  orientation  characteristics:  C++ reflects  the characteristics  of object  orientation  as a language  that is
developed  from the C language  to support  object-oriented  programming.
+ Encapsulation  and data hiding aspects:  The class, a characteristic  of C++, is frequently  used in encapsulated
form, and the actual internal  working  structure is hidden. Therefore, the user needs to know how to use the
class without  knowing  how it works.
