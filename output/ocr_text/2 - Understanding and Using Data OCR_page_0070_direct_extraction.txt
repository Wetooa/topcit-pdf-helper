01 Normalization  and Anomalies
Various anomalies  can occur when performing  data processing  operations  in a database  that has been poorly
designed  without  strictly considering  the relationship  between  data attributes,  particularly  dependencies  between
attributes.  Representative  anomalies  include an insertion  anomaly,  deletion  anomaly,  and update anomaly.  These
anomalies  are explained  in <Table 25>.
<Table 25> Table showing  mixed student  information  and department  information  (primary  key = “student  ID”)
Student  ID Name Gender Department  name Department  office
1111 Hong Gildong Male Computer  engineering Engineering  building
2222 Ryu Gwansun Female Computer  engineering Engineering  building
. Natural  science3333 Gang Gamchan Male Physics building
A) Insertion  anomaly
@ Definition:  An anomaly  in which unintended  information  is also inserted  when inserting  certain information.
(Example)  When inserting  the information  (Department  name = “Management  information’,  Department  office =
“Management  Building’)  into the table in <Table 25>.
+ Entity integrity  is lost if only the department  name and department  office values are inserted,  because  the primary
key (“Student  ID”) becomes  null.
+ To maintain  entity integrity,  the department  name and department  office information  must be inserted  together
with the student  ID of the student  belonging  to the Department  of Management  Information  Technology.
B) Deletion  anomaly
@ Definition:  An anomaly  in which necessary  information  is also deleted  when deleting  certain information.
(Example)  When deleting  the information  of (Student  ID="3333’)  in <Table 25>.
+ If this student  is the only student  belonging  to the “Physics  Department’,  the information  that the department
office of the “Physics  Department’  is in the “Natural  Science  Building’  is also deleted.
C) Update  anomaly
@  Definition:  An anomaly  in which the same content  should be updated  for several data repeatedly  when modifying
certain information.
(Example)  When the office of the “Department  of Computer  Science and Engineering”  is changed  to the “Future
Building’  in <Table 25>.
+ Modification  operations  should be performed  as many times as the number  of students  belonging  to the “Department
of Computer  Engineering”.
