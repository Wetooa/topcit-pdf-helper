Overview  of System  Architecture
With DMA, high-speed  |/O devices can increase  system efficiency  by minimizing  the interruption  overhead  that
reduces  the CPU's actual processing  time.

@ DMA operation  sequence
@® The I/O interface  requests  a DMA service  from the DMA controller.
@ The bus request  is transferred  to the CPU's HOLD pin, so that the DMA acquires  the control  of the bus (Active High).
® The bus grant is returned  from the CPU's HLDA (Hold Acknowledge)  pin, to the DMAC (Active  High).
@® The DMAC loads the contents  of the address  register  into the address  bus.
© The DMAC transfers  the DMA acknowledgment  to the I/O interface  in order to load the data into the data bus.
© The address  bus transfers  the data bytes to the identified  memory  location.
@ The I/O interface  maintains  the data transfer  (Latch).
The DMAC returns  the bus grant as the bus request  is dropped,  and the HOLD becomes  a low state.
© The bus grant is dropped,  and HLDA becomes  a low state.
Afterward,  the address  register  increases  by increments  pf 1, and the byte count decreases  by decrements  of 1.
@ The process  retums  to Step © if the byte count is not 0, and otherwise  stops.

Type Description
- The fast CPU gives the slow DMA the priority  of using the bus to enable  fast inputs and outputs
Cycle stealing when the DMA controller  and the CPU intend to use the bus at the same time.
- Itis applied  when transferring  data of about one word during  a DMA operation.
- It is applied  when transferring  data in blocks during  a DMA operation.
- It continuously  transfers  blocks  formed by multiple  memory  words.
- It is applicable  to high-speed  I/O devices.  When a DMA interface  acquires  the bus grant, it
monopolizes  the bus cycle until the data transfer  is complete.Burst mode
