03 Index Design
A) Functions  of the index
© An index is a data structure  that organizes  database  record information  to perform  search operations  quickly.
@ Desired information  can be searched  quickly  without  searching  all data if an index is used. The search speed does not
change  even if the number  of records  increases.
© The index is sorted by the column  value that has generated  the index and has the pointer  of the location  where the
actual values are stored in the table.
@ The most important  function  of the index is to speed up data search by reducing  the access  path.
B) Index design  procedure
@ An index should be selected  based on a comprehensive  judgment  after collecting  all access paths to the table and
analyzing  the collected  results.
@ In general,  an index is designed  in the following  order.
* Collection  of access  paths.
+ Selection  of candidate  columns  based on the distribution  survey.
+ Decision  on the access  path.
+ Decision  on the column  combination  and order.
C) Types of index structures
@ Tree-based  index
@ Function-based  index
@ Bitmap  join index
@ Domain  index
04 View Design
A) Characteristics  of the database  view
@ A view  is a table that is virtually  created  by collecting  the desired  data only from one or more tables.
@ Repetitive  data manipulation  can be performed  efficiently  by defining  frequently  used queries  in advance.
© Users can focus exclusively  on the data they are interested  in.
@A view  can show calculated  or derived  information.
@©A view  can limit the data that users can see.
