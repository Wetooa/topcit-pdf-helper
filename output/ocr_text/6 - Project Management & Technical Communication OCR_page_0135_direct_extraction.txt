If the project evaluation  criteria are successfully  met within the planned schedule and budget, the
project is evaluated  as a success,  However,  the Sydney Opera House runs counter  to such idea.
The construction  project,  which started with the groundbreaking  ceremony  in 1958, was delayed
leading to additional  costs increasing  exponentially.  The duration  got 6 years longer than originally
planned,  and the cost was 15 times higher than the original budget.  A project  with the construction
duration  and cost increased  significantly  compared  to the original plan is a failure in terms of project
management.  But what about now? More than 100  million tourists  visit the venue each year, earning
several times more profit the total construction  cost, and it has even been designated  as the World
Heritage  Site as a modern  building.
In business,  project performance  and evaluation  are based on compliance  with scope, schedule,
and cost, but even if the project fails to accomplish  the original plan, it may not be necessarily  a
failure, given the potential  value of the completed  project. In other words, it is necessary  to make
transparent  and reliable  decisions  about changes  in range, cost, and schedule.
01 Understanding  of Project  Management  System
A) Project  management  system,  PMS
Management  of a large-scale  enterprise-wide  project requires  a lot of human and physical input. The proj-
ect manager  manages  the project by connecting  it with some practical  software  for management  efficiency.
There is software  that automatically  manages  progress  for project  management.  When each project team
member  puts in their own project activity completion rate, the overall project progress  is managed  through
Excel, Project  Management  System (PMS), etc. PMS is a system  that manages  the entire process  from project
creation  to completion,  providing  efficiency  and transparency  in project management,  removing  risk factors,
and managing  schedule.
The most common  open source tools include Redmine,  Gantt Project, and Open Project.
