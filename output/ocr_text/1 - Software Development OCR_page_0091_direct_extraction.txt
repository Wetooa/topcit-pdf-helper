01 Programming Language  Overview
A) Concept  of the programming  language
A programming  language  enables  users to write a program  using a familiar  language,  that is, a language  that is
similar to the language  they use every day. In other words, programming  languages should be used to enable
humans  to communicate  with computers.  Thus, programs  written  in each programming  language  are translated
into machine  language  using a compiler  or an interpreter,  so that computers  can understand  the languages.
In addition,  it is necessary  to secure the productivity  and quality  goals using a proper programming  language  in
each area, because  each programming  language  has different  uses.
<Table 21> Low-level  language  and high-level  language
Item Description Representative  language
Low-level  languageMachine-centric  language  that is executed  quickly  and has a
different  code for each machine.
There is a machine  language  composed  of a binary system
that is easily understood  by the computer,  and an assembly
language  that corresponds  to the machine  language.
There is no compatibility  between  computer  models.Machine  language,
assembly  language
High-level  languageIt is easy to write a program  that is highly readable  and
productive  compared  to low-level  language  because  it is made
so as to be similar  to natural language,  which can be easily
understood  by humans.
A program  can be written independently  of the machine  and
converted  into low-level  language  by a compiler  or interpreter.FORTRAN,  COBOL,  BASIC, C, C,
Java, Python
The machine  language  is written in only 0 and 1 and can be directly understood  by hardware,  whereas  the
assembly language  expresses  the machine  language  in simple characters.  Both the machine language  and
assembly  language  are referred  to as a “low-level  language’.  However,  as it is practically  difficult for humans  to
manually  write programs  in either machine  language  or assembly  language,  high-level  languages  were created
to resolve this problem.  High-level  languages,  represented  by C, C++, Java, and Python, enable us to write
programs  using everyday  languages  and symbols.
