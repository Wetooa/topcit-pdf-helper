Software  Development )
- Supports  program  logic and the backend  binding  function,  and is not a simple static  web page.
@ Reacts
React is a JavaScript  library created  by Facebook  to develop  the Facebook  web. Like Backbone,js  and Angular,
React provides  a web front framework  needed for developing  an app. React is useful when building  a large-
scale application  that changes  web pages frequently.
+ Key features  of React
- Supports  the writing  of the markup  code in JavaScript  using extended  JavaScript  syntax,  which enables  the
existing  XML called JSX (JavaScript  XML).
- Supports  components  in individual  view units that constitute  the user interface.
- Allows  data processing  using the Virtual DOM.
@ Express,s
Express  is the web application  framework  of Nodejs,  which is small and flexible and provides  optimal  features
needed to develop  a web or application.  Express  supports  fast web development  for Node  js.
Node js is a back-end  server development  language  based on events, which uses the JavaScript  engine of
Google’s  Chrome  V8.
+ Key features  of Express
- Enables processing  of the dynamic  view of HTML pages depending  on the parameters  passed to the
template.
- Combines  necessary  functions  only by supporting  a middleware  structure  written  in JavaScript  code.
B) Technology  trends  of software  architecture
@ Microservice  architecture
The microservice  architecture  allows  independent  development,  build, test, deployment,  monitoring,  routing,
and extension  for each service, by dividing  one large application  into several small services  and creating  an
individual  data repository,  and by creating  an independent  execution  environment.
Prompt  response  to rapid business  changes,  deployment  within a short period of time, easy improvement  and
modification  are all possible.
+ Key features  of the microservice  architecture
- Development  productivity  is high as a service is divided into small units and developed  independently.
- Flexible  deployment  in units rather  than deployment  of the whole set.
- Asystem  can be expanded  elaborately  by expanding  the units independently.
@ Docker
Docker is an open-source  platform  that automates  the Linux container  (LXC) technology,  which provides
an independent  and isolated space like a virtual machine,  for ease of use. A company  called Dot Cloud
(now Docker) has started providing  technical  support  for the first time, while Google is preparing  Docker
configuration  for enterprises  by implementing  an open source project  called “Kubernetes”.
