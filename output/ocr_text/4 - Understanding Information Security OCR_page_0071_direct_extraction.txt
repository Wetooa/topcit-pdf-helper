C) CWE(Common  Weakness  Enumeration)
CWE is a classification  system  that MITRE, which is an affiliate of the U.S. Department  of Defense  with the
support  of the National  Cyber Security  Division  within the Department  of Homeland  Security,  classifies
software  weakness  items, based on the view, category, vulnerability,  and complex  elements.  (http://cwe.mitre.
org)
D) CWSS (Common  Weakness  Scoring  System)
CWSS is a scoring system for determining  the relative importance  of various vulnerabilities  in architecture,
design, code, or implementation  in software,  which can be important  security  issues of software.
E) CVE (Common  Vulnerabilities  and Exposures)
While CWE is a classification  system for common  vulnerabilities,  CVE is a list of security  vulnerabilities
discovered  over time. It can be seen as a record history of discovered  security  vulnerabilities,  managed  by the
identification system  of “CVE-Year-Sequence’”.
F) CVSS (Common  Vulnerabilities  Scoring  System)
CVSS is an open framework  used to assess and identify security vulnerabilities.  It consists  of three metric
groups: basic metric group, temporary  metric group, and environmental  metric group. The result, calculated  by
the three metric  groups,  becomes  the overall score of the vulnerability  and the priority  of the vulnerability.
