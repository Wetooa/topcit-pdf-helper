C) Considerations  when utilizing  the open-source  software  license
Individual  enterprises  should clearly understand  the advantages  and disadvantages  of using open-source
software  before using an open-source  software  license.
The major advantages  are as follows:
+ The initial development  cost is low because  the source code can be downloaded  from the web, and modified
and redistributed  free of charge.
+ Technology  can be developed  quickly and flexibly  as the latest technical  information,  problems,  and solutions
are shared between  communities.
+ Interoperability  between  different  software  is guaranteed  because  the open format or protocol  are mainly
used.
* Open source programs  are relatively  stable compare  to proprietary  programs  because many outstanding
developers  are participating  in development.
The major disadvantages  are as follows:
+ Documents  are not as systematic  as those of commercial  programs.
* The development  roadmap  is not systematic  because  the source code is developed  on the web freely based
on voluntary  participation.  To utilize open-source  software,  the future development  plan of the software
concerned  needs to be considered.
+ Generally,  it is required  that open-source  software  should be distributed  without  a patent royalty.
