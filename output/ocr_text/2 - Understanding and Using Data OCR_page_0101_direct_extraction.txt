Relational  algebra is a set of operations  for processing  relations  in a relational  database  and has the
characteristic  that all operands  of each operation  are relations,  and the result of the operation  is also
relations.  Basic relational  algebra  operations  are usually divided into set operations  and relation  operations.
Exact understanding  of relational  algebra operations  is required to use the relational  database  efficiently
using a language  such as SQL.

Most relational  databases  used by the information  systems  of enterprises  and organizations  use SQL as
the standard  query language.  If an SQL statement  is written without  understanding  relational  algebra,
which is the theoretical  basis of SQL, the SQL statement  cannot  retrieve  the result intended  by the user,
and may degrade  performance.  Therefore,  users should fully understand  relational  algebra before writing a
more optimized  SQL statement.
