<Table 46> Cost Estimation  Method
Cost Estimation
TechniqueCharacteristics  and Explanation
Analogous  Estimating+ Amethod  of estimating  the cost of the current  project  based on the scope, cost, budget,
and duration  of similar projects  in the past
Bottom-up  Estimating+ Amethod  of estimating  the sum of the lowest-level  work packages  to come up with upper-
level cost
+ It is affected  by the size and complexity  of an individual  activity  or work package  and time-
consuming  but enables  accurate  cost estimation.
Expert  Judgment+ Amethod  of presenting  information  about the project  including  labor costs, raw materials
costs, inflation  and risk factors,  based on the surrounding  environment  and information  about
previous  similar projects
Three-point  Estimating
C) Budgeting+ Amethod  of estimating  project  cost using the most likely, optimistic,  and pessimistic  values.
It takes into account  uncertainty  and risk in cost estimation.
It is a process’  of creating  an approved  cost baseline  by collecting  individual  activities  and work packages  of
cost estimation,  or estimated  costs, in order to manage  all costs in an integrated  manner. The cost baseline
is the approved  version  of the project  budget,  excluding  management  reserves.  After all, the project  budget  is
the sum of the management  reserves  and the cost baseline.
Contingency  reserves,  used in case of contingencies  other than planned  activities  by project  managers,  are in-
cluded in the cost baseline.  However,  management  reserves  are an expense  that can be enforced  by the Chief
Technical  Officer  (CTO), sponsor,  or CEO.
D) Cost control
Project  cost control is a process  of monitoring  the status of project  cost management  and baseline  changes.
