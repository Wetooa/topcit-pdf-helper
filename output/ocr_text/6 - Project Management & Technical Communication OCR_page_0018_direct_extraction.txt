Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
The key elements  of business  communication  are the information  to be shared,  the sender  and receiver  of the
information,  and the medium  for information  sharing, like for any other form of communication.  In addition,  in
order for the sender  to include  information  in the medium,  an encoding  process  is required,  and in order for the
receiver  to obtain information  from the medium,  a decoding  process  is required.  During this process,  noise may
inevitably  occur from all elements  of the sender, encoding,  medium,  decoding,  and receiver.  Therefore,  in the
process  of performing  business  communication,  a feedback  process  is essential  to minimize  noise and confirm
whether  clear information  is received.
