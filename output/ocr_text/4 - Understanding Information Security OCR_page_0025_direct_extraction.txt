@ Cryptographic  protocols
Cryptographic  protocols  refer to the protocols  that use cryptographic  techniques.  As a protocol  means a series
of finite phases in which more than 2 persons participate  to achieve a certain purpose,  the cryptographic
protocol  should prevent repudiation  by  a participant,  or a third party, to ensure a certain purpose  of the
concerned  cryptographic  protocol  (authentication,  confidentiality,  integrity,  and non-repudiation,  etc.), as well
as the meaning  of each message.

® Cryptographic  algorithm
The cryptographic  algorithm  that uses an encryption  key can be described  as [Figure 5]. In the figure, P is plain
text, E is the cryptographic  function,  and K(KE, KD) is the key value. As in the public key method,  the encryption
key and the decryption  key can be different.  In that case, keys are expressed  KE and KD respectively.  Since
ciphertext  is generally  transmitted  over the communication  line or network  that is not secure, the sender  and
receiver  can ensure  confidentiality  by transmitting  the result of encrypting  the plaintext.
