A) Overview  of access  control
@® Concept  of access  control
Access control refers to the task of controlling  who can access a system,  and which task the user can perform
when the user interacts  with the system. Specifically,  access control consists  of three parts: identification,
authentication,  and authorization.
+ Identification
A process  of identifying  a subject using its unique token, that is, a process  where the system identifies  the
subject.  (e.g., ID, employee  card, biometrics)
+ Authentication
A process  where the subject verifies its identity  to the system,  that is, a process  where the system
acknowledges  the user who claims his/her  identity  (e.g., password  (knowledge-based),  certificate  (ownership-
based), OTP (ownership-based),  biometrics  (presence-based)).
+ Authorization
A process  when the system controls  the task and object, which can be performed  and accessed  by the
authenticated  user (e.g., mandatory  access control, discretionary  access control, role-based  access control).

An object can be accessed  only when the right to access is obtained  through  the authorization process  after
