Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
It is difficult  to judge the value of work that has already been completed  or has not begun at the time
of performance  measurement.  However,  measuring  the value of work in progress may be less inaccurate
depending  on the criteria.  The value of the work in progress  can be measured  by choosing  one of the following
methods:
+ Percent  Complete
The amount  of completed  work against  the planned  budget  at completion
Example)  40% Complete  — 40% of the budget  claimed  as EV
+ 50/50 Rule
A task is considered  50% complete  when it starts. The remaining  50% credit is given when the task is
completed.
Example)  The work in progress  — 50% of the allocated  budget  claimed  as EV
+ 20/80 Rule
A task is considered  20% complete  when it starts. The remaining 80% credit is given when the task is
completed.
Example)  The work in progress  — 20% of the budget  claimed  as EV
+ 0/100 Rule
A task obtains  0% credit when the activity  begins and 100% credit when the task is completed.
Example)  The work in progress  — No EV claimed
