@ Ethical Issues of Artificial  Intelligence(Al)
The emergence  of intelligent  robots and the phenomenon  of intelligentization  of products  and services  led to the
transition  to an intelligent  information  society  while ushering  in the era of the 4th industrial  revolution.  Ethical issues
in artificial intelligence  and robot technology  are largely divided into moral and philosophical  ethics for the identity
of Al(robots)  and its relationship  with humans,  and practical  ethics required  of professionals  who participate  in the
development  and use of artificial  intelligence  which is distributed  to consumers.
The following  major announcements  have been made regarding  Al ethics.
+ In 2010, UK EPSRC (Engineering  & Physical  Sciences  Research  Council)  presented  Principles  of Robots: Present  all Al
issues from the perspective  of designers,  builders,  and users.
+ In October  2016, the NSTC (National  Science  and Technology  Commission)  published  an Al report titled “Preparing
‘or the future of artificial intelligence’  : Emphasize  the role of state in developing  artificial intelligence  as an
important  economic  growth engine, Form a national  and social consensus  on future issues that may arise from Al.
+ In December  2016, the IEEE (Institute  of Electrical  and Electronics  Engineers)  announced  “Ethically  Aligned Design”:
Emphasize  to design by taking into account  ethical aspects  from the beginning  of developing  artificial intelligence
and automatic  systems.  Deal with accountability  that should be held by suppliers  and suppliers,  transparency,
awareness-raising,  personal  information  protection,  employment  issues, etc.
+ In December  2016, the Japanese  Ministry  of Internal  Affairs and Communications  announced  “Proposal  of Discussion
toward Formulation  of Al R&D Guideline”:  Present  eight major principles  that Al developers  must comply with,
including  transparency,  user support,  controllability,  security, safety protection,  personal information  protection,
ethics, accountability,  etc.
+ In January  2017, FLI (Future of Life Institute)  in the U.S. announced  “Asilomar  Al Principles”  : signed on 23 principles
to adhere to when developing  artificial intelligence.  More than 2,000 Al scholars,  futurists,  and industry,  academia,
and research  associates  signed the keywords  of Al ethics such as safety, transparency,  accountability,  privacy
protection,  sharing  of profits, and prevention  of Al arms race.
+ In February  2017, the European  Union (EU) released  the “Civil Law Rules on Robotics”:  Advise  all developers,
researchers,  and designers  involved in robot development  to prioritize  human dignity when planning,  designing,  and
implementing  robots, respect  personal  privacy, and put human safety  first.
Some argue that Al developers  as individuals  or companies  who are planning  and designing  artificial  intelligence  (robots)
41 The seven topics presented  in the report are as follows.
@Applications  of Al for Public Good, @ Al in the federal Government  © Al and regulation,  @ Research  and Workforce,  © Al,
Automation,  and the Economy  © Fairness,  Safety, and Governance  @ Global
Considerations  and Security
42 This principle  is evaluated  as proposing  an international  norm for the principles  for the development  and use of artificial  intelligence.
It was designed  by Al engineers,  futurists,  and Al-related industry-academia-research  officials including  physicist  Stephen  Hawking,
Google  Deep Mind CEO Demis Hassabis,  futurist  Ray Kurzweil,  and Tesla Motors  CEO Elon Musk.
