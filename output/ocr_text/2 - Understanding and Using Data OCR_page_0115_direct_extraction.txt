general SQL statement  can retum multiple  tuples as an execution  result, whereas  an embedded  SQL statement  can
return only one tuple.
@ The tuple returned  by the embedded  SQL statement  can be stored using a common  variable.
© The embedded  SQL statement  is separated  and compiled  by a preprocessor  when the host program  is compiled.

@ The host program  variable  and the database  field can have the same name.
© The data type of the host program  variable  should match that of the corresponding  database  field.
© The execution  result, such as success,  failure, or error, is passed as a string (or integer)  value using an implicit SQL
state variable  called SQLCODE.
C) Embedded  SQL cursor
Cursor indicates  a pointer  to the tuples of the table that are returned  as the result of executing  an embedded  SQL
statement.  Multiple tuples, which can be returned  as the result of executing  an embedded  SQL statement,  can be
accessed  using cursor.  The main statements  used to operate  cursor  are as follows.
@ Declare:  A statement  for declaration  related to cursor, such as cursor definition.
@ OPEN: A statement  used to set cursor  to point to the first tuple of the query result.
@ FETCH:  A statement  used to move cursor  to the next tuple among  the tuples of the query result.
@® CLOSE:  A statement  used to close cursor  upon completing  the processing  of the query execution  result.
