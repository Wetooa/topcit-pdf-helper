Software  Development )
+ Inheritance  and reusability  aspects:  C++ has reusability  using inheritance.  “Inheritance”  refers to the process
of creating a new class by re-creating  the common  characteristics  of several classes as a single class and
extending  it. Program  reusability  can be increased,  and software  productivity  can be enhanced  by using
inheritance.
+ Polymorphic  aspect: Polymorphism  means that several forms have one name. For example,  a person  named
“Hong Gildong”  is an office worker  who works hard at work but is also an instructor  who gives lectures  at an
evening  academy.
C) Java language
@ Introduction  to the Java language
James Gosling began developing  Java at Sun Microsystems  from 1991 as a simple, bug-free  programming
language  to control home appliances.  Development  started with the C++ language  in the initial stages. Even
though it improved  several problems  of C++, home appliance  companies  did not pay much attention  to it.
However,  the powerful  output  form called “applet”  gained popularity  as Java was applied to the Interest  by Hot
Java owing to the rapid spread of Internet  penetration.  The advantages  of the Java language  were recognized
because  its small and simple structure  enabled  efficient  change and execution,  and because  it improved  upon
several  functions  that caused errors in existing  languages.  Currently,  Java has become  the most popular,  widely
used programming  language  for apps and mobile devices,  and is used to create apps for home appliances  and
Android  devices.
@ Characteristics  of the Java language
+ Java is grammatically  similar  to the C/C++ language  because  it derives  from the C++ language.
+ The complexity  of C++ has been simplified.
+ Automatic  garbage  collection  is always performed.
+ Object-oriented  language:  Perfect  object-oriented  language  that applies  the concept  of an object.
+ It is independent  from the platform  as the Java program  is executed  by the Java virtual machine.
D) Python  language
@ Introduction  to the Python  language
Python is an interpreter  language  developed  by Guido Van Rossum  in 1990. This object-oriented,  conversational
language  uses frequently  used English keywords  for high readability  and productivity.  Python is mainly used as
a web programming  language  based on Django, a web framework  based on open source. Recently,  it has been
widely used in big data analysis  and the development  of artificial  intelligence  programs.
@ Characteristics  of the Python language
+ The data type is checked  at runtime  using dynamic  typing.
+ It is easy to use as grammar  is easy and similar to English sentences.
+ Advantageous  to asynchronous  coding using a single  event loop
+ Multi-paradigm  programming  language  (supporting  procedural  languages,  functional  programming  languages,
and object-oriented  programming).
