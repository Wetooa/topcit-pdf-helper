Information  security )
+ Application  of secure coding
Secure coding should be applied to prevent security  vulnerabilities  that may exist from the source code
implementation  phase, regardless  of the loT device. Software  developed  in Java and C/C++ should utilize
secure coding  guides prepared  in advance.  Languages  without  a guide must verify the security  quality  of the
source code, based on international  standards,  and must use a separate  analysis  tool and methodology.
+ Verifying  software  security
When using various software  to improve  the productivity  and quality of products  and services  during loT
product  and service development,  security  measures  against  the presently  known security vulnerabilities
should be verified, and security  patches  must be applied. The guideline  procedure should be performed  to
verify the countermeasures  against known security  vulnerabilities,  and the known vulnerabilities  should be
searched  and responded  to using reference  sites.
+ Using secure hardware  devices
loT devices require various levels of security  strength,  depending  on the type of application  service. loT
devices have various hardware  security  vulnerabilities,  such as the side channel attack, firmware  code
extraction,  and key value extraction,  because  those devices are mainly installed  in the environment  that can
easily be exposed  to attackers.  For this reason, various hardware  security  techniques,  such as firmware/code
encryption,  execution  code domain control, and reverse engineering  prevention  techniques,  should be used
to strengthen  hardware  security.  It is necessary  to appropriately  apply these techniques according  to the
application  environment  of the loT device.
+ Converging  software  security  technology  and hardware  security  technology
When converging  software  security  technology  and hardware  security  technology,  confidentiality  and
integrity  functions  should be provided  for the transmitted  data, by establishing  a safe secure channel
between  software  security  technology,  and hardware  security  technology,  based on a trusted approach  (one-
way and two-way  authentication).
@® Security  by system component  to provide loT services
+ loT network
Security  requirements  that are suitable  for the communication/network  access protocol,  mainly used by the
loT service, should be applied.
+ Dedicated  loT protocol
Security  vulnerabilities  need to be eliminated  when linking between  protocols.  The security  requirement  for
the data transmission  protocol  that is standardized  by the loT standard  organization,  should be applied.
+ loT platform
The loT platform  security  requirements,  defined  by the proven standard  organization,  should be applied.
+ Service  model
Various security  requirements  and legal/regulatory  matters,  related to security,  should be applied for
