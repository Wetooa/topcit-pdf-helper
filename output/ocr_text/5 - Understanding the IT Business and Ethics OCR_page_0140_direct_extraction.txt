+ Characteristics  of Open API
- Using the open API, people can gain access  to the functions  of a website.
- New service  can be designed  by connecting  several APIs.
- Key factor in the emergence  of mashup  sites? .
- People  who were  just users of a service  can become  service providers.
<Table69>Component  elements  of Open API
Category Description
What could be Open API Service  that an API provides  to users (weather,  traffic, public information,  map, etc.)
Server: XML, SOAP, Blooging  API
How to ‘open’ an API Ciient: XML, Javascript,  DOM, XML Http Request, AJAX, etc.
+ REST (Representational  State Transfer)  API
REST API is currently  the most widely used Open API.
REST API is a network-based  architecture  published  in 2000 by Roy Fielding,  one of HTTP's leading authors, to
properly  utilize the superiority  of the Web (HTTP). REST is a web service architecture  based on the Resource
Oriented  Architecture  (ROA) and it is composed  of HTTP URI + HTTP Method.  HTTP URI is used to specify  the target
resource,  and the designation  of actions  for that resource  utilizes the HTTP Method.

B) Mobile service
@ Location  Based Service
Location-based  services  are growing  together  with the smartphone  market, which has seen exponential  growth
since 2010, and are evolving  into a broad category  of services  by merging  location information,  commerce,  and
entertainment.  Due to the mobile Big Bang, the availability  of location  detection  capable  devices greatly increased
and the location  determination  platform  became  open. This led to the rapid evolution  of location-based  services  (LBS)
In the case of location  detection  mechanism  used in smartphones,  location  detection  technologies  like base stations
Cell-ID, GPS, and Wi-Fi were combined  with motion sensor-based  precision  guess navigation.  Furthermore,  by
adopting  maps like Google Map and Apple Map, location-based  services  began to be used for many general purposes.
9 Mashup site -Websites  that use APIs for product  information,  map information,  etc. from Microsoft,  Google, Yahoo, Amazon,  and
others and combines  them with their own user interfaces  to come up with new services.
