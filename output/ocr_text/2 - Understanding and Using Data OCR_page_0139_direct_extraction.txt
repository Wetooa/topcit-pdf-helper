01 Concept  and Characteristics  of the Data Warehouse  (DU).
A) Concept  of the data warehouse
A data warehouse  is an integrated  system or database  that enables  the user to instantly  analyze internal data
and external data generated  by the operation  system of an enterprise  over time, without  the need for separate
programming  from multiple  points of view, by integrating  data by subject.
B) Characteristics  of the data warehouse
Unlike the data repository  of OLTP for OLTP systems,  the data warehouse  generally  has the following  characteristics.
<Table  60> Characteristics  of the data warehouse
Characteristics Description
Subject-oriented+ Among  the multiple  types of operation  system  data that are managed  by data business
functions,  the data of a specific  subject  needed  for decision-making  activities  from an enterprise
perspective  is saved, while other data are not included.
Integrated+ The structure  of a data warehouse  is characterized  by data consistency  and physical  unity
through  company-wide  data standardization.
+ When obtaining  data from the operation  system,  a series of data conversion  tasks are performed
to integrate  the data.
Time variant+ To analyze  past and present  trends and forecast  the future, a data warehouse  retains  data for a
long time in the form of a series of snapshots.
+ Users can understand  the process  of data change  over time using the data history.
Non-volatile+ A data warehouse  is a read-only  database  that cannot  be deleted  or modified  once it has been
loaded from the operation  system  database.
+ When a modification  occurs  in the operation  system  data, existing  data are deleted.  The data in
the data warehouse  stores the history  of data at each point in time.
02 Data Warehouse  Modeling
A) Definition  of data warehouse  modeling
Unlike general ER modeling  for OLTP systems,  data warehouse  modeling  refers to a data modeling  technique  that,
from a data analysis perspective,  enables users to analyze large-scale  data from various  viewpoints.  Data are
generally  organized  into fact tables and dimension  tables so that end users or analysts  can easily analyze  information.
The table below shows  the main components  of data warehouse  modeling.
<Table 61> Components  of data warehouse  modeling
Item Description
+ Acore  table composed  of a set of highly relevant  measures.
Fact table + As measurement  data, a Measure  can observe  the goal of information  analysis,  such as
the amount,  number,  time, etc.
