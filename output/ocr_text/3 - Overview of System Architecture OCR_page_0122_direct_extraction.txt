expensive  external  storage.  As shown in [Figure 88], HCI groups the direct attached  storage  (DAS), which is located
under a general-purpose  x86 server, with the software-defined  storage  (SDS) technology  through  the IP-based
network  and uses it as a storage pool, similar to a storage  area network  (SAN). The architecture  eliminates  the
structural  complexity  and reduces  costs most of all by eliminating  external  storage.
