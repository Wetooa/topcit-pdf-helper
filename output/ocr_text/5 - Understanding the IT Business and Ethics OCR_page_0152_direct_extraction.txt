There is much news and interest  around the concept  of smart cities. A smart city can be defined as an "urban
model that can solve various urban problems  and improve  the quality of life in a city through  the adoption  of new
technologies  like ICT and Big Data."?
Smart cities are seen as an answer  to the problems  of aging infrastructures,  energy shortages,  environmental
pollution  and crime faced by cities around the world. To build such a smart city, the latest technologies  like Al, Big
Data, 5G mobile technologies  are employed  in the development  of “smart  traffic’, “smart  environment’,  “public safety’,
“public  welfare”  and “smart energy”  services.  Smart city concept  is the leading  example  of smart infrastructure.

@ Smart grid
Smart grid refers to a next-generation  power system that combines  IT technologies  with existing  power grids to
monitor  and control the supply & demand  of power supplies  in real time to match the production  and consumption
of electric  power. In traditional  power systems  the generation  of power is centralized  which means power producers
unilaterally  supply power to consumers.  Power plants are built to meet the estimated  maximum  consumption  level,
