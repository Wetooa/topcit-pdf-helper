+ Connected  car service
Connected  car is a core technology  of self-driving  cars whose development  has been driven by advances  made in
telematics  technology  made possible  by the development  of mobile communication  and cloud services.  Connected
cars can provide  services  like transportation  information  services,  music services  in cars, and information  services  to
car riders based on their connectivity  to other cars, surroundings,  and infrastructure.
Examples  of services  that connected  cars can provide include information  services  using augmented  reality, services
that help drivers by recognizing  and notifying  them about road conditions  ahead, and fully autonomous  driving and
automatic  parking  that do not require  any driver response.

Among  the social changes  brought  about by advanced  digital environment,  the changes  that could affect the
education  environment  are the increased  number  of couples  who decide to live together  without  tying the knot,
the continuously  declining  birth rate, the arrival of an age when individual  choices  are respected,  and the rapid aging
of the population.  To respond  to these societal changes,  the government  established  a national strategy  on smart
education  along with a basic plan on informatization  of education  in the country.

[Fig.72]  Concept  of smart  education
The government's  smart education  program  produced  a digital textbook  prototype  in 2006, based on basic research
that began in 1997. In 2007, the Ministry  of Education  developed  digital textbooks  for the teaching  of Korean, English,
and mathematics  and discussed  the commercial rollout. After that the ministry  announced  the "Smart Education
Promotion  Strategy"  in 2011 and is presently  pursuing  a smart education  program  under a new set of policies.
+ Smart classroom
Together  with the digital textbook,  smart  classroom  is the other important  pillar of smart education.  Smart classroom
is a new way of teaching  students  in a class room fitted with a projector,  TV, large smart liquid crystal displays,
electronic  blackboards  and wireless  Internet  devices. Teachers  who are people held responsible  for the quality of
education  can conduct  classes  using various programs  using digital devices  in digital classrooms.
