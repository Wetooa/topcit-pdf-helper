Database
>> Recent  trends and major issues
A database  has the property  that once it has been built, it should process  actual business  data stably.
However,  data can be corrupted  due to a certain problem  when they are digitalized  and saved. In this case,
it is vital to have a technology  that can restore  the database  stably. This chapter  explains  how to process  a
database  stably and the concept  and techniques  of backing  up and restoring  data.
The recent DBMS essentially  operates  database  backup policies for stable data processing.  In addition,
backup  methods  are also evolving  continuously  to enable rapid backup,  such as using the VTL (Virtual Tape
Library).
