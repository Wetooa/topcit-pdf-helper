Overview  of System  Architecture
>p> Recent  trends and issues
Merely ten years ago, nobody  could have imagined  web surfing, shopping,  or watching  movies in bed.
The introduction  of the smartphone  made these things possible,  as it was a computer  for your hand. A
smartphone  is also a computer  system  that runs on the OS. Most mobile  operating  systems  have recently
disappeared,  and iOS and Android have become  the two dominant  operating  systems  on the market.
These two operating  systems  are in a heated battle for the diversity  of functions  and user-friendliness.
Apple and Google,  who provide  these two operating  systems,  are two global enterprises  among  the top ten
global companies  in market  value. In the past, when smartphones  were unknown,  Microsoft,  who provided
operating  systems  for personal  computers,  and IBM, who provided  operating  systems  for servers,  such as
mainframes  and UNIX, were in the top ten companies  in the world in terms of market  value. The operating
system (OS) is the base platform  of a computer  system for providing  information  services.  Any company
that can monopolize  this platform  can gain tremendous  added value using this platform.  As such, the
essential  knowledge  for understanding  the system  architecture,  is the operating  system.
