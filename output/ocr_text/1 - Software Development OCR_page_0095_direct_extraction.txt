E) JavaScript  language
® Introduction  to the JavaScript  language
JavaScript  is an object-based  script programming  language  that is mainly used in the web browser. It includes  a
function  for accessing  the built-in objects  of other application  programs.  JavaScript  is also used for server-side
network  programming  such as the Node js runtime  environment.
@® Characteristics  of the JavaScript  language
+ Programming  is simple, but it may be vulnerable  to security.
+ Highly scalable  and useable due to active sharing among developers  because  it is operated  as an open
source,
+ Easy to learn because  no separate  compilation  process  is required.
+ Recently,  more and more developers  have started using libraries  and frameworks  related to JavaScript,  such
as Angularjs,  D3js, Nodejs,  and Reacts.
03 Software  Development  Framework
A) Concept  of the software  development  framework
A software  development  framework  is a set of code libraries,  interface  protocols,  and configuration  information,
all of which is used to develop  an information  system efficiently  and to provide the basic framework  for
software  composition.  This framework  is the representative  technology  to which the concept  of “Inversion  of
Control” (loC) is applied, and it enables developers  to complete  an application  by extending  the upper-level
application  functions  (business  logic, etc.)
That is, this framework  provides  an environment  in which developers  can create software  easily, by providing
structured  tools and libraries  for data display on the screen, a method of handling  data, and interfacing  with
external  modules,  instead  of developing  software  from scratch.
The software  development  framework  solves the problem  of integration  and consistency  that occurs while
developing  a set of classes  and interfaces  which can cooperate  with each other to solve the specific problem
of software,  and reduces  the coding work of developers  while increasing  their development  productivity.  The
framework  also standardizes  developers  upwards  to guarantee  a certain level of quality and reduce the risk of
new software  development  using proven technology.
The table below shows the advantages  of using the software  development  framework.
<Table 23> Advantages  of using the software  development  framework
Strengths Description
Defines  and handles  in advance  parts that can be written  incorrectly  during repetitive  coding
work, thus improving  code quality  by minimizing  the risk of bugs when writing  codes.
Maximizes  development  productivity  by providing  various  functions  necessary  for development
in advance,  such as components,  communication  processing  methods,  and data handling
methods,  etc.Improves  code quality
Increases  development
productivity
