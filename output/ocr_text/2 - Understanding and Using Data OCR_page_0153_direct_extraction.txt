E) Characteristics  of the NoSQL  data model
@ Definition  of tIhe CAP theoremcan be easily processed  by the program  is created
- This theory asserts that  as it is impossible  for a distributed  data store to simultaneously  satisfy all of data
consistency,  availability,  and partition  tolerance,  only two should be strategically  selected.
