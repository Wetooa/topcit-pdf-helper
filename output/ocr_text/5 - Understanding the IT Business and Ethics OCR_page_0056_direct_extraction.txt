The adoption  of an IT business  must be executed  in alignment  with a company’s  IT business  strategy  and plans.
Methods  and procedures  of IT business  adoption  must be created  in accordance  with the size of the organization  and
changes  in the external  environment  of the company.  The outsourcing  of IT services  should be considered  for the

adoption  must follow the standard  procedures  defined in ISO/IEC 12207.
