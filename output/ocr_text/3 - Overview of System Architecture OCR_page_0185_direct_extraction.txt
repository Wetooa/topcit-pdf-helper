@ TCP connection  setting
The basic way to establish  a TCP connection  is with a three-way  handshake  procedure.  This procedure  begins by
sending  an SYN segment  with a sequence  number  (SEQ) 100, from one TCP endpoint,  to another  TCP end, as shown
in the second step of [Figure 132]. The SYN segment  means that the SYN control flag of the TCP header is set to 1.
The ACK segment  means that the ACK control  flag is set to 1. The SYN and ACK segments  mean that both the SYN
control  flag and the ACK control  flag are set to 1.
Upon receiving  the SYN segment,  TCP B sets the SYN control flag (SEQ=300),  requesting  connection  establishment
with TCP A from TCP B, along with acknowledgment  number  (ACK) 101'°, and sends the SYN and ACK segments,  as
shown in step 3 in [Figure 132]. Upon receiving  it, TCP A confirms  the ACK control  flag and ACK=101  to recognize  that
the connection  request  has been properly  delivered.
The SYN control flag set together  indicates that TCP B sent the connection  request.  The three-way  handshake  is
complete  when the ACK segment  (ACK=301)  is sent to TCP B, and the bidirectional  connection,  between  TCP A and
TCP B, is established.
As described  above, the three-way  handshake  for TCP connection  confirms  that the SYN segment,  the SYN and ACK
segment,  and the ACK segment  are transferred  between  TCP terminals.  At the same time, the sequence  number  (SEQ)
that is transferred  between  TCP terminals  plays an important  role in flow and error controls  to check whether  the
data streams  are transferred  properly  in byte units.
TCP  A TCP  B
1, CLOSED LISTEN
2, SYN-SENT — (SEQ=100)(CTL=SYN) =- SYN-RECEIVED
3, ESTABLISHED  — (SEQ=300)(ACK=101)(CTL=SYN,ACK)  -  — SYN-RECEIVED
4, ESTABLISHED  > — <SEQ=101)(ACK=301)(CTL=ACK)  => ESTABLISHED
5, ESTABLISHED  — (SEQ=101)(ACK=301){CTL=ACK)(DATA)  — ESTABLISHED

TCP manages  connection  by allocating  a system  resource,  TCB (Transmission  Control Block), upon receiving  the SYN
segment  for connection.  If a large number  of SYN segments  are sent in a short time for malicious  purposes,  the TCP
end-host  that has received  it may not be able to allocate  any more TCBs, resulting  in the service being unavailable.
This attack is called SYN flooding,  and it can be referred  to as a type of denial-of-service  attack.
10 According  to the TCP flow control method,  the next desired byte sequence  number  101 is sent as the acknowledgment  number.
