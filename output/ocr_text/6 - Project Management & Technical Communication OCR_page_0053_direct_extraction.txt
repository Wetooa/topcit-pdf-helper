G) Design brief
The design brief is a document  that implements  the requirements  described  based on the analysis  specifying
detailed  requirements  for designing  or manufacturing  a SW product.  Therefore,  it includes  structural  design to
understand  the configuration  of SW and the relationship  between  programs,  interface  design between  mod-
ules or systems,  design of data storage  to store data, design of program  algorithm,  and design of user inter-
face,
<Table 17> Composition  of Design Brief (example)
Classification Content
1. General  information + Definition and overview
2. Structure  design« SW components
+ Relationship  between  SW components
3. Program  design+ Algorithm  design of SW components
+ Input and output  design of SW components
4. Interface  design+ Overview  of related SW components
+ Interface  between  SW components
5. Material  design
H) Test design brief+ Data storage  overview
+ Data storage  design
In order to test an implemented  product,  it is necessary  to define test targets and clearly understand  the re-
sult values such as normal results and exception  results during the test.
The test design brief is a document  created to be used for testing by defining  test objects, test cases, and
test data.
