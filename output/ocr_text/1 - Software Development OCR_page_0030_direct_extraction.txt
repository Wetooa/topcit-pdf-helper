Scrum  teamGenerally,  a Scrum team is composed  of five to nine members.  The Scrum team identifies  the
functions  to be developed  during  a sprint using user stories.
@ Scrum process
The Scrum process  has the following  three components.
+ Sprint: Sprint refers to the repetitive  development  period in units of 1 to 4 weeks by the calendar.
+ Three meetings:  Daily Scrum, Sprint plan, Sprint review
+ Three deliverables:  Product  backlog,  Sprint backlog,  Burndown  chart
The three deliverables  can be summarized  as shown in <Table 4>.

Product  backlog
Sprint backlog
Burndown  chartDescription
The product  backlog  is a breakdown  of work to be done, and the product  manager  mainly
determines  the priority  on behalf  of the customer.  The function  defined  in the product  backlog  is
called user story. The standard  called ‘story point’ is mainly used to estimate  the user’s workload.
A list of works to be developed  during a sprint. The user story and the work required  to complete  it
are defined  as a task. The size of each task is estimated  by the hour.
The sprint burndown  chart shows remaining  work in the sprint backlog.  The chart shows remaining
work for each iteration  as a story point.
The three deliverables  of the Scrum process  can be summarized  as shown in <Table 5>.

Sprint planning
Daily Scrum
Sprint  reviewDescription
Goals are set for each sprint and items are selected  for execution  during  a sprint from the
product  backlog.  A person  is appointed  to take charge  of each item and draw up a plan for each
task.
A meeting  that is held for 15 minutes  each day to share the progress  of the project.  All of the
team members  should attend and discuss  what they did, what to do and other issues every day.
A meeting  held to check the work progress  and deliverables  in order to see if the sprint goal has
been achieved.  The Scrum team demonstrates  what they did during  the sprint to the attendees
and receives  their feedback.  It is recommended  to run a demo for all works performed  during  the
sprint concerned  with the participation  of the customer.  At this time, the Scrum master  conducts
a retrospective  review  to find out what went well, what was disappointing,  and what should be
improved  upon during  the sprint.
@ Characteristics  of Scrum
Scrum has the following  characteristics.
+ Transparency:  It is difficult  to exactly understand  the current status of the project, progress  compared  to
the plan, and identified  issues. Scrum enables  the user to effectively  understand  the status or problem  of a
project  using various  techniques,  such as the Scrum meeting,  burndown  chart, and sprint review.
* Timeboxing:  Concentration on a project only becomes  possible  by limiting the amount  of time it takes to
implement  Scrum. The daily Scrum is performed  for a limited time of 15 minutes  each day, and the sprint
review is performed  periodically  for each iteration.
* Communication:  Much effort is made during Scrum to facilitate  communication  among the team members.
One of the characteristics  of Scrum that makes communication  among team members  smooth is the
procedure  by which developers  share their problems  during the daily Scrum and discuss  the difficulty/time  of
