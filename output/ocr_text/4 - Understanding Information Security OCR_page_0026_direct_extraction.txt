The receiver  tries to send plaintext  P, which can be seen by anyone,  to the other party. The sender  generates
ciphertext  C from plaintext  P using the encryption  key KE and the cryptographic  algorithm  E,then delivers  it to
the receiver.  In general,  we cannot  understand  ciphertext  C without  knowing  the decryption  key, which is called
computational  impossibility.  Here, the computational  impossibility  means that we can understand  the contents
of the plaintext,  even though  we don’t know the decryption  key, if infinite time is used. The attacker  attempts
to understand  the contents  of the plaintext  using various methods.  The legitimate  receiver  can understand
plain text P that the sender has initially intended  to send, by receiving  ciphertext  C sent by the sender and
converting  it using the decryption  key KD and decryption  algorithm  D.
@ Cryptosystem
All the elements  that are needed  for a series of encryption  and decryption  processes  are called a “cryptosystem”.
The cryptosystem  should generally  meet the following  requirements:
+ Encryption  and decryption  should be effectively  performed  by the encryption  key.
+ A cryptosystem  should be easy to use.
+ Security  should be performed  by the encryption  key, rather  than by a cryptographic  algorithm.
E) Private key encryption  and public key cryptographic  algorithm
@ Private key cryptographic  algorithm
The secret key encryption  algorithm  has the advantage  that the encryption  key used for encryption  and the
decryption  key used for decryption  are the same, and that the length of the key may be short, and the speed
of encryption  and decryption  operations  is fast.

However,  it is difficult to share the key if the distance  between  the sender  and the receiver  is long. If there are
many other parties who require encrypted  communication,  it is quite burdensome  to generate  and maintain
different  keys. It is called a private key encryption  system, in the sense that the key should be kept and
managed  in secret.It  is also called a conventional  encryption  system,  in the sense that it is commonly  used.
The private key encryption  system is still widely used, even though it is difficult  to share the key, because
the cryptographic  algorithm  is composed  of a combination  of substitution  and transposition,  enabling  fast
operations.  In addition,  this system is divided into the block cipher and the stream cipher, as shown in Table 2,
depending  on the plaintext  processing  method.
