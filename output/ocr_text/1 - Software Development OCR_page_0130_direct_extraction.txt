XIll. Trends  of Open-Source  Software
>> Recent  trends and major issues
The recent trend of software  development  is focused on the conviction  that a company’s
competitiveness  depends  on how quickly it develops  and releases  software  on the market. In this
respect,  time to service, not time to market, is becoming  a key factor. A quick response  using a
development  methodology  that is reliant on proprietary  software  is not possible  in this environment.
As a result, software  development  and the necessity  of using open-source  software  are increasing  as
several  technologies  can be used.
1. To be able to explain the concept  and license  of open-source  software.
2. To be able to understand  and use open-source  software  licenses.
