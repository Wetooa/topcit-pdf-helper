Modern society had passed the Big Data 1.0 era, when the quantitative  explosion  of big data began and
entered  the Big Data 2.0 era, which creates  practical  values from big data.
The introduction  of Hadoop  2.2 has made big data technology  more sophisticated  and diversified  the
professional  services  of the big data vendors  from the big data supply aspect, leading  to the emergence  of
companies  that specialize  in big data. The demand  for big data is rapidly increasing  as large companies  are
quickly  adopting  the technology,  mainly in the financial  and services  industries.
Companies  that have adopted  big data are practically  using big data for business  through pilot tests,
beyond  simply using big data for information  collection.  Governments  are implementing  policies  to promote
R&D and professional  training,  building  industry-academia-R&D  governance,  and public data disclosure.
Of course, big data expansion  has produced  side effects,  such as privacy  infringement  and personal  profiling,
Therefore,  it is necessary  to strengthen  theflexibility  of data use by establishing  a new concept  for personal
data use. Comprehensive  policy support  that reflects  the social and market  environments  is necessary  for
the big data ecosystem  to evolve.
