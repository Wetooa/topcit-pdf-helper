A) Understanding  BPR
The concept  of business  process  reengineering  (BPR) was first introduced  in a paper published  by Professor  Michael
Hammer  of MIT in 1990. As products  from Asian countries  began to penetrate  the US market, US products  began
losing their competitiveness,  so Professor  Hammer  sought  to address  the root causes  of this problem  in his paper.
After analyzing  the causes of the decline  in U.S. competitiveness,  Hammer  found that U.S. products  were not actually
lagging behind in terms of product  competitiveness,  but that they were losing competitiveness  in terms of price and
quality. For American  companies  to provide the product  values that customers  were looking for, Hammer  felt that
the solution  lay in resolving  the problems  in the overall business  process,  and thus proposed  the concept  of BPR as a
solution  to those problems  in his paper.
@® Concept  of BPR
BPR is a technique  for redesigning  business  processes  in a fundamental  way in order to bring about a radical
improvement  in such performance  indicators  as cost, quality, service, and quickness.  There are four attributes  of BPR
that should be mentioned  here.
+ The first attribute  is ‘Basic’: In BPR, activities  are performed  to address  the basic problems  of an enterprise.  Through
BPR, answers  are sought  to such questions  as “For what purpose  is a business  task performed?”  “What are the
current  problems?”  and “What are the inefficient  elements  of an enterprise’s  operations?”
+ The second attribute  is ‘Zero Base’: BPR is all about designing  a new way of performing  business  tasks by
abandoning  existing  task procedures  or processes.
+ The third attribute is ‘Dramatic  Improvement’:  BPR is used only when an absolute  innovation  is needed.  Thus, BPR
signifies  a radical improvement  rather than a gradual improvement.
+ The fourth attribute  is ‘Process’:  The targets of BPR are mainly task processes.  BPR strives to resolve problems
through process-centric  thinking,  without  relying on jobs, workers,  or organizational  structures.  The aim is to
internalize  the processes  that drive business  values.
