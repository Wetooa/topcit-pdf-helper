Database )
@ Structure  can be understood  both by humans  and machines:  Makes it easy to compare  and collect  data.
© Separation  of content  and expression:  The format can be changed  according  to the user's preferences  (increased
reusability).
© Hierarchical  structure: Supports  structure  search and full text search.
@ Unicode:  Supports  multiple  languages.
B) Schematic  diagram  and components  of XML
XML is composed  of XML Document  Type Definition  (DTD) and the XML schema  for specifying  XML; the XPath for
processing  XML documents;  and XQuery, Extensible  Stylesheet  Language  (XSL), XML Linking  Language  (XLL), etc.
To create an XML document,  it is necessary  to fully understand  the XML components  and the basic syntax.

Component Description
+ XML Document  Type Definition
XML DTD + Adocument  that defines  the form of an XML document  in a consistent  structure.  XML DTD is
used to validate  XML.
+ High-level  data definition  language  used to specify  the structure  of an XML document  by
XML Schema replacing  XML DTD.
+ More complex  data types than XML DTD can be declared.
+ Alanguage  that expresses  extended  queries  so that the search condition  can be included  in the
XML path expression.
+ Astandard  XML query language  that can extract  intended  information  from an XML file as if
using a database.XPath
