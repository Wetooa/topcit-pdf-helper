There are three reasons  driving the spread of the infrastructure  for M2M communication.  The first reason is the
expanding  wireless  networks.  The coverage  of wireless  networks  and the guaranteed  service stability  greatly
facilitated  the growth of M2M communication.  The second reason is the declining  prices and increasing  availability
of telecommunication  modules.  The telecommunication  module market is growing  at more than 30% per year, but
prices are gradually  decreasing,  and market penetration  is rapidly increasing.  The third reason is the declining  price
of sensors.  As the market  expands,  sensor  technology  is getting more sophisticated,  but prices are falling, allowing
companies  that provide sensing-based  services  at low cost. These sensors  are expanding  from simple monitoring  to
fault and accident  detection,  asset management,  and customer  usage management  information.  Furthermore,  the
applications  of these sensors  are becoming  increasingly  diverse.  Starting  first with simple monitoring,  sensors  are now
being used to detect  malfunctions  and accidents,  manage  assets, and extract  data about customer  usage levels.
Typically,  the process  of developing  an M2M device first begins with developing  a module that contains  a mobile
chipset. Then the device is developed using the module.  An M2M device can be roughly  designed  as an object
consisting  of a chipset and a module and largely divided into three parts: a sensor/input&output  unit, a data
processing  unit, and a communication  module.

Presently,  M2M services  are provided  through  2G, 3G networks.
For nation-wide  large scale rollout, a universal  platform  must be
developed  and service  access protocols  must be established.Chipset

The data acquired  through  the input&output  uniit is processed  by the data processing  unit before it is sent to the
communication  module.  RS-232  or USB is used when sending  the data from the processing  unit to the communication
module.  The technology  used in M2M communication  defines  the technology  needed  for services  at the service layer
and takes a typical top-down  approach  to design the the lower layer to follow the definition  set by the service layer.
However,  this approach  can disrupt the standardization  and public sharing  of the technology  and hinder the growth
of the market. Therefore,  standardization  of the M2M environment  is a critical task for stimulating  the growth of the
market.
Q@loT (Internet  of Things)
The diffusion  of M2M technology  has opened  wide the era of loT which creates  an environment  where communication
takes place not only between  objects but everything  from people to objects, spaces are connected  to the Internet
to create, collect,  share, and utilize information  about everything,  Unlike the recent explosion  of public interest  in loT,
the idea of loT was already commercialized  a long time agolts  just that loT has been spreading/evolving  gradually
