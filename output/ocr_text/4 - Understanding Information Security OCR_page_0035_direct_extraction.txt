Information  security
(sender  and receiver)  is legitimate.  That is, authentication  can be divided into message  authentication  and user
authentication.
@ User  authentication
User authentication  refers to a function  that enables  the user to prove their identity  to the other party over
the network.  Given this, a third party should not be able to disguise  as the user.

[Figure 14] User authentication
User authentication,  also known as identification,  is used to verify the identity  of a user when logging in to a
server, and to grant the authority  of using information  services.  Servers should require the remote user to go
through  a strict authentication  procedure  because  the remote user can perform  all the privileges  as the user in
question,  once authenticated.
@ Message  authentication
Message  authentication  is to check whether  the contents  of the transmitted  message  have the original
information  and are not altered or modified.  An electronic  signature  can be used to verify that the transmitted
message  has not be altered,  and to identify  the sender  at the same time.
B) Type of authentication  methods
Authentication can be performed  by using the user’s knowledge,  the user's object, or the user’s physical
characteristics.
@® Knowledge-based  authentication
This method  is based on the user's information  (“What  you know’), and uses various means, such as a PIN
(Personal Identification  Number),  password,  account  number,  etc.
@ Ownership-based  authentication
This method  is based on the user’s possessions  (“What  you have’), and uses various means, such as anOTP (One
Time Password),  smart card, card key, etc.
® Presence-based  authentication
This method is based on the user’s body or characteristics  of their body ("What you are”), and uses various
means, such as iris recognition,  fingerprint  recognition,  voice recognition,  and face recognition.
