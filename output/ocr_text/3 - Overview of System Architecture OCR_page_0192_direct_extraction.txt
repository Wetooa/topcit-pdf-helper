Full duplex  communication + Full duplex communication  to deliver  data to both directions  simultaneously
Connection-oriented + SCTP is a connection-oriented  protocol  and is called association.
Reliability + The reliable transmission  protocol uses acknowledgment  to confirm  the arrival of data.
The number  systems  used by the SCTP include the transmission  sequence  number  (TSN), the stream identifier  (SI),
and the stream sequence  number  (SSN). The data units in TCP are bytes, whereas  data chunks  are data units in
SCTP. A transmission  sequence  number  (TSN) is used to number  data chunks. The SCTP's TSN plays a similar role
to the TCP’s sequence  number. Moreover, since multiple streams  may exist per SCTP association,  a 16-bit stream
identifier,  starting  from 0, is used to distinguish  them.
The SSN is used to distinguish  data chunks  belonging  to the same stream.
B) SCTP
Since it is not feasible  to discuss  everything  about SCTP this section  briefly  describes  the SCTP transmission  service,
as shown in the following  figure. SCTP functions  can be classified  into the following  eight types.
+ Association  start and end
+ Sequenced  delivery
+ User data fragmentation
+ Acknowledgment
+ Congestion  avoidance
+ Chunk bundling
+ Packet  validation
+ Path management
@ Association  start and end
An association  begins with an SCTP user's request.  When end-point  A sends an INIT chunk  to end-point  Z, in order to
prevent  an SYN attack  (synchronization  attack), end-point  Z sends the INIT ACK chunk containing  cookie information.
Upon receiving  it, end-point  A copies  the received  cookie and sends the COOKIE  ECHO chunk back to end-point  Z to
inform that it has been properly  received,  and end-point  Z sends the COOKIE-ACK  chunk again, to complete  the four-
way handshake.  Generating  a transmission  control block (TCB), which is the main system resource,  only when the
normal COOKIE  ECHO chunk is received  at end-point  Z, solves the denial of service (DoS) problem  caused by an SYN
attack, due to generating  a TCB as soon as the SYN segment  is received  during  the TCB connection  establishment.
@ Sequenced  delivery
In SCTP, a stream means a series of user messages.  The SCTP user can set the number  of streams  that can be
supported  when setting the association,  and these streams  are identified  by the stream identifier  SI. Moreover,
assigning  the SSN to the user message  in the stream, enables  the delivery of data chunks in normal order. Other
streams  can be transmitted  even if one stream is blocked  to deliver  the next sequence  of user messages.
© User data fragmentation
As in TCP, user messages  are limited by a path maximum  transmission  unit (MTU) in SCTP, and a fragmentation
