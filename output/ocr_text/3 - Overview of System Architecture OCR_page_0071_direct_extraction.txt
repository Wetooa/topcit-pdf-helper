ESSENCE
Each device needs two addresses  (a status/control  register  address  and a data register  address)  for I/O control, and
the same two addresses  are required  for each device. It is divided into the memory  mapped  |/O and the I/O mapped  |/
O, depending  on how the addresses  are allocated.
+ Memory  mapped  |/O: It is a method  of allocating  a part of the address  area in the memory  to the register  addresses
in the I/O controller,  as shown in [Figure 37]. It has the advantage  of easy programming,  but the disadvantage  of
reducing  the available  memory  space.

+ 1/O mapped  1/O: It is a method  of allocating  the I/O device address  space separately  from the memory  address
space, as shown in [Figure 38]. It has the advantage  of not reducing  the available  memory  address  space, but
the disadvantage  of making  it difficult  to program.

C) DMA
@® Concept  of DMA
DMA is a method  of the I/O device directly  accessing  the memory  without  the assistance of the CPU. The DMA
controller  controls  the bus, and the I/O device and memory  transfer  information  directly. [Figure 39] shows the
system  structure  that includes  the DMA controller.
