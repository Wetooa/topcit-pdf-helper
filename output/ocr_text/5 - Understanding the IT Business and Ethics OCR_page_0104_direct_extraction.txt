+ ITSM uses ITIL (IT infrastructure  library), which is the standard  model (best practice)  of the IT service.  Depending  on
the form of trade between  companies,  ITSM could be outsourced.
+ AnIT service  can only be realized  when a service  level agreement  (SLA) has been signed.
+ The signed SLA becomes  the standard  for measuring  the quality of the IT service, and systematic  management  of
the IT service  can be pursued  using SLM.
+ The customer  service  request  (CSR) process  is for requesting  an IT service.
ITSM uses the ITIL (IT infrastructure  library),  which is the standard  model (best practice)  of the IT service. Depending
on the form of trade between  companies,  ITSM could be outsourced.
In addition,  an IT service can be only realized  when  a service level agreement  (SLA) has been signed. The signed
SLA becomes  the standard  and the baseline  for measuring  the quality of the IT service.  Therefore,  it is important  to
establish  and manage  these standards.
Once the level of a service  has been decided  between  the user and service supplier,  the IT service  is delivered  at that
level. User requests  for IT services  will be handled  by the CSR (Customer  Service  Request)  process,
Some of the leading standards  associated  with IT service management  include eSCM and ISO/IEC 20000. These
standards  are all rooted in ITIL.
* The eSCM (eSourcing  Capability  Model) is an international  quality assessment  model used by service providers  to
objectively  evaluate  quality and capabilities  in order to provide IT services  to customers.  It provides  guidance  on
implementing  IT services  at all phases  of the business.
