void incorrect_password(const  char *user) {
static const char msg_format[]  = “%s cannot  be authenticated.  \n’:
size_t len = strlen(user)  + sizeof(msg_format):
char *msg = (char *)malloc(len);
if (msg == NULL) {
/* Error handling  */
}
int ret = snprintf(msg,  len, msg_format,  user);

Safe code /* Error handling  */
}
if (fputs(msg,  stderr) == EOF) {

}
The example  uses fputs(), instead of fprintf(),  to output msg as stderr, without  treating  is as a
format  string.
C) Major secure  coding  techniques  for Android-Java
@® Secure  coding  technique  for responding  to the attack against  the component  that can be accessed  from the outside
+ Attack overview:
If android: exported="true’”  is set in the manifest.xml  file for the component  of the Android application,
intent can be transferred  to the component,  from outside,  to activate  it. In this case, system  security  can be
breached,  because  the company  starts execution  in an unintended  situation.
* Coding  technique:
It is desirable  to not give the access  rights to the component  to the outside.
<Table 25> Code example
<manifest  xmins:---.>
<application  android:icon="@drawable/icon”  android:label="@string/label’>
<service  android:name=".syncadapterSyncService”  android:exported="true’>
Unsafe code | . Japplication>
</manifest>
Since the attribute  value of the SyncService  service is set to android:exported="true”,  a security  vulnerability
may occur when the component  is started  from outside.
<manifest  xmins:---.>
<application  android:icon="@drawable/icon”  android:label="@string/label’>
<service  android:name="  syncadapterSyncService”  android:exported=false”>
Safe code | </appjication>
</manifest>
If the Android:exported  property  is set to “false” or the setting  is removed,  the attribute  becomes  “false” and
access  from the outside  is blocked.
