1SO25000  is an integrated  software quality evaluation  model established  by International  Organization  for
Standardization.  Each division consists  of the integration  of existing  quality standards  such as 1SO14598  and
9126 and the development  of new standards  referring  to ISO/IEC  15288.

@ CMM\(Capability  Maturity  Model Integration)
CMMI is designed  to provide guidance  to improve  the processes  and capabilities  of an organization  that
develops,  acquires,  and maintains  software  products  or services.  It is a standard  to measure  the maturity  of a
software  development  organization  developed  by Software  Engineering  Research  Institute  of Carnegie Mellon
University.
<Table 60> CMMI Maturity  Levels
Classification Content
nerclld [Initial]  Organization  where it is difficult  to predict performance  results because  there is no
standardized  process
Level 2 [Managed]  Organization  in which the project  is managed  by building  a basic process
Level 3 [Defined]  Organization  in which the project  is controlled  with detailed  standard  processes
ren [Quantitatively  Managed]  Organization  capable  of predicting  performance  by quantitatively
managing  and controlling  project  performance  activities
[Optimizing]  Organization  in which continuous  improvement  activities  are established  and projectsee are carried out with optimal management
The following  is a table  comparing  software  process audit and certification  systems:  Software  Process  (SP)
certification  of Korea, international  standard  (ISO/IEC  15504) SPICE (Software  Process Improvement  and
Capability  Determination),  and CMMI of the US.
