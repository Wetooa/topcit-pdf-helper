blockchain.
A copy of the transaction  ledger is distributed  among network  members.  Whenever  a new transaction  occurs,
the transaction  is verified  by the consent  of the members.  The blockchain  uses a P2P network  method instead
of depending  on the existing  centralized  system. Therefore,  it is not necessary  for a transaction  broker to
intervene.  As a result, the efficiency  and transparency  of transactions  are increased,  and transactions  can be
made faster and safer, at a low cost. In addition,  as transaction  information  based on the blockchain  cannot be
forged and altered,  transaction  reliability  increases,  and transaction  information  can be easily traced.

B) FIDO (Fast Identity  Online  Alliance)
FIDO was established  in July 2012 to set the technical  (De facto) standard  for the authentication  method,  using
biometrics  in the online environment.  The FIDO standard  separated  local user authentication  in the user device
from remote  authentication  performed  by the service provider's  server.
@® FIDO 1.0
Even though FIDO 1.0 is similar to existing  biometric  authentication,  it provides  two authentication  methods:
the UAF (Universal  Authentication  Framework)  protocol  that does not store the user’s personal  information  on
the server, and the U2F (Universal  2nd Factor) protocol  that improves  security  using two-factor  authentication.
@ FIDO 2.0
FIDO 2.0 provides  a convenient  authentication  and payment  environment  using bio-information,  instead of the
password  in the PC and web environment.  It is expected  that more biometric  authentication  devices  will be
installed  in PCs and laptops, and various device authentication  methods,  using the smartphone  as a key, can
be provided.  FIDO 2.0 is a universal  authentication  technology  standard  that is developed  to provide the FIDO
clients and ASM on the platform.  Here, the platform  largely means the operating  system platform,  including
