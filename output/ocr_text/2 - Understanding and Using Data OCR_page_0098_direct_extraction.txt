criteria,  and a guideline  on what to prepare  to secure  a better  level is urgently  required.  The data quality management
maturity  model, which was developed  to satisfy  these requirements,  is composed  of three key elements,  namely,  the
data quality  standard,  the data quality management  process,  and the data quality  management  maturity  level.
@ Data quality  standard
+ Data validation  aspect: Accuracy,  consistency
+ Data utilization  aspect: Usability,  accessibility,  timeliness,  security
@ Data quality  control process
+ Processes  that are needed  to improve  the quality of accuracy,  consistency,  usability,  accessibility,  timeliness,  and
security  are identified.
+ Sometimes,  there is a one-to-one  correspondence  between  the quality standard  and the data quality management
process,  There are also processes  that are related to several quality standards  at the same time.
@ Data quality  control maturity  level
+ The level is defined  from 1 to 5.
+ The higher the maturity  level, the more the data is managed  systematically  and elaborately.
02 Data Standardization
Data standardization  means  that principles  for the name, definition,  format, and rule of data information  elements  are
established  and applied throughout  an organization.  It is indispensable  for improving  the clarity of communication  and
data quality and for reducing  the cost of data conversion  and cleansing.
A) Overview  of data standardization
@ Recently, interest  in data integration  and data quality has been increasing  because  data have emerged  as a key
element  of a corporation's  strategic  decision-making  process.
@ Data standardization  means that the principles  for the name, definition,  format,  and rule of data information  elements,
which are dispersed  in each system,  are established  and applied throughout  an organization.
@ The exact meaning  of data can be  understood,  and opposite  opinions  about data can be adjusted  through data
standardization.
B) Necessity  of data standardization
@ Improves  clarity of communication  by unifying  names.
@ Reduces  the time and effort spent on finding  the location  of the necessary  data.
© Improves  data quality by applying  consistent  data formats  and rules.
@ Reduces  the cost of data conversion  and cleansing  when designing  a data interface  between  information  systems.
