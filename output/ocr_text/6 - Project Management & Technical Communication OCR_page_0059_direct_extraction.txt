B) Presentation  scenario  creation
@ Logic development  suitable  for purpose,  target audience,  and place
Depending  on the purpose,  subject, audience,  and location  of the presentation,  use techniques  for developing
logic, such as placing  the key message  first or last. If the purpose  of the presentation  is to present  a solution
or if the target audience  is a high-ranking  person, telling the key message  first is preferable.  By presenting  the
conclusion  quickly, it has the advantage  of inducing  interest  and retaining  the audience's  attention.  On the
other hand, when a dramatic  story development  is necessary  or when the audience  is the subject of training,
conveying  the key message  later is desirable.  It has the advantage  of being able to slowly build a connection
with the audience  and make the conclusion  fully understandable.
@ Structure  table of contents
Once the logic development  method has been decided,  build a table of contents  to maintain  the flow. First
create first-level  heading  and then detailed  subsections.
© Check the logic flow
Check the logic flow based on the prepared  table of contents.  While simulating  the presentation,  check
whether  there is any disturbance  in the flow.
@ Define conclusion
Summarize  the contents  of the presentation  and organize  arguments  or suggestions  to be presented as the
final conclusion.  It is important  to define it so that the audience  can relate to the natural flow of the logic
development.
C) Presentation  material  creation
@ Things to Consider  beforehand
To make a presentation  material,  you must first organize  the storyboard  of the overall presentation.  The overall
flow and table of contents  should be determined,  and the content  to be presented  as a conclusion  should be clearly
defined.  In addition  to the story, visual factors  must also be considered.  These are as follows.
