<Table 39> shows the shapes of a router. Small networks  mostly use cisco 2500, while larger networks  use cisco
7300.

@ Router  metrics
It refers to the data collected  by a router at a given time, when the traffic passes through  the path. <Table 40>
shows the metric  types.
{Table 40) Routing Metrics [3]
Metric Description
It refers to the number  of routers  to pass through  in order to reach the destination.  The processing
speed is higher  when there are fewer routers.
MTU Maximum  Transmission  Unit. It refers to the maximum  data that the protocol  can transfer.
The cost according  to the transfer  time, link reliability,  and band characteristics  is determined.  A higher
cost means  lower efficiency.
Latency The packet  delay records  and bottlenecks  during the transfer  between  routers are determined.Number  of hops
Cost
