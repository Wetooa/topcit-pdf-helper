can increase,  and infected  systems  and encrypted  data may be unavailable  or deleted.
@ Major characteristics  of ransomware
+ Since ransomware  uses a private key encryption  system,  the encryption  key and the decryption  key must be
the same. If multiple  keys have been used for encryption,  batch decryption  is impossible,  or it takes a lot of
time, because  multiple  keys should be used for encryption.
+ Demanding  payment  by virtual currency  like Bitcoin
Even if the requested  amount  is paid in full, there is no 100% guarantee  for decryption.  An attacker  may
demand payment  by virtual currency,  such as Bitcoin, in exchange  for the decryption  of the encrypted  file.
However,  even if the requested  amount  is paid, full recovery  is impossible.
* Once ransomware  has made a successful  attack, modified  variants  are continuously  created.
Variants  with different  infection  paths and attack methods  constantly  appear, such as CryptoLocker,
Cryptowall,  and CryptXXXx.
© Procedure  of the ransomware  attack
Accessing  to the infection  path > Downloading  ransomware  to a PC and executing  ransomware  — Searching
for encryption  targets  (document  files, images, etc.) and encrypting  them—  Demanding  money  for decryption
@® Countermeasures  against  ransomware
+ Keeping  all actives  programs  up to date
Malware infection  attacks  using software  vulnerabilities  are increasing,  such as Windows  operating  systems,
Internet  browsers,  such as Internet  Explorer,  Chrome,  Firefox, etc., and programs  used in a PC (Hangul, MS
Office, Adobe, Java, etc.). In particular,  the “zero-day  attack’ is increasing  which uses the vulnerability  as soon
as an operating  system or software  vulnerability  is discovered.  Therefore,  the operating  system and all active
programs  should be kept up-to-date,  and security  updates  should be applied immediately.
+ Installing  the latest anti-virus  program  on the PC and smartphone
Basically,  anti-virus  programs  should be installed  to protect  the PC or smartphone  safely from malware.
Furthermore,  anti-virus  engines should be updated  on a regular basis, and automatic  updatesare
recommended.  In addition,  users sometimes  need to check whether  the anti-virus  program  is properly
performing  in real-time  and with periodic  checks, and whether  anti-virus  engines  are updated  regularly.  The
anti-virus  program  should always be updated  to the latest version because  modified  variants  of malware  may
appear, or new types of malware  may appear.
+ Setting  the pop-up blocker
Hackers  use adware to register  fake advertising  sites that distribute  malware  in the user's PC. The software
download  site distributes  adware  to users, and users access the fake advertising  site using the adware.  Then,
the user’s PC is infected  with malware.  That’s why users have to block  the advertising  pop-up  windows  using
a pop-up  blocker  in the Internet  web browser.
+ Refraining  from distributing  e-mail addresses  and periodically  changing  account  passwords
You should refrain from distributing  your e-mall address because hackers can send e-mails that contain
