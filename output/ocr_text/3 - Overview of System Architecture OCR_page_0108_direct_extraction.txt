Overview  of System Architecture )
Technologies  applied  to embedded  OS can be characterized  by real-time,  small/lightweight,  and low power
consumption,  as shown in <Table 22>.
{Table 22) Embedded  OS Application
Application Description
Real-time  multitasking Real-time  synchronization  mechanism  and real-time  resource  management  function  to improve
technology the guarantee  and predictability  of real-time  services,  along with real-time  scheduling
Lightweight  kernel Basic kernel support  technology  to provide  a solution  suitable  for a system targeting  a specific
technology application  with limited resources,  according  to the characteristics  of the embedded  system
Power management Power management  system for embedded  systems,  including  portable  information  home
technology appliances  using small batteries  in a ubiquitous  environment
. Basic support  technology to support  ultra-small/ultra-low-resource  embedded  systems,  such asTiny kernel technology pp ae ey pe . , *sensor  networks  in ubiquitous  environments
C) Types and trends  of embedded  OS
Embedded  software  runs in a wide range of devices and supports  many operating  systems.  However,  it is largely
divided into real-time  operating  systems  that must satisfy conditions  to operate  within a set time, and operating
systems  that do not.
+ Real-time  OS (RTOS): Mainly focuses  on controlling  application  programs  or hardware  affected  by a limited  amount
of time. The leading  operating  systems  include  VxWorks,  VRTX, QNX, and pSOS.
+ Non real-time  OS: Mainly  focuses  on development  convenience,  scalability,  and diverse  operating  environments.  The
leading  operating  systems  include  Linux series, embedded  Window  XP, and Windows  CE.
Traditionally,  an embedded  OS was used because  systems,  such as satellites  and missile controllers,  that must have
flawless protection  against  errors needed  to have an OS optimized  for real-time  systems. In that case, the systems
used RTOS, instead  of a general-purpose  OS.
However,  one of the latest trends in embedded  OS technology  is that the portion of Linux and free RTOS is steadily
increasing,  when compared  to traditional  embedded  RTOS, such as VxWorks,  pSOS, QNX, and VRTX, which have
led the existing  information  home appliance  market and other embedded  application  industries  (see [Figure 74]).
Linux is installed  in about 65% of all embedded  devices  and is still growing  very fast, at an annual average  of 17%.
Meanwhile,  the UK's FreeRTOS  is rapidly expanding  its base. The market  share is around 50%, which makes it the de-
facto standard.  In addition  to FreeRTOS,  ARM's mbed, which was recently  acquired  by Softbank  in Japan, is spreading
rapidly. Of course, commercial  products  are still leading in markets  that require a  high degree of safety, such as in
automobiles,  aircrafts,  and railways.
