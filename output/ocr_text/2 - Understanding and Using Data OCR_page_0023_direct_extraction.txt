ESSENCE
as a physical  file structure.
+ Application  programmers  can implement  the data access method in the application program  only when they know
the physical  data structure  very well.
+ Sharing  data naturally  becomes  difficult  in an environment  where each application  program has its own data.
Therefore,  one file ultimately  exists only for one application  only.
@ Problems  with the file system
+ Inability  to guarantee  data independence  - Program  dependent.
+ Problem  of ensuring  data consistency  - Time dependence  of a file (which has a different  value depending  on the
time of retrieval).
+ Problem  of ensuring  data integrity  - Values that are semantically  the same should remain identical.
+ Low sharing  and use convenience  - Low economic  feasibility  and poor security  management.
B) Concept  and characteristics  of the database
@® Concept  of the database
The database  has the characteristics  of integration,  operation,  storing, and sharing. In the past, data were inevitably
saved in duplicate  when recorded  on paper, because  even the same data could not be shared in real time. Data
were also saved in several files in duplicate  even when the file system was in use. The database, however,  manages
duplicated  data in one place as intensively  as possible  to eliminate  duplication  to the maximum.

Classification Contents
This means  that the same data are not duplicated  in principle
Integrated  data + Minimal  redundancy
+ Controlled  redundancy
Stored data Data are saved in a storage  medium  that can be accessed  by a computer  (tape, disk, etc,).
Data which are required  to perform  the unique functions  of an organization.  (Temporary  data
used while performing  a task, such as simple input/output,  are not operational  data.)
Data which are jointly owned, maintained,  and used by several application  programs  within an
organization.Operational  data
Shared data
@ Characteristics  of the database
The shared database  can be accessed  in real time using the programming  language,  and is constantly  changing  due
to the input, modification  and deletion  of data. The database  can also be accessed and  shared by multiple  users
simultaneously,  and it has the characteristic  of being referable  by using the contents  of data.

Concurrent  sharing Supports  the concurrent  sharing  of the same data in different  ways.
