The following  is an acquisition/management  process  framework  among  SW standard  processes  for acquisition
and managing  public projects  based on ISO/IEC 12207. The acquisition/management  process  framework  is a
system that defines  basic activities  in the entire life cycle for software  introduction,  and procedures  and activ-
ities for performing  basic activities  from a managerial  and engineering  perspective.  The framework  consists  of
three life cycle processes:  primary:  supporting  and organizational,  and 20 subprocesses.
