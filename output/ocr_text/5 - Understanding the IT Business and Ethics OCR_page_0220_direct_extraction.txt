In a paper titled “The Social Dilemma  of Autonomous  Vehicles”  published  in the scientific  journal Science  in
June 2016, a survey  on self-driving  cars was conducted.
The question  was as follows.
There is a self-driving  car whose brakes are broken while driving. If you drive as it is, you would hit 5
pedestrians,  and if you turn the steering  wheel, you would hit 1 pedestrian.  The car has a program  that
makes judgments  about the steering  wheel, but if the person who would be injured by turning  the steering
wheel is not a pedestrian  but a car occupant,  who should the vehicle save between  the pedestrian  and the
occupant?
In this survey, the majority of people (78%) said it was more ethical to protect  the most number  of
pedestrians.  What was interesting  was the next question.
When asked, “Would you buy an autonomous  vehicle that prioritizes  the safety of pedestrians  over car
occupants?”,  most people answered  that they would not buy such a car. It would be rational  to prioritize  the
more number  of pedestrians,  but if the car occupant  is you or your family, you may end up in a dilemma.
This ethical dilemma  is emerging  as an inevitable  challenge  in the era of the Fourth Industrial  Revolution.
Therefore,  by thinking  about the ethical issues of the latest technology,  it is necessary  to understand  the
safe use of technology  by looking at the benefits  of technology  and problems  that may arise from the
misuse  of technology.
