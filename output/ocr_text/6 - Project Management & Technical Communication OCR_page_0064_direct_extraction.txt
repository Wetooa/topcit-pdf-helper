portant  question,  it may lead to poor outcomes.  Likewise,  the important  points for on-site  presentation  are as
follows.
+ Preliminary  Inspection  of the Presentation  Venue
It is necessary  to look around the presentation  venue in advance,  visualize  a scene in which the audience  is
seated,  and simulate  the range of motion,  gestures,  and a simple practice  of presentation.
+ Be familiar  with the order of presentation  material
Check whether  you are familiar  with the sequence  and flow of the presentation  material.  Glancing  over at
the material  while speaking  may often make you look less confident  because  you do not make eye contact
with the audience,  which may undermine  credibility  in what you say, and make the presentation  itself boring.
Therefore, you should always be familiar  with the order of the presentation  material  and maintain  a natural
flow so that you can continue  your presentation  even without  reading  the material.
+ Appropriate  and Interesting  Opening  Comments
You should start your presentation  with a story that can relate to topics such as simple weather,  current
status, and recent issues, and that can arouse the audience's  interest.  If you go straight  into the topic
from the beginning,  the atmosphere  may become  rigid and the relationship  between  the presenter  and
the audience  may become  awkward.  It's okay to talk lightly, so prepare  a comment  that can help create a
comfortable  atmosphere  of the first encounter  with the audience.
+ Presentation  Material  Review
Check the prepared  presentation  material  for any errors. Since the style in which the prepared  material is
displayed  may vary depending  on the version  or font of the presentation  tool software,  it is recommended  to
bring with a laptop, etc. to be ready for an unexpected  situation.
+ Key points of each sheet and appropriate  examples  to promote  understanding
Check the key points to be presented  for each sheet once again, and whether  the cases prepared  to promote
better understanding  are well connected.  It is also good to make good use of presentation  tools or prepare  a
simple cue sheet.
+ Impressive  closing  comments
At the end of the presentation,  prepare  a closing comment  so that you can leave an impressive  message  to
your audience.  It is also good to use aphorisms  or quotes related to the contents  of the presentation, or  to
convey  impressively  the good words you saw in the book. The important  point is that the closing  comment  is
well linked to the subject  so that the subject  content  can be more deeply relatable.
B) Effective  use of body language
According  to The Law of Mehrabian,  93% of non-verbal  body language  such as gestures  and tone of voice is
used to persuade  the other person in actual communication.  The logical explanation  occupies  only 7%. Here,
body language  includes  voice.
