D) Subnetting
@ Concept  of subnetting
Subnetting  is a method  of dividing  a network  address  into multiple  smaller  networks.  A subnet  mask refers to a mask
to separate  the network  address  of the IP address  [8].

@ Use of subnet
Adding  a sub-network  generates  an intermediate  layer in the IP address  in order to separate  the address  into the site,
subnet,  and host.
