[Fig. 47] Transformation  of the business  environment
Many companies  that have entered the global market are now experiencing  difficulties  because  of the long global
economic  downturn  and low growth. As domestic  growth slows and direct overseas  investments increase,  the
costs that companies  have to bear are increasing,  while the corporate  business  environment  is becoming  ever more
complicated  due to the opening  of markets  and fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates. To overcome  this situation,
large companies  are implementing  a number  of different  strategies,  such as expanding  global sourcing  and entering
the service industry  in the case of manufacturing  companies.
@ Characteristics  of IT business  environment  transformation
To respond  to the ongoing  transformation  of the business  environment,  companies  are diversifying  their businesses
to gain a competitive  advantage  in the market  through  new business  models.  Among  the approaches  that companies
employ  to develop  new business  models are specialization,  modularization,  scaling up, internationalization,  and
networking.  The rapid development  of IT technology  and the advent  of the smart era are also driving  the latest shifts
in the business  paradigm.
Changes  in the internal and external  environments  surrounding  corporate  business  activities  are accelerating,
manifesting  themselves  in the form of endlessly  evolving  IT, changes  in consumption  patterns,  diversification  of
platforms,  and increasing  calls for innovation  from companies.
The gradual blurring and disappearance  of business  boundaries  (occasioned  by offline companies’  entry into the
online market,  the growth  of mobile businesses,  and the emergence  of convergent  businesses,  etc.)  which previously
guarded  different  areas of competition,  have diversified  business  channels  by, for instance,  paving  the way for the rise
of the online market.  Through  the online market,  enterprises  have gained the opportunity  to meet diverse  customers
and create new synergies.  In addition,  new business  concepts  have emerged  that reflect the latest consumption
trends, such as SNS-based  smart shopping  and the growth of one-person  Internet  companies  and crowd sourcing.
