B) Account  and password  management
© Deleting  unnecessary  accounts
In many cases, accounts  created by default when installing  the OS or package,  use the default password.
Accounts  that are not deleted by the system as well as suspicious accounts  should be deleted,  because  they
can be exploited  for the password  guessing  attack. In general,  system accounts  that do not require login should
be prohibited  from logging  in.
+ How to delete unnecessary  accounts
# userdel [Ip | uucp | nuucp | Account  to be deleted]  on SUN/HP-UX.
# rmuser  [Ip | uucp | nuucp | Account  to be deleted]  on AIX.
@ Checking  the account  that uses a vulnerable  password
In general,  if a password  that is easy to guess is set for an account,  unauthorized  users can access  the system.
A password  should be set using a combination of 8 or more letters, numbers,  and special characters  that are
not the same or similar to the account  name.
+ How to check the account  that uses a vulnerable  password  method:
Check the password,  using a password  cracking  tool, such as “john the ripper’.
Create a password.txt  file in the same directory  as the john script.
Copy the contents  of the password  encryption  file /etc/shadow  (/etc/passwd  for HP-UX), paste it into the
password.txt  file, and input john password.  txt.

unauthorized  persons  can register  a malicious  program  in this file and execute  it with root privileges.  Therefore,
include those who will be allowed  to access  in the /etc/hosts.  allow and include those who will be denied in the
/etc/hosts.  deny file.
@ Setting  session  idle timeout
If timeout  is not set for a session that is not in use, it may cause problems,  both in confidentiality  and
availability.  Therefore,  the connected session should be set in a way that it is blocked from the server in
question,  if not used for a specified  period  of time.
+ How to set session  idle timeout
Add “TIMEOUT=300"  (stop sessions  if not used for 300 seconds)  to the “/etc/default/login’  file.
Add “TMOUT=300,  export TMOUT”  to the /etc/profile  or .profile file in HP-UX, AIX, and Linux.
