@ NFV application  cases
NFV uses virtualization  to implement  network  equipment  functions.  It not only operates  on specialized  equipment,
but also implements  the network  equipment  functions  in a general high-performance  x86 server platform,  as shown
in [Figure 154].

D) SDN and NFV
Initially, SDN was developed  mainly by researchers  and data center designers,  and NFV was developed  by Internet
service providers  (ISPs). However,  SDN and NFV technologies  are complementary  to each other, and ISPs currently
combine  the two technologies  and apply them to networks.

[Figure 155] Relationship  between  NFV SDN [8]
SDN enables  faster change by creating  an abstracted  network,  and NFV reduces  capital expenditures  (CAPEX),
operating  expenditures  (OPEX), and space and resource  consumption.  NFV and SDN have a complementary
relationship  and can be independently  configured.
