A hacker who infiltrated  into an accommodation  app last year was found to have leaked personal
information  of 2.9 million people from eight other companies  during the same period. The leaked personal
information  included  website ID as well as name, date of birth, e-mail, mobile phone number, address,
passport  number, etc. The information  about 3,239,000  cases of accommodation  reservation  and 178,625
members,  as well as personal  information  about 971,877  members  (excluding  duplicative  cases) were found
to have been leaked from several companies.  In addition,  4817 menacing  and obscene  texts were sent by
abusing  the leaked accommodation  details.
The Korea Communications  Commission  found that the act amounts  to a “severe act of violation”  and
imposed  the penalty, as it violates  a number  of personal  information  protection  measures  such as access
control, access record preservation,  encryption,  and expiration  date set forth in the “Act on Promotion  of
Information  and Communication.  Network  Utilization  and Information  Protection,  Etc.” (the "Network  Act’).
The following  are examples  of personal  information  leaks in domestic  companies.
