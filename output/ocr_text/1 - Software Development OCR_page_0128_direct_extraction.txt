02 Software  Maintenance  Activities
A) Software  maintenance  procedure
Software  is generally  maintained  in the following  order.
<Table  45> Maintenance  procedure
Maintenance  procedure Contents
+ Program  structure  analysis,  variable/data  structure,  application  field, business
knowledge.
+ Maintenance  type, strategy  establishment  (modification/new).
+ Identifying  targets  such as the changed  program.
Identifying  and modifying  the scope + Impact  of software  change  on existing  functions
of impact + Program  change,  modification.
Test/maintenance + Performing  document  modification,  configuration  management,  and maintenance.Understanding  current  software
Requirements  analysis
“Requirements  analysis”,  which is an important  activity  in the above maintenance  sequence,  aims to quickly  understand  how a
maintenance  request  affects  the current  system.  “Identifying  the scope of impact”  may be easy or require  tremendous  efforts,
as described  in the example,  depending  on how easy it is to maintain  the software  in the existing  system.  Ease of maintenance
is a characteristic  that indicates  the level of difficulty  in maintaining  software,  and there are the following  types.
+ Ease of use: A characteristic  that indicates  how easy it is to understand  an application  or program.
+ Ease of modification:  A characteristic  that indicates  how easy it is to modify an application  or program.
+ Ease of testing:  A characteristic  that indicates  how easy the process  is to show the accuracy  of an
application  or program.
Therefore,  if systematic  activities  are performed  to improve  ease of maintenance  while developing  software,  as shown in the
following,  the requirements  of users or customers  can be continuously  satisfied,  and rapidly  increasing  maintenance  costs can
be handled  economically  even in the event of changes  in the environment  in the future.
+ Analysis  activities:  Determining  the customer's  requirements  and constraints,  and proving  the validity  of the
product  to be developed.
+ Standards  and guidelines:  Establishing  various kinds of standards  and guidelines  to facilitate  software
maintenance.
+ Design activities:  Emphasizing  and making  use of clarity, modularity,  and ease of change.
+ Implementation  activities:  A standard  structure  and coding style should be applied.
+ Supporting  documents:  The guide and test manual required  for maintenance  activities.
B) Types of software  maintenance  organizations
IEEE/EIA  12207 defines  maintenance  personnel  as “an organization  that performs  maintenance  activities”.  The term
