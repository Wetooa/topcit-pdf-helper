ESSENCE
- It is easy to apply to a project  and manage.
- A measure  that can effectively manage  the start/end  of development  activities  and the project
can be clearly  defined.
- The model emphasizes  project  verification  and validation.  In other words, the model explains  very
well the association  relationship  between  development  activities,  such as requirements  analysis
and design, and design activities.  The development  activities  and corresponding  test activities
are performed  at the same time during  the entire development  cycle.
- By doing so, we can understand  which phase of the development  activity  should be performed
again, if a software  fault is found during  the test.
@ V model with prototyping
+ Prototyping  is a method of developing  a system or a part of a system to understand  a system or to
solve such issues as risks or uncertainties.  Prototyping  can lead developers and customers  to commonly
understand  what is needed  and what should be developed.  Prototyping  can be applied to the development
phase of the Waterfall  model or V model, and can also be used as an independent  lifecycle  model
+ The uncertainty  factors and risks of a project  can be reduced by adding the prototyping  technique  to the V
model. The uncertainty  factors and risks of a project  include the possibility  of implementing  the requirements
in the requirement  phase, the status of verifying  system performance  in the design phase, and risk factors
when introducing  new tools and developing  a system by outsourcing.  The prototyping  technique  can be
performed  using the following  two approaches.
- OApproach  1: Seek applicable  solutions  and apply them. This approach  can be applicable  when the
problem  to be solved is not clear. For example,  this approach  can be used when implementing
the user interface  of a new device, when seeking  a method  of improving  a system’s  performance,
or when managing  errors or faults.
- The general  procedure  for performing  actions  is as follows:
1. Define  the uncertainty  factors.
2. Seek a solution  and define how to apply it.
3. Try to apply the solution.  (It can be reiterated.)
4. Find the cause of the uncertainty  factor based on the result of step 3.
OApproach  2: Enumerate  several solution  options  and evaluate  them according  to the established
standards.  This approach  is appropriate  when there is a risk or uncertainty  factor in the solution  to be
applied.  For example,  this approach  can be used if middleware  should  be selected  for a specific  function
or if the performance  of a design for several  environmental  factors  should be taken into account.
- The general  procedure  for performing  actions  is as follows.
1. Define  the uncertainty  factors.
2. Enumerate  the solutions  that can be selected  and define the selection  criteria.
3. Evaluate  the solutions  according  to the selection  criteria.
4, Select  the most suitable  solution.
