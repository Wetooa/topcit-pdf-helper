>> Recent  trends and major issues
Most of the databases  we experience  in the field are running  in a multi-user  environment.  Therefore, the
atomicity  of transactions  should be guaranteed  by controlling  interactions  among transactions  when
multiple  transactions  are executed  in a database  simultaneously.  To this end, concurrency  control methods
are used. Most of the DBMSs  we use have these methods.  Therefore,  if transactions  are wrongly  designed
due to a lack of understanding  of the concurrency  control  technique,  such as the locking  mechanism  applied
to the DBMS, problems  may occur due to a transaction  delay, such as processing  performance  degradation,
deadlock,  and so on. And users who are accustomed  to the fast processing  of information  systems  may
raise complaints  about the service  delay.
The recent DBMS has several advanced  features  such as a function  that internally ensures  the isolation
of transactions  and considers  concurrent  processing  performance  or the inclusion  of an algorithm  that
detects  and handles  deadlocks  quickly. However,  those features  are minimal  and provisional  measures,  not a
fundamental  solution.  Therefore,  the concepts  of transaction,  concurrency  control, and deadlock  need to be
clearly understood  in order to develop  a system  that delivers  high performance  in a multi-user  environment.
1. To be able to explain the concept  and characteristics  of a transaction.
2. To be able to explain the transaction-commit  operation and the rollback operation  for aborting  a
transaction.
3. To be able to explain the purposes,  necessity,  and techniques  of concurrency  control.
4 To be able to explain 2-phase  locking  (2-PL).
5. To be able to explain and apply a transaction  isolation  level.
6. To be able to explain  the causes  of and solutions  to transaction  deadlocks.
