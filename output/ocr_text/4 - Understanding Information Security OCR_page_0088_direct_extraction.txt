Misuse  of cryptographic  | Decrypting  ciphertext,  using unreliable  cryptographic  modules  and an inappropriate  cryptographic
modules mode.
@ Countermeasures  against  database  security  threats
There are access  controls,  views, and cryptographic  techniques  to cope with database  security  threats.
<Table 29> Countermeasures  against  database  security  threats
Item Details Case
Ieeeeecontrals Allowing  only authorized  users to access  the database  and Account  management
preventing  unauthorized  users from accessing  the database  itself. MAC, DAC, RBAC
viene Limiting  access  to the permitted  data only among  the entire CREATE  VIEW
database,  using views.
Encryption Saving important  data after encrypting  with one-way  and two-way SEED, AES
cipher  algorithms. SHA-256
02 Database  access  control
A) Database  access  control  policy
@ Discretionary  access  control (DAC) policy
A method  of controlling  access to objects, based on the subject or the identity  of the group to which the
subject  belongs. On object owner determines  access  permission.
e.g.,) The owner of the table can grant or revoke the privilege  to another  person.
@ Mandatory  access  control (MAC) policy
Access  to an object is controlled,  based on the owner's  rights to the confidential  object.
e.g.) Allowing  only the database  administrator  to access  the system catalog.
® Role-based  access control (RBAC) policy
The central administrator  controls  the relationship  between  the subject and object, and decides  on access to
the resource,  based on their roles in the organization.
