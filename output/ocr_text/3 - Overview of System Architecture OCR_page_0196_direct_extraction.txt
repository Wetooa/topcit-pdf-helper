[Figure 138] shows the operational  path of the application  program  over the Internet.  It shows that
application  layer programs,  like transport  layer protocols,  operate  on the service  end-to-end.  In other words,
like transport  layer protocols,  such as TCP, the nodes, like wired/wireless  routers  positioned  between  end-
points, do not affect the operation  of transport  layer protocols.  Although  users can generate  and exchange
them as needed, the most widely used application  programs  tend to use the internationally  recognized
standard  application  layer protocols  in order  to ensure compatibility.

[Figure 138] Operational  Path of Application  Layer Protocol
[Figure 139] shows the operational  procedure  between  the application layer  and transport  layer protocols,
according  to user A’s web use scenario  described  in “I. Network  concept”. It shows user A logging  into the
webserver,  my.servercom,  and downloading  the my.pdf  file. Although  this section  focuses  on the operation
of the application  layer protocol,  HTTP. it also shows interaction  with the transport  layer protocol  for better
understanding.
