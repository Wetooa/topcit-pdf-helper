The service personnel  will then visit the customer  at the appointed  time to examine  the problem  with the printer and
repair it. The service  personnel  will request  the customer's  signature  as confirmation  of completion  of the repair work.
In the case of paid repairs, the customer  will be billed for the repairs,  which translates  into revenues  for the company.
When the sales amount  and service  fee are settled and  a sale is confirmed,  a tax invoice is issued and delivered  to
the customer.  Upon receipt  of the tax invoice,  the customer  proceeds  with the payment.
The money received and deposited  by the customer  is settled by crediting  the accounts  receivables  through the
deposit  process.  This series of processes  enables  the enterprise  to perform  two activities.  First, it can provide
customer  services  through service activities  and, second, it can generate  profits. The processes  involved in the
payment-based  service  fall under the following  job domains:  service,  accounting,  materials,  and revenue  (sales).
While some of these business  processes  are firmly cemented,  most of them have to be improved  and be able
to adapt flexibly to changes  in the business  environment.  An environment  must be created  wherein waste and
bottlenecks  can be constantly  identified  and jobs quickly  processed.
