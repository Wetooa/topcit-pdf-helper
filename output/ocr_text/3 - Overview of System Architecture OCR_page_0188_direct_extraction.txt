{Table 63) RWND and CWND
‘Type Description
Receiver  window + The size of the packet  that the receiver  can receive without  data loss.
(RWND) + It notifies  the status to the other end of the segment  containing  an ACK.
C +i ind + The size of the packet  that can be sent at once, according  to the network  congestion
one CWND) OW | «The CWND gets smaller, since data loss during the transmission  increases  if the network  congestion  is
high. It gets larger if the congestion  is low.
@ Error control
Error control is activated  when the transmitted  segment  is lost, damaged,  out of order, or duplicated.
{Table 64) TCP Error Control  Tools
Tool Description
Checksum + Each segment  contains  a checksum  field to indicate  if the segment  is damaged.
Acknowledgment + The acknowledgment  is used to confirm receiving  the data segment.
+ The key to the error control  mechanism.  The segment  is stored in a buffer until the acknowledgment  isResend ;
received.
© Congestion  control
Congestion  control is a mechanism  and technique  of maintaining  the user traffic volume input to the network  to
ensure that it does not exceed the network  capacity,  TCP performs  the congestion  control, based on the slow start
algorithm  and the congestion  avoidance  algorithm.
The slow start algorithm  exponentially  increases  the congestion  window  size for congestion  control, until it reaches
the limit.
