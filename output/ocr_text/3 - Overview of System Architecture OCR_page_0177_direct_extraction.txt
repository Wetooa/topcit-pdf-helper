(Table 55) NAT Type [11]
Type Description
. - NAT that connects  to the Internet  with public IP addresses,  as many as the number  of terminals  with private IP
Basic NATaddresses
NAPT - NAT in which multiple  terminals  with private  IP addresses  connect  to the Internet,  with a public IP address  to
save public IP addresses
08 IPv6 Overview
A) What is an IPv6 (Internet  Protocol  Version  6) address?
IPv6 is the next-generation  Internet  protocol  with a 128-bit addressing  system developed  to solve the current IPv4
problems,  such as address  depletion,  security,  and mobility  support.
B) Background  of IPv6
The rapidly increasing  hosts and terminals  connected  to networks  have led to problems  with the existing IPv4
addressing  system, such as a shortage  of IP address  space and poor Internet  security.  The IPv6 protocol  [16] was
developed  in the mid-90s  to solve the problems. Compared  to the existing  IPv4, the most notable feature of IPv6
is the expansion  of the address  space, from 32 bits, to 128 bits, to enable the use of approximately  3.4 x 1032
addresses,  thereby  fundamentally  solving the problem of address shortage.  Moreover,  it has simplified  the head
format, by removing  header fields that IPv4 does not frequently  use and supports  effective  QoS services.  While
IPv4 does not include security  functions,  it is necessary  to install a security  protocol  called IPsec (Internet  Protocol
Security)  [17][18] separately.  IPv6 has added security  and personal  protection  functions, by providing  the end-to-end
encryption  function  in order to solve these problems.
09 IPv6 Addressing  System  and Header  Structure
A) IPv6 addressing  system
IPv6 addresses  are 128 bit long, four times that of IPv4, and expressed  in hexadecimal. It consists  of the format fix
(PF)that  describes  the address  format and the address  field. A colon separates  each 16-bit field, and each field is
expressed  in hexadecimal  to make it easier to read the long addresses.  The notation  of the IPv6 address network
prefix is similar  to the CIDR notation  of IPv4. The IPv6 address  is followed  by '/", and the length of the network  prefix
is written in decimal. <Table 56> below shows an example  of the IPv6 address  format  prefix.
