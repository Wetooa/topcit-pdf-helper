product  development  and architectural  projects  with much accumulated  technology  or experience.  It is a cycle
in which the entire scope of the project  is defined  at the initiating  stage and the schedule  and cost are carried
out according  to the plan.
The iterative  life cycle is a model in which a product  is divided  into parts that are developed  repeatedly  to
complete  a final product.  Iterative  life cycles can be divided into incremental  and evolutionary  types.
+ Incremental  life cycle: The scope of the project is divided into multiple  phases in which the activities  of the
project  are run in parallel and overlapped  gradually  and repeatedly.
+ Evolutionary  life cycle: The project is divided into several phases, and the iteration itself proceeds
sequentially.

The adaptive  life cycle refers to an agile process  that reacts promptly  to external  changes,  and its purpose  is
to flexibly  respond  to changing  requirements  to fulfill the value of the project.
