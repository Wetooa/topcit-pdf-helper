@® Smart water grid
Due to climate changes  that affect the management  of water, there is growing  interest  in smart water grid, the
technology  for managing  water with ICT technology.  Smart water grid is a smart technology  that leverages  ICT
technology  for the management  of water, that essential  substance  for humanity  as well as the water supply and
