@ Options  of the logical link layer service
The LLC options include Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Type 1 is an unconfirmed datagram  service and called an
unconnected  service, as it does not require a receipt confirmation  message.  Type 2 is a virtual circuit access type
and, as a TCP service, transfers  data after establishing  a virtual session.  Type 3 is a confirmed  datagram  service and
provides  the receipt  confirmed  datagram  in the point-to-point  method.
C) MAC
The MAC sub-layer  is responsible  for determining  how to transfer  data through  the physical  media.
The MAC layer includes  the MAC addresses  of the transmitting  and receiving  systems,  as shown in [Figure 107]
below. The MAC address  is mainly divided  into two addresses.  The first 224is OUI (Organizationally  Unique Identifier),
representing  the manufacturer  identification  code, and the remaining  224 is the serial number  of the NIC produced  by
the manufacturer.

[Figure 107] MAC Address  Configuration
The standardized  MAC protocols  include  the CSMA/CD  type IEEE 802.3, the token bus type IEEE 802.4, and the token
ring type IEEE 802.5 for wired LAN. The CSMA/CA  type IEEE 802.11 MAC sub-layer  is used for wireless  LAN.
04 MAC Address  Search
A) IP address  and MAC address  conversion  protocol
To transfer  a packet to another  host, requires  the host’s MAC address.  ARP (Address  Resolution  Protocol)  is
responsible  for it. The protocols  to convert  the IP and MAC addresses  are the ARP and RARP (Reverse  Address
Resolution  Protocol).  The ARP that has the following  address  checks the MAC address  through  the IP address,  and
RARP is the inverse  address  conversion  protocol  that checks  the IP address  through  the MAC address.
