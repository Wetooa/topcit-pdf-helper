Since the database  collects and stores a large amount  of data, from personal  information,  to
corporate  confidential  information,  it is an important  asset to protect  for an organization,  in addition
to being a key target for attackers.  Therefore,  database  access  control and encryption  policies  should
be established,  and countermeasures  should be prepared  to identify  various  security  threat elements
of the database  and safely protect  important  data from these security  threats.
Company  A decided  to come up with access control and encryption  measures  to safely manage
the database  and requested  consulting  by submitting  the following  requirements  to the consulting
company:
1) Company  A experiences  frequent  organization  and business  changes.  Therefore,  the company
needs a database  access  control system  that can be flexibly  applied  to such changes.
2) Company  A should encrypt  uniquely  identifiable  information,  within the period stipulated  by the
law, in accordance  with the revision  of the Personal  Information  Protection  Act.
3) Company  A should thoroughly  analyze  the impact  of encrypting  uniquely  identifiable  information  in
order to prevent  system failure and performance  degradation.
Therefore,  let’s review the database  access control system that is desirable  for company  A, and the
methods  for encrypting  uniquely  identifiable  information  and matters  to consider.
