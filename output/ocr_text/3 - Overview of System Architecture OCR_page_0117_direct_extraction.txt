As such, this chapter  reflects  the government  guidelines  for calculating  hardware  size.
A) Concept  of size calculation
System sizing is to estimate  or calculate  a system’s  size using a mathematical  methodology,  based on actual
work and applications.  It can be defined as a lower-level  concept  of capacity  planning  or capacity  management  to
determine  performance  requirements  and performance  based on the system architecture  application,  as shown in
[Figure 81]. Sizing is temporarily  performed  for a specific  system  or server, and it is also called size estimation  because
it has a predictive  nature.

Sizing is a matter of prediction,  and the calculation  method significantly  affects the accuracy  of the calculation.
Hardware  size calculation  methods  are generally  classified  into the mathematical  calculation,  reference,  and simulation
methods,  as shown in [Figure 82]. It is necessary  to apply an appropriate  sizing method  to get accurate  sizing. This
guideline  uses a mathematical  calculation  method.  However,  it is necessary  to use all three methods  appropriately  for
size calculation,  in order to increase  the accuracy  of the calculation  results and objectivity.
