<Table 6> shows  how to solve the deadlock  state.
Table 6) Ways to Solve Deadlock  State
Condition Description
Prevention + It removes  the deadlock  causing  conditions  in advance.
Avoidance * It does not remove the condition  causing  the deadlock,  but avoids them.
Detection * It allows the deadlock  condition  to occur and finds its cause to resolve it.
+ It restarts  the deadlocked  process,  or restores  it into the original state in order to resolve  the

04 Memory  Unit Management
A) Understanding  of memory  unit management
A CPU uses scheduling  to improve  the utilization  rate as if multiple programs  share it at the same time. A CPU can
only execute  the instruction  and read data when they are stored in the memory.  Therefore,  multiple  processes  must
be stored in a memory  unit for them to run. Virtual memory  is the technique  of running  processes,  even if they are
not present  in the memory  unit. This technique  allows a user program  that is larger than the physical memory  unit to
run. This section  describes  various  techniques  for managing  the storage  unit.
B) Memory  unit management  technique
@ Memory  unit allocation  technique
It is the technique  of searching  for the best way to allocate processes  to the available  main memory  area when a
process  requests  the memory  unit for a new use. As shown in <Table 7>, the first-fit, best-fit,  and worst-fit  are the
generally  used techniques  for selecting  the available  areas from a set of available  areas.
{Table 7) Techniques  of Allocating  Memory  Unit
Type Description
+ It is a technique  of comparing  the request for the capacity  of the memory  unit and allocating
First-fit the first searched  space, which should be sufficiently  large. Using this technique  can make the
allocation  decision  quick, but it increases  fragmentation.
Best-fit + This technique  allocates  the smallest  available  space that can meet the required  memory  unit
capacity.  This technique  creates  another  smallest  available  space.
+ This technique  allocates  the largest  available  space. Since it allocates  the largest  available  space,
Worst-fit it can use the available  space better  than the best-fit  technique,  which can cause fragmentation
by creating  the smallest  available  space.
