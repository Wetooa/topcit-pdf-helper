@ Application  of a two-way  cipher  algorithm
Data, such as personal  information,  should be encrypted  and decrypted  using a two-way  cipher algorithm.
Secure block cipher algorithms,  such as SEED, ARIA, and AES (Rijndael),  are generally  used.
Currently,  there are two cases when the secure block cipher algorithm  should be applied:  when data is saved in
plain text in the existing  database,  and when an insecure  cipher algorithm,  such as DES or 3-DES, is used.
+ When data stored is in plain text
When personal  information  is stored in plain text, it should be encrypted  and stored, using a 128-bit  or higher
secret key, and the used secret key should be stored in a separate  safe place.

+ If an insecure  block cipher algorithm  is used
If an insecure  block encryption  algorithm,  such as DES or 3-DES, is used, the existing  encrypted  data
is decrypted,  using a batch job processing method, then encryption  is performed,  using a secure block
encryption  algorithm.
