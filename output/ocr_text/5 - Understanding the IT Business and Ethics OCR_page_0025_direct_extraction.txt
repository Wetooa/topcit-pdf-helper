inventory  levels continuously  based on information  gleaned  from the customers’  purchasing  data. The inventory  data
are sent to a process  that analyzes  real-time  customer  purchasing  patterns.  This pursuit  of production  efficiency  can
maximize  sales and contribute  significantly  to the building  of competitive  advantages.
Wal-Mart  is a case in point. The company  recorded  sales of more than $28 per unit area of the store (which is more
than double that of other retailers  (sales of $12 per unit area on average)  through  the use of its RetailLink  system,
which allows suppliers  to access  Wal-Mart's  data warehouse  directly.
@ Creation  of new business  values
Since the dawn of the twenty-first  century,  we have been seeing ever more examples  of new business  values being
created through  the application  of IT resources.  Apple completely  changed  the offline music distribution  structure
with its iTunes music store. The new online music distribution  structure  has created  a new business  value, and this is
considered  by many to have been the greatest  driver of Apple’s  growth  as a company.
E-commerce  is also another  example  of a new business  value created by IT resources.  The virtual online market  that
emerged  through  IT is changing  the traditional  concept  of commerce,  spawning  new concepts  of commerce  such as
open markets  and social commerce.
@ Expansion  of global business
Many companies  today are seeking new markets  and global businesses  to develop  for the sake of their survival
and prosperity.  The global cooperative  working  environment  enabled by IT resources  has presented  possibilities  for
exploring  new markets  to companies  that otherwise  would have kept their focus on local markets  only. The global
cooperative  working  environment  has challenged  traditional  ideas about the costs, labor, and time needed for
developing  global businesses.
For example,  the establishment  of videoconferencing  systems  has improved  decision-making  speed and efficiency
in the rapidly changing  business  environment,  while the ability to exchange  information  through Intranet  systems
without  the constraints  of time and space has given huge competitive  advantages  to global businesses.
C) Management  activities  and structure  for IT business
The IT business's cyclical management  activities  follow the traditional  PDCA management  cycle of planning,
execution,  checking,  and corrective  action. The Planning  (P) phase identifies  opportunities  and issues, sets the goals
and scope for IT business,  and establishes  an IT business  plan for linking business  with IT.
In the Do (D) phase, the IT business  is designed  and implemented  and the business  operations  data are collected.  In
theC (Check)  phase, the results of IT business  operations  are analyzed,  the business  and IT performance  indicators
are monitored,  and business  & IT correlation  verification  is carried out.
In the Action (A) phase, the improvements  needed are identified  and IT adjustments/modifications  are made to
support  the IT business,  after which the Planning  (P) phase begins all over again, completing  and continuing  the cycle
of repeat and renewal  ad infinitum.
