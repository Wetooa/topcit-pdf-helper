04 Concept  of ISP
A) Overview  of ISP (Information  Strategic  Planning)
The literal meaning  of the acronym  ISP is “Information  Strategy  Plan’. Generally,  the term “ISP establishment”  is used
more frequently  as an overarching  concept.
ISP can present  a vision for the information  system and information  management  structure  that can support  an
enterprise  or organization  when it is developing  its mid-to-long  term vision and goals and business  plan. In other
words, it can be understood  as a plan that provides  a rough sketch of the direction  of information  system deployment
to aid the enterprise  in realizing  its long-term  objectives.
B) ISP deployment  procedure
In order to deploy an ISP, the external/internal  environment  of the company  and the information  environment  must be
analyzed  first of all. When analyzing  the environment  of a company,  tools like SWOT, 5-Force,7S  and 4C are commonly
used. In addition,  when analyzing  the information  environment,  the technology  requirements  corresponding  to the
purpose  and background  of a project  must be reviewed  in detail by studying  the technology  trends and analyzing  the
application  of new technologies.
The next step consists  in analyzing  the current  operation  of the company.  The most important  item that must be
checked  in this analysis  is the business  process.  A careful study of the business  process in its current  state will reveal
various  factors  at work in a company  or an organization.
In addition,  analyzing  the information  systems  scattered  throughout  the company  and drawing  out the requirements
of stakeholders  and the improvement  agenda  are also important  tasks to be undertaken  at this stage. Also, through
the benchmarking  of earlier cases in the same or similar industries,  missing  or distorted  information  can be corrected
to some extent.
