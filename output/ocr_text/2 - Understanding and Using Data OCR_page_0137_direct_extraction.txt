>> Recent  trends and major issues
As the business  environment  has switched  from a seller-centered  model to a buyer-centered  model, ever
faster and more accurate  decision-making  is directly related to the survival of enterprises.  Accordingly,
analytical  systems  are needed  that support  a series of analysis  processes,  including  the collection,  storage,
processing,  presentation  and utilization  of data, in order to analyze enterprise  information  including
customers  more quickly and accurately.  In particular,  the data warehouse  (hereafter  referred  to as a “DW’)
for storing  large amounts  of corporate  information  accumulated  over time, the OLAP for diversely  analyzing
and utilizing  data from the user's perspective,  and data mining  for finding new business  insights  have been
introduced.
On the other hand, data warehouses  that were previously  available  for each area are now being replaced  by
the EDW (Enterprise  DW) due to the development  of large-scale  data storage  technology,  and semi-real-
time data warehouses  have also been introduced  due to the development  of data processing  technology.  In
addition,  as enterprises  are adopting  the Hadoop  system  for big data analytics,  its coexistence  with existing
analytics  data warehouses  is required.
