Step 3-4) ) On receiving  the packet  from user A’s computer,  wired/wireless  router B, aware
that the packet is not sent to the router as the final destination,  examines  the
address  to which the packet must be transmitted.  The IP header  indicates  that
the packet's  final destination  is myservercom,  and since it does not belong to
network  192.168.11.0  or 14.32.172.0,  to which wired/Wireless  router B belongs,  it
transmits  the packet  to router  C, to which it belongs  (routing  protocol).
On receiving  the packet, router C recognizes  that the packet is sent to
network  220.17.23.0,  to which the router belongs,  and intends  to transmit  it
to the webserver’s  IP address  220.17.23.15.  As in Step 3.3, since the packet
movement  in a network  requires  the physical  address  of my.server.com,  the
MAC address,  it obtains  the MAC address  corresponding  to the IP address
of my.server.com,  220.17.23.15,  though the network  broadcasting,  and
transmits  the packet  (ARP).
On receiving  the packet, my.server.com  examines  the IP address  and
recognizes  that the packet  was sent to it. It removes  the header  data, such as
the IP address,  and sends the remaining  data up to the higher  protocol  layer (IP).
It determines  which application  of my.server.com  to which the packet
should be transmitted,  removes  unneeded  data, and sends the remaining
data to the intended  webserver  application  (TCP).
