An initial packet  that contains  the information  for routing  between  networks  is created.
However,  it must be further  modified  to be transferred  between  networks.  The IPv4
address  of user A’s computer  is 192.168.11.5  and cannot be transmitted to my.server.
com directly. It must be transmitted  to the computer's  gateway  wired/wireless  router
B (192.168.11.1).  However,  an IP address  cannot be used for data transfer  in a network,
and the MAC address  is needed  for it. After finding the MAC address  corresponding  to
192.168.11.1,  the gateway’s  IP address,  the packet  is transmitted  to wired/wireless  router  B,
through  network  broadcasting.
Upon receiving  the packet, router C recognizes  that the packet  is sent to network  220.17.23.0,
to which the router belongs,  and intends to transmit  it to the webserver's  IP address
220.17.23.15,  AS is iniSi=e)ene),  since the packet movement  in a network  requires  the physical
address of my.server.com,  the MAC address,  it obtains the MAC address  corresponding  to
myserver.com’s  IP address,  220.17.23.15,  through  the network  broadcasting  and transmits  the
packet.
