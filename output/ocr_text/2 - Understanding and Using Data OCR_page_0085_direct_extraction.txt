Physical  design consists  of physical modeling  in which a logical data model is converted  into a physical
structure  (schema),  and a database  design process  in which an optimal object is created  by considering
the actual DBMS based on the physical  model. Many people misunderstand  physical  modeling  as a simple
process  of defining data type, length, and domain value, etc., but the data storage space, distributed
database  build, etc. are actually  decided.  Therefore,  physical  design is directly  related  to database  operation
performance.
