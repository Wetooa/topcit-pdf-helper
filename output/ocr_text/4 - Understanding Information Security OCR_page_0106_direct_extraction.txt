@ Restricting  the use of anonymous  FTP and using Secure FTP
Anonymous  FTP allows a malicious user to obtain information  about the system. Since various  attacks  can be
made if writing permission  is set in the directory,  the use of anonymous  FTP should be restricted  by setting
it in such a way that only necessary  users can gain access. Also, secure FTP should be used, rather than FTP
with weak security.
When using general FTP by using anonymous  FTP or by setting up an account,  there are security
vulnerabilities,  such as the transmission  of user authentication  information,  in plain text without  encryption,
and security  vulnerabilities  of the FTP protocol  itself, That is, FTP can acquire  account  privileges  by exploiting
the authentication  vulnerability  of the account  login and by applying  a brute force attack or a sniffing attack.
Therefore, when creating  an FTP program  for sending  and receiving  a file, an SFTP server should be installed
and an SFTP client program  should be written.
+ How to apply SFTP using Java
The SFTP open-source  library is used to create a SFTP client program using Java. Download  and install
Commons-Net  library from the Apache open-source  project site (http://commons.apache.org/proper/
commons-net/),  then write a SFTP client program  as follows:
// Import  libraries
import org.apache.commons.vfs2FileObject:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.FileSystemOptions:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.Selectors:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.impl.StandardFileSystemManager:
import org.apache.commons.vfs2.providersftp.SftpFileSystemConfigBuilder:
| FTP connection  and file download
StandardFileSystemManager  manager  = new StandardFileSystemManager();
String sftpUri = “sftp://  + userld + *:” + password  + “@” + serverAddress  + “/” +
remoteDirectory  + fileToF  TP;
FileObject  localFile  = managerresolveFile(file,getAbsolutePath());
FileObject  remoteFile  = managerresolveFile(sftpUri,  opts);
remoteFile.copyFrom(localFile,  Selectors  SELECT  _SELF);
