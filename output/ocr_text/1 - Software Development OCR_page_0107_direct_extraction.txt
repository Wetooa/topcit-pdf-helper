[Figure  23] Test level types
Software  testing requires  test plans and strategies  for each test level, which is a set of test activities
corresponding  to the development  stage. Specific  details, such as the test basis, test target, test approach,
tester or organization,  etc., which are the development  deliverables  to be referred to when identifying  the
goals of each test level and test case, should be defined.

B) Testing  techniques
Testing  techniques  are broadly  divided into white box testing  and black box testing,  which have the following
characteristics.
@ White box testing
+ White box testing  is called structural  or code-based  testing.
+ It is mainly used in unit testing  to find defects  in testable  software  (module,  program,  object, class, etc.) and
to verify the function  of them. The source code is used to perform control flow testing, condition/decision
coverage  testing,  and elementary  comparison  testing.
+ This technique  can be applied  to integrate  testing  using a structural  approach.
+ White box testing is divided into static analysis,  which is used to detect a pre-defined  error by analyzing  the
internal structure  of the implemented  source  code, and dynamic  analysis,  which is used to detect  an error
