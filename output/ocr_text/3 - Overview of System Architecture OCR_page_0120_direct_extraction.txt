Overview  of System Architecture )
@ System  implementation  direction  and basic data survey
+ Basic data on the tasks and system to be implemented  are necessary  to ensure the hardware  capacity  calculation
accuracy.  To get accurate  information,  cooperation  with the users is crucial, and the basic task analysis  and
implementation  direction  are establis|

ded workload,as  well as the relevance  and complexity  of each work, and
, through  the basic data and task analysis  results.
* Calculate  the reference  load by calculating  the sum of the expected  load for each task.
+ Validate  the basic data and task analysis.
@ Reference  model determination  and server size calculation
+ Select the reference  model suitable or the architecture  type of the calculation  target  system.
Architecture  Type Calculation  Condition Calculation  Criteria
Reference  model 1Processing  of all web, application,  and database
layers in a single serverServer  1: OLTP
Reference  model 2The web and application  layers processed  in server 1
and the database  layer processed  in server  2 or the
web layer processed  in serve 1 and the application
and database  layers processed  in server  2Server 1: Web/WAS
Server  2: OLTP
Reference  mode! 3The web layer processed  in server 1, the application
layer processed  in server  2, and the database  layer
processed  in server  3Server 1: Web/WAS
Server  2: Web/WAS
Server  3: OLTP
+ Select various  correction  coefficients,  based on the task analysis  data investigated  in Step 2.
+ Calculate  the size for each component  of the server in the reference  model.
@ Application  of weight  factor  for each reference  model
After the capacity  calculation  of each item of the server in Step 3, Step 4 applies the weight  factor for each server,
according  to the architecture  type.
E) Size calculation  method  for each hardware  component
This section describes  how to select the size for each server component.  As mentioned  in the section  for the
procedure  for size calculation,  determine  the server, based on the architecture  type, and calculate  the CPU, memory,
disk, and storage  sizes for each server.
Refer to “TTA Guidelines  on Calculating  Information  System  Hardware”  for how to calculate  the detailed  size of each
element.
