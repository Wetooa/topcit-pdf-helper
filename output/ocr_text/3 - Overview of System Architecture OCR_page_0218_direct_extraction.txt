SDN technology  standards.
@ Introduction  of SDN
SDN was first proposed  at the Open Network  Summit,  a conference  specializing  in SDN and open flow, held at
Stanford  University  in October  2010. SDN and OpenFlow  are technologies  that program and configure  or operate
networks,  like computers.  They have attracted  attention  as new innovative  communication environmental
technologies.  In March 2011, ONF (Open Networking  Foundation)  was formed  to promote  and standardize  OpenFlow
and SDN.
@ Concept  of SDN
As shown in [Figure 150], SDN enables  programming  networks  by separating  the control plane (to guide the network
to which it goes) from the data plane (to send packets  to a specific destination).  The basis of SDN is a switch that
uses industry  standard  control protocols,  such as OpenFlow,  and can be programmed  through  an SDN controller.

As shown in [Figure 151], the OpenFlow  technology  separates  the functions  to control and transfer  the packets  and
controls  the network  through programming.  OpenFlow  consists  of a controller  and a switch. The controller issues
commands  to the switch, and the switch performs  tasks related to data flow, such as sending  or modifying  packets
to the destination,  according  to the commands.
