@ Forward  Scheduling
The Early Start (ES) and Early Finish (EF) of each activity  are calculated,  and the formula  is as follows:
+ ES = EF of immediate  predecessor  activity  + 1
+ EF = ES of activity + activity  duration  - 1
<Table 44> Result of Forward  Scheduling  by Activity
Activity  Name ES (Early Start) Duration EF (Early Finish)
A 1 3 3(1 + 3-1)
B 4(3 + 1) 2 5(4 + 2-1)
c apa 2 9(8 + 2-1)
D 4(3 + 1) 4 7(4 + 4-1)
E 8(7 + 1) 6 13(8 + 6-1)
F 14(13 + 1) 3 16(14 + 3-1)
For Activity  “A’, there is no EF of predecessor  activity,  so ES starts with 1.
In the case of Activity  “C’, there are two predecessor  activities:  “B’ and “D’. In this case, as Activity  “C” can be
started after both “B” and “D” activities  are finished,  the EF of the immediate  predecessor  activity  used in the
ES calculation  is 7, which is the EF of Activity  “D’, which is then added with one to become  eight (7 + 1 = 8).
After calculating  all ES and EF for each activity,  fill in as shown in the figure below.

@ Backward  Scheduling
The Late Start (LS) and Late Finish (LF) of each activity  are calculated,  and the formula  is as follows:
+LS =LF of activity  - activity  duration  + 1
+ LF =LS of successor  activity  -
