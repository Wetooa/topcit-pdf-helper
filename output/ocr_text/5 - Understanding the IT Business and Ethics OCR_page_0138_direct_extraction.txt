unnecessary  elements  of regular  web pages for the sake of improving  the screen size, network  speed and quality, and
the user mode of the mobile devices  (the common  limitations  of the mobile environment); that is, they have begun
to focus more on the functions  that should be provided  on the mobile web. While responsive  webs typically  focus
on how changes  in layout and style take place from one device to another,  there also exist responsive  webs that
reconfigure  web contents  strictly  from a mobile  first perspective.

[Fig. 55] The responsive  web can configure  the same contents  in different  ways.
In addition  to the responsive  web, adaptive  web technology  is attracting  a lot of interest  as a technology  that enables
websites  to provide a seamless  transition  of information  for different  screen sizes. The adaptive  web is a server-
based or client-based  technology  that checks  the device that is trying to access the web. By using images tailored
for the device  of the user, the adaptive  web allows website  access  on a mobile device at high speeds.
© Semantic  web
Web that enables  intelligent  data processing  and the accumulation  of knowledge  through  the defining  and building  of
structured  data (ontology)  and data linking among  the structured  data is called semantic  web.
The web, which only displays  web documents  in HTML language,  has severe limitations  in expressing  resources,  and
the relationship  between  web documents  is defined. Hence computers  cannot understand  semantic.  Since there
are problems  in recognizing  all objects  with just URL alone, semantic  web was developed  as a way to efficiently  use
information  from distributed  webs, extract  meaningful  data from flood of information, and as a means for structuring
and interpreting  the huge amounts  of data produced  on the web.
