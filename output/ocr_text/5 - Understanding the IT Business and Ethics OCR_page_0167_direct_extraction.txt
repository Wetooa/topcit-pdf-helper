* 040(Online  for Offline)
040 means “Online for Offline” It means expanding  the scope of business  operations  from online to offline. An 040
service provider  drives market innovation  by operating  an offline business  by leveraging  the value provided to its
customers  online.
Amazon  Go is a shocking  example  that illustrates  the value and meaning  of O40. Why did Amazon  Go, an offline mart
that sells simple groceries  and miscellaneous  goods send such shockwaves  to the offline mart market?
To use Amazon  Go, customers  must activate  a mobile app and then log in. And then they just have to bring their
purchases  out of the store. Amazon  Go automatically  settles the bill through  the customer's  account  information
and delivers  the receipts  to the customer.  Of course,  customers  must be registered  with Amazon  Prime before using
Amazon  Go.
Customers  don't have to wait in line at the counter  to pay and don't have to go through  the process  of putting  the
goods on the counter  and packing  them in a grocery  bag. This is a very clear-cut  case O40 where an online company
leverages  their strengths  for customer  convenience.

In recent years, interest in cryptocurrency  has been hot due to the surge in the adoption  of crypto currencies  like
Bitcoin and Ethereum.  While under the strict definition,  it is correct  to call Bitcoin and Ethereum  cryptocurrencies,  the
term virtual currency  is often used instead.
