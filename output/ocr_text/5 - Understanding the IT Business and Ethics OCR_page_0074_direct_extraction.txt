B) Understanding  PI
@® Concept  of PI
Process  innovation  (PI) is the activity  of improving  the business  environment  to maximize  corporate  value. P| seeks to
eliminate  unnecessary  elements  (across  all aspects  of corporate  activities ranging  from business  process  to organization
and IT) and rebuild effective  business  processes,
Plis similar  to BPR, but it was introduced  in 1993 when David Port of the United States published  his paper titled ‘Process
Innovation’.  Pl can be understood  best as BPR, but with a greater  emphasis  on the integration  of information  technology.
The objective  of Pl is to build a structure  that can respond  to changes  in the business  environment  surrounding  an
enterprise  by improving  the current  business  processes  and the flow of information,  logistics  and values in a direction
that is more customer-centric.  Internationally,  the concept  of BPR developed by  Michael Hammer  is used widely.
But in South Korea, the concept  of Pl became  more popular  after it was first used by Samsung  Electronics  and after
POSCO adopted  a Pl-based  ERP as a strategy  for improving  its business  processes.  In South Korea, PI is used in a
broader  sense than BPR.
@ Example  of P| implementation  procedure
Generally,  Pl is implemented  in conjunction  with the deployment  of information  technology. A typical situation  is
when an enterprise  carries out sudden improvements  of its business  processes  through  integration  with ERP. The PI
develops  into a system that performs  improvements  to plans and processes,  establishes  an information  service plan,
and then realizes  the planned  items as a means of execution,  whether  ERP or CRM. The implementation  of Pl begins
with improving  the processes  and systems  of an enterprise,  after which an informatization  plan is established  through
the improved  systems  and processes,  followed  by the deployment  of a system that is capable  of executing  the plan
through  ERP or CRM.
