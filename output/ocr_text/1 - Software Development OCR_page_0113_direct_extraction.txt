01 Requirements  Management
A) Definition  of requirements  management
Requirements  engineering  can be largely divided into requirements  development  and requirements
management.  Requirements  development  consists  in defining  what to do, while requirements  management
consists  in checking  whether  the planned and defined requirements  are accurately  reflected  and in managing
changes  to the first requirements  on a continuous  basis.
B) Importance  of requirements  management
Proper requirements  management  should provide an effective  means  of communication  among the
stakeholders,  prevent  delivery  delays and going over budget through systematic  requirements management
from the initial phase of the project,  and execute  and manage  the user requirements  specification.
C) Purposes  of requirements  management
Requirements  management  aims to satisfy the customer’s  requirements  by understanding  them from the
customer's  point of view and to produce  high-quality  software  within  a limited schedule  and period.
D) Requirements  management  process
The figure below illustrates  the requirements  management  activities  in the entire software  development  life
cycle.
