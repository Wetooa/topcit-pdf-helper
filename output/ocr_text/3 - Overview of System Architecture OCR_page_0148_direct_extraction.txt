Overview  of System Architecture )
01 Concept  of Datalink  Layer
The datalink  layer transmits  data between  peripheral  devices  on the network,  using the physical  layer that transmits
signals  between  devices,  and is responsible  for address  allocation  and error detection.  The address  allocation  function
ensures  that devices  properly  receive  signals  from the physical layer on the network,  and the error detection  function
detects  whether  errors are included  in the transmitted  signals.
Application  software  developers  have no problem in programming  without  understanding  the datalink  layer and the
physical  layer. However,  a network  product  may need debugging  for cases where there is no network  connection  or
data error. If a product  uses various medium access control (MAC) layers, it may be necessary  to understand  each
standard  protocol.  Moreover,  developing  embedded  software  requires  a basic understanding  of drivers  since it may be
necessary  to develop  a driver. If the embedded  software  does not operate  normally  after the program  is ported to the
test environment  prepared  by the hardware  developer,  it is necessary  to perform debugging  to determine  whether
it is a hardware  or a software  problem.  The developer  needs to perform debugging,  using JTAG, or in the case of a
network  environment,  check whether  an error occurs in the actual physically  transmitted  bit and datalink  layer. As
short-range  wireless  communication  technologies,  such as Bluetooth  and ZigBee, have been recently  widely applied,
understanding  the datalink  layer has become  more important.
02 Encapsulation  of the Datalink  Layer
A) Encapsulation  of the datalink  layer
As shown in the following  figure, the datalink  layer frame adds a header  and a trailer to the network  layer packet.
This process is called encapsulation  of the datalink  layerThe  process is reversed  on the receiving  end and is called
decapsulation.

The frame header includes  a preamble  for bit synchronization  between  hosts, a start of frame delimiter (SFD) that
