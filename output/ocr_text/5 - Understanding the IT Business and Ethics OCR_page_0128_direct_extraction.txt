Disruptive  innovation  can be leveraged  as a strategy  for overcoming  the barriers to technological  innovation  and
reshape  future industries.  Enterprises  that are planning  disruptive  innovations  must clearly specify the target
technology  and its area of application,  and seek outside resources  in order to lay the foundations  for dominating
market  opportunities.
@ Crowdsourcing
As a composite  word coined by combining  ‘crowd’ and ‘outsourcing’,  crowdsourcing  is the concept  of opening  up all
phases of an enterprise’s  operations  to the participation  of consumers  and the general public alike. If the activities
of an enterprise  or its revenues  improve,  the revenue  is shared with the participants.  With the recent development
of SNS, companies  have been using social networks  a lot more, and crowdsourcing  has gained traction as an activity
that can generate  ideas by exploiting  the power  of the masses  using these new channels  of communication  with the
public.
Dell Computers  succeeded  in collecting  10,000 ideas during an 18-month  period after starting  a blog where
consumers  could exchange  business-related  technologies  directly. Like Dell, crowdsourcing  allows an enterprise  to
present  some very creative  ideas for solving  an enterprise  issue to a group of specialists.  The enterprise  can then
receive  help from the specialists,  which can then translate  into time or labor cost savings.
In recent years, crowdsourcing  services  have begun to partner up with professional  technology  brokerage  firms to
successfully  complete  diverse  types of crowdsourcing:  and, in the process,  they have begun to build an ecosystem
with a positive  virtuous  cycling  structure.
