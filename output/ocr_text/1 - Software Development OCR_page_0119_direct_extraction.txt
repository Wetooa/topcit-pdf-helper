The story of a development  team:
A certain project was commenced  with a deadline  of about three months,  but its
end was not visible even after two and a half months. Mr. Ko, the project manager,
also in charge of the architecture,  became increasingly  anxious with every passing
day. When the project was started, he thought  that three months  would be enough,
given its scale. That is why he didn’t create a separate  management  system -
because  four members  seemed few enough to engage in face-to-face  communication.
However,  about a month later he began to feel that the project had gradually  got
bogged down. Suddenly,  a team member  left the company  for health reasons and all
his tasks were stopped.  Mr. Ko hastened  to look for a replacement  to fill the position.
However,  the departed  member  had not created any proper documents,  so Mr. Ko
had to select one member  of his small team to train the new recruit for three days.
After that happened,  he hurriedly  began to list up the most immediate  requirements  and
the design deliverables.  Of course, listing those deliverables  was not included  in the project
period, so he had to work overnight  for almost a week to avoid delaying  the project.
After that, the project seemed to go well to some degree. However,  more serious
problems  occurred  after about two months.  After developing  the major functions  and
frameworks,  Mr. Ko was busy preparing  for a demonstration  for customers  because  it was
due soon. However,  his team was unlucky.  A team member's  computer  became infected
with a virus, and all the source codes and various scripts were erased in an instant.
The source of the calamity  was the method of deliverables  management.  That
is, the deliverables  were not centrally  managed.  Instead, only documents  were
managed  on the central file server, and the source code of each member  was
stored in the team’s PCs during development.  Until that happened,  each developer
was trusted to upload their source codes to the file server. The developer  who
lost all his source codes due to  a virus infection  was the least diligent  of them.
The team members  had to work overnight  again for couple of days to update
the latest source code uploaded  to the file server. During that period, the
customers’  trust was wearing  thinner and thinner. When the developed
system began to be delivered  to the customers,  they made various requests,
and the development  team began to modify the source code on demand.
