ITIL v3 consists  of 5 process  areas. This 5-step process  of continuous  service improvement  (Service  Strategy  >
Service Design — Service Implementation  — Service Operations)  is a continuous,  repeated  cycle. In particular,  the
performance  evaluation  (ROI) area was strengthened  in ITIL v3 because  it was deficient  in v2. By reflecting  the
performance  results back into service  strategy,  ITIL v3 further  strengthens  the IT service  capabilities  of an enterprise.
