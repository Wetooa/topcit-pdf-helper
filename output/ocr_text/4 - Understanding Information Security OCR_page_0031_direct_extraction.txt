restored  using the hash  value. That is, the original  text cannot be restored  through computation  using the hash
value.
Therefore,  the hash function  is mainly used to safely store sensitive  data, such as the password,  buta bypass
attack can be made using hash collision, which outputs  the same output  for two different  input values.
© Types of hash functions
+ MD5(Message  Digest Algorithm  5)
MD5 is a 128-bit hash function  used for testing the integrity  of the program  or file. It was designated  as
RFC 1321 of the IETF. However,  it is recommended  to use a safer algorithm  like SHA-2 for hashing  purposes,
because  several important  defects  were found.
MDS is frequently  used for saving  a password.  The result  of hashing  a password  with MDS is saved. Therefore,
a server operator  or a third party cannot know the original password  using the hash result value of the
password  only stored in the system. If the user correctly  inputs the password,  the same hash value is
returned,  confirming  that the password  is correct.
+ SHA (Secure  Hash Algorithm)
MD5, which was developed  from SHA, means  a set of interlinked  hash functions.  It was first designed  by the
National  Security  Agency  (NSA) in 1993,and  it was designated  as the national standard  in the U.S. It is also
called SHA-O to distinguish  the first function  from the functions  designed  later. SHA-1, a variant of SHA-O,
was announced  two years later. Subsequently,  four more variants  were released,  such as SHA-224,  SHA-256,
SHA-384,  and SHA-512.  These are called SHA-2 as a group. Currently,  SHA-3, which is completely  different
from SHA-1 and SHA-2, is under development,  and it was confirmed  as SHA-3 in 2012.
SHA-0 and SHA-1 have a hash value of 160 bits, and SHA-224/256/384/512  provide a hash value of
224/256/384/512  bits, respectively.  In addition,  it is recommended  to use a hash function  of SHA-256  or
higher for safety. On the other hand, an attack on SHA-2 has not yet been reported,  but there is a possibility
of an attack because  SHA-2 functions  use a method  similar  to that of SHA-1.
@® Supplementing  hash functions
Salt is an arbitrary  bit string that is added when  a hash function  generates  a hash value. Salting  is to generate
a hash value by adding  a bit string to the original message.  For example,  a hash value can be created by adding
salt “topcit”  to the password  “@Kr5792cc’.
as shown in [Figure 11].

When the salting method is used, an attacker  cannot check whether  the password  matches  the salted hash
