@ Network  security  model
A computer  network  consists  of communication  objects,  such as computers  and communication  systems  (a set
of transmission  devices and communication  lines). The computer  network  exists to support  data transmission
between  the sending  computer  and receiving  computer,  regardless  of the distance.
{Figure 55] is an abstract  expression  of network  communication  elements  from the perspective  of security.
A single message  is sent from the sender to the receiver  through a network,  like the Internet.  Two
communication  subjects  should cooperate  with each other to exchange  messages  in this process.  A logical
information  channel (a path consisting  of numerous  communication  devices  is allocated  between  the sending
computer  and the receiving  computer,  which is used to transfer  data) is established  by setting the Internet
path between  the message  source and destination,  negotiating  between  the two communication  subjects.
If transmission  data needs to be protected  from attacks  on confidentiality  and authentication,  corresponding
security  measures  are started.  All mechanisms  for security  should include  the following  two elements:
* Conversion,  related to the security of  the data to be sent, belongs  to this. For example,  encryption  that
mixes messages  to prevent  attackers  from understanding  the message  or adding a code (hash code), based
on the message  content  to identify  the sender, belong  to this.
+ For example,  encryption  keys belong  to this, which are used to convert  the message  (confidential  information
shared by two communicating  subjects  that is unknown  to the attacker)  before sending  it, and to convert  it
again after receiving  the message.

A trusted  third party may be needed for secure transmission.  For example,  a third party may distribute  secret
information,  such as encryption  keys, to both communication  subjects  to prevent  attackers  from knowing  it or
may mediate  a dispute  when it occurs.
A general network  security  model should meet the following  four basic conditions  when designing  a specific
security  service:
+ Design should be an algorithm  design that performs  conversion  related to security.  An attacker  should not be
