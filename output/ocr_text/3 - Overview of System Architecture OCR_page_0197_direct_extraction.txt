[Figure 139] Virtual Scenario  of Application  Layer Operation
This section describes  the part related to the HTTP protocol  in [Step 1] and [Step 3-4] of the network
operational  procedure  in user A’s web usage scenario  @ in “l. Network  concept”. A web browser  and an
application  program  are connected  to the web server program,  httpd, through  a TCP connection  and plays
the role of fetching  the web content  that is desired by user Athen converting  it into a user-friendly  form.
The web browser  uses the HTTP/1.1  protocol  for communication  with the webserver.  The HTTP/1.1  protocol
is a text-based  application  layer protocol [8]. Text data created, according  to the HTTP/1.1 protocol,  is
delivered  to the other application  layer program  through  the transport  layer protocol.
The application  layer program uses socket programming  to transmit  and receive user data through  the
transport  layer. Socket programming  is a programming  technique  that is crucial for implementing  the
application  layer protocol,  but it is out of the scope of this guide's  contents.  Refer to other books for more
details.
