There are some cases in which a set of operations  executed  in a database  is viewed is viewed as a unit
from the viewpoint  of the database  user. For example,  transferring  money from account  A to account  B
may look like a single operation  at first glance. However,  the transaction  is internally  composed  of two
update operations,  ie. changing  the balance  of account  A and changing  that of account  B, respectively.
What if this operation  fails in the middle of processing,  and the balance  of account  A has been changed
while that of account  B remains unchanged?  If any operation  fails, all operations relating  to the account
transfer  task should be either performed normally  as a whole or returned  to the original state prior to
the operations.  As explained  previously,  a set of operations  that constitute  a logical work unit is called
a “transaction”.  The important  thing here is that all operations  of the transaction  should be completely
executed  or returned  to the original state before any transaction  if an error occurs.
What if the update of the data shared between  transactions  cannot be controlled  in a database  system
that executes  several transactions  simultaneously? For  example,  what happens  if you transfer  KRW 1,000
online from an account  with a balance  of KRW 1,000 and withdraw  KRW 1,000 from an ATM at the same
time? In reality, it is naturally  impossible,  because  the database  system controls  these transactions.  As
explained  so far, the database  system provides  a concurrency  control method  to secure the isolation  of a
transaction,  which ensures  that the transaction  is not affected  by the change  made by another  transaction
at the same time. However,  if the level of transaction  isolation  is high, simultaneous  access  to the database
(concurrency)  becomes  difficult  and performance  is negatively  affected.  Therefore,  the isolation  level should
be selected  appropriately  by considering  the nature of the transaction.
In fact, service failure occurs frequently  in the field due to the problem  with concurrency  control, including
the case of the college course registration  crisis that occurred  due to the application  of the isolation
level of the banking  system,  which requires strict transaction  isolation,  to the college course registration
system.  Therefore,  the concept  of transaction  and concurrency  control should be correctly  understood  to
determine  the “appropriate”  level of the system  to be developed  and transaction  isolation.
