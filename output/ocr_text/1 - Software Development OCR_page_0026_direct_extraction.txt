C) Software  development  phases
Software  development  activities  are defined  by the software  lifecycle.
@ Requirements  analysis
+ The hardest  thing in software  development  is deciding  exactly  what to develop.
+ Software  requirements  analysis is practically  the first step in software  development  and is the phase of
understanding  what the user needs.
+ Itis a critical phase that can reduce the development  costs in the entire development  phase.
+ If investment  is channeled  into analyzing,  defining  and managing  the requirements  well in the early stages,
the entire software  development  period can be shortened  and excessive  costs and quality deterioration  can
be prevented  in advance.
@ Design
+ The software  requirements  analysis  process  is a conceptual  step, whereas  the design process  is the first step
in physical  realization.
+ When designing  a system,  the structure  of a system,  which is composed  of sub-systems,  is determined,  and
sub-systems  are allocated  to the components,  such as hardware  or software.
+ Design directly  affects  quality.
+ If a system  is not designed  properly,  its stability  deteriorates.
+ Unstable  systems  are difficult  to maintain
@® Implementation
+ The goal of the software  implementation  phase is to program it in a way that the requirements  can be
satisfied based on the design specification.
+ The program  should be written according  to the description  in the detailed  design and user’s guide.
* One of the most important  tasks in the implementation  phase is to decide on a coding standard  and write
the code clearly based on that standard.
