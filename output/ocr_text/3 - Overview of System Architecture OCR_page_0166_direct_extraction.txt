04 Network  Service  Quality
A) Quality  of Service  (QoS) characteristics
QoS is the technology  of guaranteeing  a service quality and performance  of a communication  service  to meet user
requirements,  The attributes  to determine  the QoS include confidence,  delay, jitter, and bandwidth,  as shown in
<Table  45>.
{Table 45) QoS Measurements
Attribute Description
Confidence - An attribute  needed by a flow in order to deliver a packet safely to the destination
Delay - Adelay  when transmitting  a packet from the transmitting  side to the receiving  side
Jitter - Variation  of delay for packets belonging  to the same flow
Bandwidth - The maximum  rate available  in communication,  i.e. the ability to transmit  information
B) Quality  implementation  technique
® Scheduling
Routers  are responsible  for handling  packets  over the Internet.  Therefore,  the packet  flow can differ, according  to the
schedule.
<Table 46) Packet Scheduling  Methods
Scheduling  Method Description
FIFO queuing - The basic Internet  scheduling  method  delivers  packets  in the order of their arrival.
ra . - The method  assigns  a priority  to each transferred  packet and handles  the packet  with higher
Priority  queuing . .
priority  first.
- The method  assigns  a priority  class to packets,  and packets  are assigned  to each priority  queue.
Weighted  fair queuing - It selects  a queue in the form  of a round-robin,  and the packets  in the selected  queue are delivered.
The number  of packets  delivered  varies, according  to the weight  of the queue.
@ Traffic shaping  and traffic policing
As a way to control the traffic speed and volume,  traffic shaping  is used when the traffic leaves the network, and
traffic policing  is used when the traffic enters  the network.
Table 47) Traffic Shaping  and Traffic Policing
Traffic  Shaping/Policing Description
Meaty bucket - The burst input packets  are  stored ina bucket  and output at an average  speed.
- The packets  can be discarded  if the input packets  exceed the bucket  size.
Token bucket ~ The basic algorithm  used by traffic shaping  and policing
@ Resource  reservation
It is the method  of reserving  resources,  such as buffer, bandwidth,  CPU, and time needed for data flowfor a specific
service  to ensure the service  quality.
