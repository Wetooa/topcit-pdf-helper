F) Hash function
@® Concept  of the hash function
A hash function,  or a hash algorithm,  is a mathematical  function  that outputs  a short hash value (hash code)
with a fixed length from random data of various sizes, as shown in Figure 10. That is, the hash function
compresses  an input string with a random length into a string with a fixed, short length. For example,  HAS-160
(Hash Algorithm  Standard  160), SHA-1 outputs  a 160-bit  result.

[Figure 10] Hash function
The cryptographic  algorithm  uses keys, but the hash function  does not use keys. Therefore,  the same input
always produces  the same output. The hash function  with this characteristic  is used to verify the integrity  that
detects  the error in or tampering  of the message  by extracting  the unalterable  evidence  value for the input
message.
@ Properties  of the hash function
Since the operating  algorithm  of the hash function  is simple, it is easy to calculate  h(x), when function  h and
input x are given, and system resources,  such as a CPU and memory,  are consumed  relatively  less. Also, the
hash function  should have the basic properties  described  in <Table 5> from the aspect  of stability.
<Table 5> Basic properties  of the hash function
Property Characteristics
Pre-image  resistance + When y is given, it is difficult  to find x where h(x)=y.
2nd pre-image  resistance * Given h(x)=y, it is difficult  to find x where h(x’)=y  (however,  x#x’).
Collision  resistance + It is difficult  to find x and x’ (however,  x#x’) where h(x)=h(x’)
The hash function is widely used in the security  field because  of its characteristic  that the original  text cannot be
