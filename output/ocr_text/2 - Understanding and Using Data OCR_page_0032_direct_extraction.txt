Database )
* It is difficult  to perform  unexpected  random  search.
@ Network  database
A network  database  stores data by expanding  the tree form of a hierarchical  database  into a network  form. Pointers
are used to maintain  a many-to-many  relationship  between  records  and to link data.
The major characteristics  of the network  database  are as follows.
+ It was developed  in the early 1970s to solve the problems  with the hierarchical  database.
+ Data can be extracted  quickly  and effectively  by adding  links between  hierarchical  structures.
+ High maintenance  costs and backlog  are entailed  by the complex  type system.
+ Programmers  must understand  the structure  to write a program.
+ A record can have pointers  to children and sibling records and to parent  records, which was not possible  with the
hierarchical  database.
@ Relational  database  (RDB)
The relational  database  is based on the relational  data model proposed  by E.F. Codd in the 1970s. Major commercial
products  include  Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Informix,  Sybase,  and Ingres.
Characteristics  of the relational  database
+ The model itself is simple.  The database  stores characters/numbers/date  information  in a two-dimensional  structure
(column,  row).
* The model is based on mathematical  theory - particularly  the set theory of mathematics.  Therefore,  the
performance  of the system to be developed  can be predicted  and verified mathematically,  and various operations
can be mathematically  optimized.
+ Existence  of query language  - Anyone  can easily search for desired information  by leaming  a simple query language
in the 4GL format.
+ Contiguous  support  for technology  that keeps pace with the circumstances  of the times - Supports  the client/
server architecture,  large-scale  parallel processing,  etc.
@ Object-oriented  database  (OODB)
The relational  database  cannot create new types of data or expand existing  types, and has difficulty  processing
unstructured  complex  information  such as multimedia. Also, the standard  query language  “SQL” expresses  data
relationships  by values, making  it difficult  to find and process mutually related entities when expressing  a complex
object. Accordingly,  a database  that can search and store information  based on an object model emerged,  namely,
the object-oriented  database.  Major commercial  products  include ObjectStore,  O2, Objectivity,  and Uni-SQL.
The object-oriented  database  has the following  characteristics,
+ User-defined  data types are supported,  and inheritance  can be specified.
+ Unstructured  complex  information  can be modeled.
+ Information  can be accessed  based on navigation  using the reference  structure  between  objects.
+ The structure  of information  in the program  is also same as that of the database  schema.
However,  the object-oriented  database  was not distributed  widely in the market because  its basic database
management  functions  were found to be weak, such as transaction  processing,  number  of supported  concurrent
users, backup  and recovery,  etc., and system safety and performance  were never proven in an enterprise  environment.
