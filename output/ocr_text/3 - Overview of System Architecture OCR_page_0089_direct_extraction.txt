@ Data de-duplication
The technology  provides  a high efficiency  of disk space used by removing  any duplicated  data when saving the data.
The removal methods  include  an inline method,  which immediately  removes  redundant  data as it enters the storage
system,  and an offline method,  which removes  the redundant  data after storing  the new data.
E) Storage  disk scheduling
@ Disk scheduling
A disk drive that stores data is a device using a rotating  magnetic  disk. When inputs and outputs  are requested  to this
disk drive, the system performance  varies significantly,  according  to which request  is processed  first, and the process
in moving  the head to access the data. Disk scheduling  is a technique  of efficiently  processing  I/O requests,  when
multiple  users request  them, in order to process  different  tasks. Using disk scheduling  has the following  purposes:
- Maximization  of I/O requests  to service  during  a unit time
- Maximization  throughput  per unit time
- Minimization  of the mean response  time
- Minimization  of response  time
- Minimization  of the variation  of response  time
@ Disk performance  measurement  indicator
Disk scheduling  can be compared  with the indicators  that measure  disk performance.  Disk performance  measurement
indicators  include the access  time, seeking  time, rotational  delay or rotational  latency,  and data transfer  time.

[Figure 59} Disk  Performance  Measurement  Indicators
The seeking  time indicates  how long it takes to move the head from the current head position,  to the track
containing  the data. The rotational  latency  indicates how long it takes from the moment  the head begins rotating  to
move to the track containing  the data, to the moment  it reaches  the sector  that contains  the data.
Seeking  time is the time it takes to move the head from the current head position,  to the track containing  the data.
Recent  disk drives minimize  the rotational  latency  by having an internal  buffer, and by storing  all the data in the track
