Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
due to a combination  of factors at play such as the technology  development  levels and the economic  conditions.  In
recent years, buzzwords  describing  a completedly  connected  world (M2M, loT and Internet  of Everything)  are being
discussed  so much that it has become  rather  diffcult  to distinguish  the difference  between  such words.The  difference
between  the approaches  taken by M2M and loT is in how connections  are made. As mentioned  earlier, as M2M
evolved  in each industry  sector, it became  specialized to the particular  sector it served. loT is the effort to connect
these disparate  M2M technologies  under the universal  communication  network  umbrella  we call the Internet  so that
businesses  could offer more diverse and dynamic  services.  There are many different  perspectives  to M2M, but if they
are grouped  by different  types of services,  some of the typical examples  can be listed as follows.

Global loT is presently  in the introduction  phase or early growth  phase of its technology  life cycle. But it is expected
to grow more than 20% annually  to reach $1.2 trillion by 2022, and it will create new value by reducing  the transaction
costs between  the physical  world and the digital world. Ultimately,  loT will eventually  improve  productivity  and give
birth to new markets. Due to the market's  desire to value connectivity  and technological  innovation,  the market  will
push loT to transform  itself into a mobile centric  network  where information  can be accessed  anytime  and anywhere.
The increasing  speed of network  connectivity  and the market penetration  of different  types of mobile devices and
connection  technologies have triggered  the generation  and sharing of much more data than before. Consequently,
loT is being applied even to the process  and analysis  of Big Data. In addition,  the accumulation  of product  knowledge
in the market, increased  use, and the process  of connecting  are encouraging  the market to change itself from a
supplier  market  to a buyer's market. This trend will have a significant  impact on the development  direction  of future
technologies  and products.
The functions  expected  to drive the growth of the loT industry  include  optimization  function,  function  for integrating
with other social infrastructures that transcends  industries,  and function  for managing  social infrastructures.  These
functions  may contribute  to greater  social benefits,  such as improving  the efficiency  of social infrastructure  or
responding  to echoes,  rather  than improving  personal  convenience.
