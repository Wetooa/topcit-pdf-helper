@ Requirements  for a secure digital signature  algorithm
+ Forgery  prevention:  Anyone  other than a legitimate  signer shouldn't  be able to forge the signature.
+ User authentication:  The signer should be identifiable  from the electronic  signature.
+ Non-repudiation:  The signer should not be able to deny that the signer has signed the document.
+ Alteration  prevention:  A signed document  should not be changeable.
+ Reuse prevention:  A signature  for one document  cannot  be reused as a signature  for another  document.
© Operation  of the electronic  signature
The operation  of the digital signature  consists  of six phases  as shown in <Table 9>.
<Table  9> Operation  procedure  of the electronic  signature
Order Description
Phase 1 The sender  generates  a message  digest, a fixed-length  string, by applying  a hash algorithm  to the message
to be sent.
Phase 2 The sender  creates  an electronic  signature  by encrypting  the created message  digest using the sender's
private key.
Phase  3 The sender  sends a message  and digital signature  to the receiver.
The receiver  extracts  the message  digest  generated  by the sender, by decrypting  the received  digitalPhase 4 : . : -
signature  using the sender's  public key.
Phase 5 The receiver  generates  a new message  digest by applying  the same hash algorithm  as the sender  to the
received  message.
Phase 6 The receiver  compares  the message  digest received  from the sender,  with the receiver's  message  digest. If
they are the same, it is regarded  as the electronic  signature  of the legitimate  sender.
E) PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
© Definition  of PKI
PKI is an infrastructure  for managing  the public key, which is an essential  element  for encryption  and
authentication  required  for secure transactions.  This infrastructure  safely distributes  encryption  and decryption
keys, as well as certificates  that provide information  security  services.  PKI is a network  structure  of objects
that sets up and provides  policies, means, and tools, which makes the use of certificates  and encrypted
communication  easy in various application  fields that require secure communication,  such as information
system  security  and electronic  commerce.
@ PKI components
As shown in <Table 10>, the PKI is composed  of the policy approval  authority  (PAA), policy certification
authority  (PCA), certification authority  (CA), registration  authority  (RA), and public certificate.
