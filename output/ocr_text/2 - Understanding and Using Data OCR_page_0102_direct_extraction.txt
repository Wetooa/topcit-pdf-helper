01 Understanding  the Concept  of Relational  Algebra
Relational  algebra is largely divided into relational  algebra and relational  calculus.  Unlike relational  analysis,  which is a
non-procedural  language  that defines  desired information, a relation  operation  has the characteristic  of a procedural
language  because  it specifies  the order of operations  to be performed in order to obtain desired information.  In
particular,  as relational  algebra becomes  the theoretical  basis for SQL, the standard  query language  of relational
databases,  the concept  and principle  of relational  algebra need to be clearly understood.  Therefore,  this module
introduces  set operation  and relation  operation,  which constitute  the basic relational  algebra, and the extended
relational  algebra  operation.
O2 Set Operation  and Relation  Operation
Relational  algebra is a set of operations  for processing  relations  in a relational  database  and all operands  of each
operation,  and the result of the operation  is relations.  Basic relational  algebra operations  are usually divided into set
operations  and relation  operations.
A) Set operation
Set operators  include  Union, Intersect,  Difference,  and Cartesian  Product.

@ Operator @ Sign @ Description
. + A binary operation  to create a relation  that is composed  of tuples, which belong  toUnion U . ;more than one relation  among  two relations  that can be merged.
+ A binary operation  to create a relation  that is composed  of tuples, which belong  to bothIntersect n ;of the two relations  that can be merged.
Direrence . + A binary operation  to create a relation  that is composed  of tuples, which exist in one
relation  but not in the other when there are two relations  that can be merged.
Cartesian  product x “A binary  operation  to create arelation  that is composed  of a combination  of tuples,
which can be configured  with two relations.
B) Relation  operation
Relation  operators  include  Select, Project,  Join, and Division.

+ Aunary  operation  in which a specific  tuple which satisfies  the condition  is separated  from a
Select 0 relation.
+ A horizontal  subset  is taken from one relation.
+ Aunary  operation  in which a specific  attribute  is elected  and separated  from a relation.
+ A vertical  subset  is taken from one relation.Project 1
