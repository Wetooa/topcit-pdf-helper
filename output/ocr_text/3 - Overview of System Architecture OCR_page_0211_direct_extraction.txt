>p> Recent  trends and issues
As high-speed  data transmission  becomes  possible  and various  convergence  technologies  emerge,  cutting-
edge technologies  are also appearing  in the network  field. With the advent  of technologies  that guarantee
traffic quality in Internet networks, multimedia  and Internet  telephony  services  have been launched.  In
recent years, loT network-based  technologies  are expanding  together  with standardization  organizations
and groups. Moreover,  software-based  networks,  differentiated  from the existing  network  structure,  are
being introduced.  This chapter  discusses  the recent  network  trends and major issues.
