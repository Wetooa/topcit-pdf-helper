01 Software  Reuse
A) Overview  of software  reuse
The term “software  reuse” means to develop new software  using existing  software  or software  knowledge.
Reusable  software  or software  knowledge  is a reusable  asset comprising  design, requirements,  inspection,  and
architecture.
@ Background  to software  reuse
+ Deterioration  of quality and productivity  due to a software  crisis.
+ Increased  use of CASE tools due to the development  of automation  technology  in software  development.
+ Efforts  to comply  with software  development  standardization  and secure quality.
@ Definition  of software  reuse
+ Software  reuse is a method of standardizing  knowledge  about software development  (function,  module,
configuration,  etc.) and configuring  it to be suitable for repeated  use in order to increase  development
productivity.
+ Countermeasures  that increase  the quality, productivity,  and reliability  of newly developed  software and
reduce the development  schedule  and cost by reusing  all or a part of software  that has been recognized  for
its development  functions,  performance,  and quality.
+ A concept  whereby  developed  modules,  programs  and deliverables  are directly reused or reused after some
modifications  in the same application  field, or are reused for different  application  duties or by different
companies
@ Purpose  of software  reuse
Goal Contents
Responsibility Performance  such as functions,  stability,  speed, etc. has already  been proved.
Scalability Easy to upgrade  based on proven functions.
Productivity Improvement  of the overall development  process, such as cost, time, risk, etc.
B) Target  of software  reuse
Various  subjects  can utilize software  reuse.
@ General  knowledge
+ Environmental  information:  Knowledge  obtained  through  education  and use.
+ External  knowledge:  Knowledge  obtained  by participating  in the development  and the specific  field.
@ Design information
+ System  architecture
+ System  design
