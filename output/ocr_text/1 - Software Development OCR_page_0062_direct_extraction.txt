B) Transaction  flow-oriented  design
A “transaction”  is said to occur when data, control signal, etc. trigger an action. Transaction  flow-oriented
design can be used when received  input can be split into multiple  output flows. A transaction  evaluates  the
input value and flows the result along one of several output paths depending  on the result. The center  of the
information  flow in this case is called the transaction  center. The figure below shows this characteristic,  and
the bubble  T is the transaction  center.

If the data flow diagram  has a transaction  flow, the location  of the transaction  center should be clarified  first.
The transaction  center receives  a transaction  as an input and connects  it to several  output bubbles.  Therefore,
the transaction  center  has one input path and multiple  output  paths. Each operation  path (output  path) can be
composed  of several bubbles  and can have  a transform  flow or a transaction  flow.
Based on this, a program  structure based on transactions  can be created. Such a structure consists  of three
components.
+ Amodule  that acts as a transaction  center.
+ A module  that receives  an input.
* One or more modules  corresponding  to each operation  path.
The figure below shows the structure  of the program  structure  based on transactions.
