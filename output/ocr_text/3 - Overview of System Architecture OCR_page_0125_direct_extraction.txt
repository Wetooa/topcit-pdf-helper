B) HA configuration  type
@ Hot standby  (Active-standby)
Hot standby  is the simplest  structure  of HA clustering  implementation.  It consists  of an active server and a standby
server  that are normally  in a standby  state. The standby  server is powered  on, and the operating  system is running.
In some cases, a standby  server is used as a development  system.  If the active server  fails, due to hardware,  network,
or process  problem,  the failure is detected  by the heartbeat  network,  and all HA service  operations  are automatically
switched  to the standby  server, through  a fail-over  operation.
