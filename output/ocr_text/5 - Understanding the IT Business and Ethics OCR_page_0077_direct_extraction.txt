@ Six Sigma implementation  methodology
The Six Sigma implementation  methodology  can be separated  into the design program  and the manufacturing
program.  The design program  uses the DMADV  methodology,  while the manufacturing  program  uses the DMAIC
methodology.  Another  characteristic  is that the design program  is focused  on preventing  errors and defects,  whereas
the manufacturing  program  is focused  on reducing  defects  and preventing  recurrences.
<Table  28> Six Sigma implementation  methodology
Program Descriptioni
| + The design program  is for designing  a process  that surpasses  the core requirements  and the customers’
Design program expectations.  The design program is focused on preventing  errors and defects. It is suitable for
(DMADV) developing  new products  or processes,  and for redesigning  existing products or processes.
- (Define)  Establish  the goals of design activities  that satisfy  the requirements  put forth by users.
- (Measure)  Select  factors  that impact  quality in a critical  way.
- (Analyze)  Assess  the feasibility  of the design and conduct  analysis  for development  of the best design.
- (Design)  Detailed  agenda,  optimize  design, and plan for design verification.
- (Verify)  Activate  testing  of the design and verify the application  of the product  development  process.

+ The manufacturing  program  makes repetitive  improvements  while focusing  on reducing  defects  to the
M : levels required  by manufacturing,  production  and mass production.  The manufacturing  program  alsoanufacturing . onprogram improves  existing  products  and processes.
(DMAIC) - (Define) Define the problem,  set the goals, and estimate  CTQ(Critical  to Quality).
~ (Measure)  Select theitems  for measurement,  establish  the method  of measurement,  and analyze  the
current  status,
- (Analyze)  Analyze  the causal relationship  of the identified  problem  and determine  the root cause.
~ (Improve)  Derive  the optimal  method  for eliminating  the root cause and improving  manufacturing.
- (Control)  Prevent  recurrence,  maintain  the improved  condition,  and analyze  the effects  of
improvements.
D) Understand  TRIZ
© Overview  of TRIZ
TRIZ is a systematic  methodology  for solving  the problem  of invention,  which was developed  in the Soviet Union by
Genrich  Altshuler  In the 1940s, Genrich  Altshuller  worked  for the Soviet Navy as a patent examiner.  He discovered
that there were some common  rules and patterns  in inventions.  Out of 1.5 million patents  worldwide,  50,000 creative
patents  were extracted  and analyzed,  resulting  in four important  discoveries  which are summarized  in the table below.
<Table 29> Four important  discoveries
Discovery Explanation
Definition  of invention  problem + The invention  problem  has at least one contradiction
Level of invention + There are 5 levels of invention.
