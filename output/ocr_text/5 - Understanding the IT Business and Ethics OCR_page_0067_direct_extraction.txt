B) Business  process
An enterprise  is a formal organization  whose objective  is the pursuit  of profits through  the sale of goods or services
at prices higher  than the costs required  to produce  them.
Furthermore,  an enterprise  can be viewed as a collection  of interrelated  business  functions  (or activities)  defined by
various business  rules with the aim of realizing  some objectives.  Here, the term “business  rules” refers to the rules
that determine  when, how, in what order, and which rules should be applied. Business  rules (ie. processes)  have a
significant  impact  on an organization's  management,  performance,  and value creation.
The step of describing  the method and the job of organizing  work in an enterprise  is called the “business  process”.
Examples  of common  business processes  by function  (such as manufacturing  and production,  sales and marketing,
finance,  and HR management)  are described  in the table below.

customer  encounters  a problem with the multifunctional  printer he/she has been using, he/she requests  a repair
service by contacting  the customer  center. The center assigns  a member  of the service personnel if a visit to the
customer's  site is deemed  to be warranted. The service personnel  assigned  to the task talks to the customer  to
determine  the symptoms  and schedule  the visit.
