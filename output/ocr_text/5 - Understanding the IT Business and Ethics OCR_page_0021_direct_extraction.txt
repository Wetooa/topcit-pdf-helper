Revolution  not only accelerated  the convergence  of the IT industry  but also affected  other industries,  acting as a
catalyst  for the overall “smartification”  of entire industries.
Overall smartification  has resulted  in IT technology  being adopted  by such diverse  sectors  as education,  automobiles,
