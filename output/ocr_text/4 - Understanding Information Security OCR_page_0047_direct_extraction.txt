© CL (Capability  List)
Based on the subject,  the rights to access the object are managed  in a linked list format. The list corresponds
to the row of the access  control matrix.
@® SL (Security  Label)

E) Access  control  models
@ Bell-Lapadula  model
The first mathematical  model that was designed,  with the support  of the U.S. Department  of Defense,  as an
access control model (MAC policy) based on compulsory  policies.  This model emphasizes  confidentiality.  It puts
emphasis  on secret leakage  prevention,  rather than illegal information  destruction  or alteration,  and it prevents
information  from flowing  from the high level to the low level.
@ Biba model
A model designed  to guarantee  integrity,  which is the shortcoming  of the Bell-Lapadula  model (however,
confidentiality  is not guaranteed).  This model deals with integrity  as an item that is accessed  by the subject.
® Clark and Wilson model
A model designed  for commercial  use with a focus on integrity.  This model assumes  that alteration  prevention
can be more important  than secret disclosure  prevention,  depending  on the characteristics  of the information,
when handling  the security  requirements  of the application.  In this model, only programs  can access  the object
all the time.
@ Chinese  wall model (Brewer-Nash)
A model that blocks the flow of any information  that causes a conflict.  This model prevents  conflicts  of interest
and applies  the concept  of task separation  to access control.
