B) Cloud security
@® Overview  of cloud security
Concerns  about cloud security  begin with the fact that the exact location  of the stored data cannot be easily
understood,  and the data is accumulated,  due to the characteristics  of the cloud. In particular,  when using a
public cloud, the question  of whether  storing sensitive  data on the cloud, which is an external  storage  space, is
correct  in terms of reliability  and stability,  is becoming  an obstacle  to cloud adoption  and spread.
@ Threats  of cloud security
+ Hypervisor  infection
If the hypervisor  in the virtualization  system,  which is essential  to run the cloud service,  is vulnerable,  several
virtual machines  (VMs) using the hypervisor  can be damaged  at the same time.
+ Attack against  the virtual machine
As the users’ virtual machines  are interconnected,  there is an attack path from an internal  virtual machine  to
another  virtual machine,  such as packet sniffing,  hacking,  DDoS attack, and malware  spread.
+ Attacker  tracking
It is difficult for existing  network  security  equipment  (firewall,  IPS, IDS, etc.) to detect attacks and intrusions
against  the inside of the virtualized  machine,  because  it is not easy to identify and trace an attacker  in the
virtual environment.
+ Portability  of the virtual machine
Since virtual machines  can be easily transported  between  physical platforms  in the virtualization,  there is a
possibility  that malware  can spread easily, as the virtual machine  infected  with malware  is ported to another
physical  platform.
® Countermeasures  against  cloud security  threats
+ Protecting  incoming  and outgoing  data
The confidentiality  of incoming  and outgoing  data should be maintained  by using TLS, SSH, VPN, etc. for
security  issues that may occur when sending  user data to the cloud server through  the Internet.
+ Encrypting  data when storing  data
Data should be encrypted  before storing it in the cloud storage,  and at least AES-256  and a secure
cryptographic  algorithm  should be used.
+ Access  and authentication
A secure access and authentication  mechanism  should be applied, the administrator  password  should be
changed  periodically,  and access control policies,  such as 2-factor,  should be established  and observed.
