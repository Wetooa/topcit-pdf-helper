04 The IT Business  Value Chain
A) Overview  of the value chain
The value chain model defines the ultimate  direction  of an enterprise  organization  in terms of the concept  of value.
The model presents  a structure  designed  to help an enterprise  organization  realize its value. The value chain model
has come to be recognized  as a critical management  theory for analyzing  the business  activities  of an enterprise.
Furthermore,  the value chain model not only provides  a very useful framework  for analyzing  and understanding  a
company's  competitive  advantage  from its activities,  but also introduces  the concepts  of key activities  and support
activities  that have become  important  reference  points for enterprises’  organizational  structures.
The concept  of a business  value chain can be approached  from two different  angles: a traditional  manufacturing
company  and an e-commerce  company.  From the angle of a traditional  manufacturing  company,  a business  value
chain explains  how key activities  (warehousing, operation  [production],  shipment,  marketing  and sales, customer
service) and support  activities  (corporate  infrastructure,  HR management,  technology  development,  purchasing
activities)  should be organized  and implemented  if the company  is to reach both its financial and its non-financial
objectives.  The value chain of an e-commerce  company  can be used as a tool for increasing  business  efficiency
and effectiveness  by electronically  handling  business  processes.  In this case, the key activities  are procurement,
zero-inventory  production,  third-party  logistics,  network  sales, and online services.  The support  activities  include
the deployment  of an integrated  information  platform  and network  infrastructure,  Internet  recruitment,  and the
management  of online suppliers.

Before the mid-2000s,  IT-related  activities  or departments  were seen as a category  of back-office  support  activities,
completely  distinct  from the main activities  of a company. However,  since the 2000s, when IT companies  began to
emerge  and existing  companies  accelerated  the integration  of IT, the perception  of the role IT could play and the role
of IT-related  departments  in the value chain model began to change. In particular,  since 2010, the perception  of value
chain models  from the IT business  perspective  has changed  dramatically,  and this change  can be seen from two main
