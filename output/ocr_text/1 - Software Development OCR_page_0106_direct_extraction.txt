© Test case design techniquesSoftware  Development )
Test design techniques  can be classified  into specification-based  techniques,  structure-based  techniques,  and
experience-based  techniques  depending  on the referred  test basis, an origin of the test design.
<Table 30> Test case design  techniques
Item Technique Description
fei A test case is designed  in such a way that a test is performed  with the
Equivalence  partitioning .representative  value placed in an equally  divided area.
Boundary  values  are also included  when designing  a test case because  there
Boundary  value analysis is a high possibility  of a defect  being found in the input value corresponding  to
the boundary  of the equal division.
ao. A table is created  in such a way that the values needed  for the test are
Speciication- Pairwise  testing combined  with other values at least once, and a design is executed using the

Test cases are extracted  from use cases when a system  is modeled  as a useUse case testing
case.
. I ructur i Control  flow testing All possible  event flow (path) structures  can be tested when executed  using a
component  or system.
Structure- : adiTest cases are designed  to achieve  coverage,  which indicates  how far thebased Coverage  testingtechniques system  or software  structure  has been tested by the test suite.
Elementary  comparison Test cases are identified  in such a way that the combination  of input values is
testing tested using the concept  of the modified  condition/decision.
An unofficial  test is designed  that uses the information  obtained  while running
Experience- Exploratory  testing tests, so that testers  can control the test design actively  while running the
based test and so that a new and better test can be designed
techniques The test cases expressed  as a classification  tree are combined  with the
Classification  tree methodrepresentative  values  of the input and output  domains.
O2 Testing  Types and Techniques
A) Testing  types
There are various  types of testing  depending  on various  levels, as shown in <Table 30>. The overriding  principle
is that the testing  subject,  testing  purpose,  and test environment  should be considered  for each type.  .
