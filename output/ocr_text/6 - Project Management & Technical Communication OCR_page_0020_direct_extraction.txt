Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
and bottom-up  communication  includes  reports from bottom to top of the organization.  In general,  formal
communication  with the boss requires  a certain standardized  document  format  and delivery  technique.
Horizontal  communication  refers to communication  between  members  or departments  at a similar level within
an organization.  In the process  of performing  work, it is possible  to achieve common  goals through  organic
interactions  within a functionally  divided organization.  In recent  years, the importance  of horizontal  communi-
cation is increasing,  as new problems  or challenges  of increasingly  complex  and converged  forms are emerging.
Examples  include prior consultation,  circulation,  committees,  and task forces.
B) Communication  channels  and information  integrity
There are many channels  for business  communication,  but usually meetings,  emails, phone calls, reports, and
official letters are used. The amount  and diversity  of information  that can be delivered  are different  for each
communication  channel.  The amount  and degree of diversity  of information  that can be delivered  by commu-
nication  channel  is called information  integrity.

<Figure  4> Communication  Channel  Selection  According  to Information  Integrity
In the figure below, you can see that, in the case of direct conversation,  the level of information  integrity  is
very high in that the amount  of information  to be transmitted  is large, can be delivered  in various languages,
and the speed of delivery  and feedback  are also fast. In contrast,  mediums  such as official letters have very
low level of information  integrity.  E-mail, which is frequently  used for business  communication  in recent years,
has a moderate  level of information  integrity.  E-mail can help overcome  time and space constraints  of a face-
to-face  conversation,  and deliver a message  at a fast speed and attach various  documents,  and unlike phone
calls, the content  of e-mails  sent and received  becomes  a record of your communication.
Table 2 shows the features  and strengths  and weaknesses  of discussions,  meetings,  and e-mails.
