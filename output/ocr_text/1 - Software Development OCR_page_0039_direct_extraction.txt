In 2003, a massive  blackout  occurred  in the northeastern  United States, plunging  seven states in
the US. and one province  in Canada into darkness.  When the incident  was investigated,  it was found
that the power outage had been caused by a software  error in the XA/21 system, which occurs in
the multi-process  method.  That is, the “race condition’  (a type of deadlock)  caused the blackout.
The error occurred  because  two programs  in the XA/21 system simultaneously  wrote and accessed
the same data structure.  The error corrupted  the data structure,  which in turn put the alarm process
into an infinite loop, and even an alarm processing  failure was not notified.  The alarm queue increased
indefinitely,  and all available  memory  was consumed  after 30 minutes.  At that time, the main server
was down. A failover  mechanism  was activated,  and the backup server became  the main server.
However,  the backup server  also failed because  it couldn't  handle the infinitely increasing  queue.
This incident  is a representative  case of software  causing  a fatal error resulting  in tremendous
damage  to real life, because  the software  was developed  without  a proper understanding  of basic
software  technologies  such as the data structure  and algorithm.
A data structure,  which is a way of structurally  expressing  data in programming,  presents  a way to
conveniently  access data and store or organize  them for the purpose  of changing  the data structure.
An algorithm  refers to a well-defined  calculation  process  to output after solving  the problem  by
receiving  a certain  value.
For example,  let’s consider  a case in which a house is built with blocks. We can build the best house
only when we select and stack the most appropriate  block for a given design, such as material,  color,
and shape among several blocks, depending  on the structure  or shape of the house. However,  what is
far more important  than this is that we have to properly  understand  the materials  and characteristics
of each block and the various utilization  methods.  If we don’t use the blocks in the right place, a
shoddy and faulty construction  is inevitable  when the house is completed. The data structure  and
algorithm  are like these blocks. Various  basic technologies  are available  that keep pace with the rapid
development  of information  systems.  Therefore,  we can expect high-quality  software  that is optimal
for a given environment,  if we develop  software  by adopting  and applying  the most appropriate  data
structure  and algorithm.
The data structure is an important  technique  in terms of coding efficiency.  An algorithm  enables  us
to select more easily a data structure  that can solve a given problem,  and also allows us to handle a
given problem  efficiently,  considering  the processing  time and storage  location.
