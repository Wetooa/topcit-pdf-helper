02 Cohesion  and Coupling
It is not easy to clearly define a good design. A good design can be defined  as a design that enables efficient
programming  or a design that helps easy adaptation  to changes  so that software  evolution  programs  can
be solved well. To be recognized  as a good design, design documents  - which are design results - should be
written in a way that is easy to read and understand,  and when changes  are made to the system,  the effect
should be localized.
Maximizing  functional  independence  and reducing  the merging  of modules  are the good design principles that
make maintenance  easier. The object-oriented  design technique  can also maximize  independence  in the end,
improving  the quality of a design. This section describes  cohesion and coupling,  which are factors that affect
quality  in the design phase.
A) Cohesion
Cohesion  is a measure  of module maturity  that indicates  the strength  of the correlations  among the internal
modules.  That is, it indicates  how each of the components  in the module is correlated  with the others in
order to achieve a common  purpose.  Cohesion  indicates  how the components  of a module fit together,  and
is like cement  that binds the components.  Functional  cohesion,  wherein  all elements  of the module perform a
single function for the upper-level  module,  is the highest  degree of cohesion.  Coincidental  cohesion,  wherein  a
module  is composed  of unrelated  processing  elements,  is the lowest degree of cohesion.
Cohesion  also indicates  the degree to which a module performs  a task and thus is another  measure  of
measuring  a module’s  independence  of each other. Therefore,  it is desirable  to design software  in such a
way that cohesion  increases  among the internal elements  of a module,  with each component  of a module  or
system performing  a single logical function  or representing  a single logical entity (model component).  In this
case, interactions  with the outside can generally  be minimized.  When module cohesion is increased,  coupling
between  modules  can be decreased.  Conversely,  low cohesion  can cause high coupling.  When designing
software,  it is desirable  for modules  to have high cohesion  and coupling  between  modules  to be weak. The
types of cohesion  include functional  cohesion,  sequential  cohesion,  communication  cohesion,  procedural
cohesion,  temporal cohesion,  logical cohesion,  and coincidental  cohesion.
