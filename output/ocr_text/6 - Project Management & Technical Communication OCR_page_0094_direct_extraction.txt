Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
the relationship  between  each activity  to develop  a schedule,  with the goal of completing  the project within
the time agreed  with the client.
If the finish date has already  been specified,  the schedule  management  process  is ignored,  and the schedule  is
planned  in a top-down  manner,  the activities  to be performed  will be determined  based on the project  timeline.
The schedule  may get tight as the correlation  between  each activity is neglected  and it is divided by weighting
each stage of the project, which can eventually  fall into a vicious  cycle. Project  schedule  should be feasible  and
planned  in consideration  of scale and resource  capacity.
B) Schedule  management  process
The schedule  management  process  includes  project  schedule  management  planning,  activity  definition,  activi-
ty sequencing,  activity  duration  estimation,  schedule  development,  and schedule  control.  The existing  activity
resource  estimation  process  has been moved to the knowledge  area of resource  management  in the PMBOK
6th edition.
@® Schedule  Management  Planning
For schedule  management  planning,  a project schedule  management  plan is formulated.  A detailed plan is
made by sharing  the project management  plan, project approval,  and rules for measuring  the project  schedule
with the team members.
In addition,  as the project schedule  management  plan is an important  deliverable  for quality control or
supervision,  any change in the confirmed schedule  requires an approval  from the project steering  committee
and the plan must be updated  and kept in a record.
@ Definition  of Activity
It is a process  of identifying  and documenting  the relevant  activities  to be performed  to produce  the project
deliverables.  The project  teams define the activities  based on the project scope and requirements  statement.
Since it is difficult  to define all activities  at the beginning  of the project,  the project  activities  are elaborated  in
a repetitive  and incremental  manner  through  division and Rolling Wave Planning  based on the work breakdown
system  (WBS).
@® Sequencing  of Activity
It is a process of identifying  the relationship  between  subdivided  activities  and connecting  them in a logical
order.
The logical relationship  between  activities  is divided into the following  types:
