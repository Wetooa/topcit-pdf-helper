@® Password  authentication
* Overview  of password  authentication
The user sets the password  in advance.  After that, the user is authenticated  by comparing  the password
entered during authentication,  with the set password.  Although  this authentication  technology  is the most
widely used, it requires  careful attention  when using it because  it is the most insecure  as shown in [Figure 15].

[Figure  15] Vulnerabilities  of the password  authentication  method
+ Password  policy
When creating  a password,  it should have at least 8 digits by combining  uppercase  letters, lowercase  letters,
numbers,  and special characters.  The user should be able to remember  the password  easily, but the attacker
should have difficulty  guessing  it.
Passwords  should not be saved in plaintext,  but should be saved using a hash function,  rather than a two-
way encryption  algorithm.  The authentication  system  should limit the number  of failed login attempts.
+ Attack techniques  against  the password
Attack techniques  against  the password  include brute force attacks,  dictionary  attacks,  Trojan horses, direct
access  to the password  file, social engineering  techniques,  etc.
+ Countermeasures  against  password  attacks
Various countermeasures  can be implemented,  such as using a password  generator,  limiting the number  of
login failures,  changing  passwords  periodically,  using an intrusion  detection  system (IDS) to detect dictionary
attacks  and brute force attacks,  implementing  security  awareness  training,  using an OTP, etc.
@ One Time Password  (OTP) authentication
* Concept  of the OTP
An OTP is one of the methods  used by the authentication  system to authenticate  users. This authentication
technology  uses a one-time  password  generator  that generates  and inputs a one-time  password  for each
session.
+ Type of OTPs
The OTP can be largely  classified  into the synchronous  and asynchronous  types, as shown in <Table 7>.
