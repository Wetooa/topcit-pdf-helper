+ Data destruction  phase
When destroying  big data, the characteristics  of the distribution  and replication  environment  of big
data should be considered,  and it should be completely  destroyed  in an unrecoverable  way. In addition,  a
management  system  for monitoring  the data destruction  is needed in terms of internal  control
© Overview  of personal  information  de-identification
+ Concept  of personal  information  de-identification
De-identification  refers to processing  that makes it difficult  to identify  a specific individual,  even if individually
identifiable  information  in data is combined  with other information,  by deleting  some of or all such information,
or by replacing  some information  with other attributed  information.
+ Targets  of personal  information  de-identification
De-identification  targets information  that can identify  an individual  by him/herself,  and information  that can
be easily combined  with other information  to identify an individual,  even if the information  alone cannot
identify  that individual.
+ Personal  information  de-identification  techniques
Big data de-identification  techniques  include pseudonymization,  aggregation,  data reduction,  data
suppression,  and data masking.

Heuristic  anonymization, A technique  that makes it difficult  to identify  individuals,  by replacing
Pseudonymization  | K-anonymization,  encryption, important  identifying  elements  in personal  information,  with other
exchange  method values.
Aggregation Aggregation,  sub-aggregation, A technique  that shows the total value of data to prevent  the
Rounding,  rearranging  data identification  of individual  data values.
Data reductionSimple anonymization  by deleting
attribute  values, partially  deleting
attribute  values, deleting  data
rows, and removing  identifiersA technique  that removes  unnecessary  values,  or values that are
important  for identifying  individuals, among  the values configured  in
the data set,according  to the purpose  of data sharing  and opening.
Data suppressionData suppression,  random
rounding  method,  range method,
control roundingA technique  that prevents  the identification  of individual  data values,
by converting  data values into category  values.
Data masking
60 TOPCIT  ESSENCEAdding  random  noise, replacing
with spaceA technique  that prevents  the identification  of key personal
identifiers,  which is highly likely to contribute  to the identification  of
an individual  in combination  with open information
