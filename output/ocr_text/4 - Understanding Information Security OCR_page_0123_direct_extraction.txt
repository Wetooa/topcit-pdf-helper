handshake  protocol  should be used, which will be described  below. A session defines cryptographic  security
parameters  that are shared by multiple  connections,  which is used to avoid negotiating  required  new security
parameters  for each connection.
@ Structure  and operation
+ Structure  of the SSL protocol
As shown in [Figure 64], SSL is composed  of four protocols,  including  handshake,  change  cipher Spec, record,
and alert.

<Table 37> shows the functions  by SSL protocol  type.
<Table 37> Function  of the SSL protocol
Type Description
+ Mutual authentication  between  the server  and client
+ Negotiating  the encryption  algorithm,  MAC algorithm,  and cryptographic  key to be
used.
+ Performed  before any application  data transportHandshake  protocol
+ Providing  the confidentiality  and integrity  service  for SSL connections
Record protocol + Encrypting  messages,  using the determined  secret key cipher algorithm
+ Performing  encryption,  using the distributed  symmetric  key
+ Notifying  the other party that the authentication  and encryption  system,  defined  in the
Change  cipher  spec protocol cipher  specification,  will be applied  from now on
+ One-byte  long message  with the value of 1
+ Used to deliver  warnings,  while performing  SSL
Warning  protocol + Awaming  is composed  of 2 bytes, and the first byte conveys  the severity  of the
message:  Warning(1),  Fatal(2)
