C) Risk analysis:  quantitative  risk analysis
Quantitative  risk anallysis is a numeric  estimate  of the overall effect of prioritized  risks on the project objec-
tives (cost and schedule  objectives)  after the qualitative  risk analysis  is completed.
<Table 66> Risk Analysis  Method
Risk Analysis  Method Explanation
incenvewicel + Rely on experience  and precedents  to quantify  the probability  and impact of risk on project
objectives
Probability  Distributions+ Widely  used in modeling  and simulation,  Probability  Distribution  is a measure  of uncertainty
of values such as the duration  of activities,  cost components,  etc.
Tornado  Diagrams+ Apply the same ratio to input data to explain the amount  of change in output, and the
result values are displayed  in a bar graph in order of sensitivity
Scenario  Analysis+ It describes  future situations  based on assumptions  and used for such as system boundary,
allocation  method,  description,  time, space and weighting  method.  It analyzes  the impact
of each assumption  on each calculated  result
Monte Carlo Simulation+ The distribution  of random  variables  is calculated  by repeatedly  substituting  a range of
values for parameters  or variable  of the probability  model, to predict  a specific  variable.
+ Statistical  analysis  that creates  a cumulative  distribution  by generating  random  numbers
according  to the probability  distribution  of input data, and provides  a probabilistic  model by
analyzing  the cumulative  result.
EMV Analysis
D) Risk response
Risk response  is the pro
portunities  for project ol
vance according  to th+ Expected  monetary  value with risks taken into account,  expected  value for possible
occurrence.
+ EMV requires  a risk-neutral  assumption  that neither  avoids nor pursues  risk, multiplies
each result by the probability  of occurrence,  and then sums the values, which is generally
displayed  for decision  tree analysis.
cess of developing  alternatives  and actions  that can reduce threats  and increase op-
bjectives.  When  a risk is about to occur or occurs, a response  plan is executed  in ad-
ie response  strategy.
The risk response  plan applies  the response  method  according  to the positive  and negative  risks.
Negative  risk response  strategy  is a method  to minimize  threats  or risks that may negatively  affect the proj-
ect objectives  and includes  Avoid, Transfer,  Mitigate  and Acceptance.
<Table 67> Negative  Risk Response  Strategy
Strategy Explanation
Avoid+ Amethod  of isolating  or changing  the project's  objectives  from the scope of the risk's impact,
including  changing  the project  management  plan, in order to completely  eliminate  the risk.
+ For example,  it includes  actions  such as schedule  extension,  strategy  alteration  and scope
reduction.
Transfer+ It means  to transfer  the impact  of risk and the subject  of response  to a third party
+ It simply transfers  responsibility  and does not eliminate  the risk.
+ Responsibility  transfer  is the most effective  in dealing  with financial  risk exposure.
+ As a transfer  tool, there are insurance,  performance  bonds, various  warranties  and guarantees.
MitigateA method  of reducing  the likelihood  of a risk and its impact  on the target up to an acceptable
threshold
+ Examples  include  taking initial measures,  performing  many tests, selecting  a simple process,
mitigating  risk, etc.
