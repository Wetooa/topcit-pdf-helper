Overview  of System Architecture )
ran slowly and were difficult  to develop  in this form, since the developer  needed to implement  every interface  for
accessing  the computer's  resources  and allocating  and recovering  resources.  OS implements  input, control,  memory,
operation,  and output functions  to provide services  in order to use computer  resources  efficiently.  In other words,
an OS controls  the computer's  resources  and implements  usage policies to allocate resources  to users through
scheduling,  It exchanges  data through  input/output  devices,  or outputs  exceptions  or errors. The purposes  of using
the operating  system  are as follows.
+ Abstraction:  Provides  standardized  API to application  programs  by abstracting  the complexity  of the computer's
hardware.
+ Virtualization:  Provides  a virtualization  function to enable application  programs  and users to share computer
resources,  and to use a single virtual computer  hardware.
+ Management:  Maximizes  computer  resource  performances  and provides  them to application  programs,  while
meeting  computer  resource  constraints.
B) Main functions  of OS
OS abstracts  and virtualizes  computer  hardware  to provide resources  to application  programs,  or to manage  them
efficiently.  Therefore,  OS can be understood  by the functions  of managing  main hardware  components.  The main
functions  of OS are described  as follows.
@ Process  management
In simple terms, a process is a running  program.  However,  it is actually more than just a program,  as a process  is a
system  work unit that allocates,  uses, and recovers  various  resources,  such as the CPU, storage  unit, files, and input/
output  units to perform  its tasks. An OS manages  processes  and performs  the following  tasks:
- Creating  and disposing  of user and system processes
- Terminating  and re-running  processes
- Providing  a technique  for process  communication  and synchronization
- Providing  techniques  to prevent  deadlock
@ Main memory  unit management
A hard disk (HDD) is the hardware  that most people think of when they consider  a storage unit. However,  the main
memory  is a different  type of storage. The main memory  is a depository  that allows the CPU to fetch commands
and data to use from the instructions,  The addresses  that the CPU uses to access data are only available  in the main
memory.  Even if the CPU intends  to retrieve  data in an HDD, it cannot read the data if it is not stored in the main
memory.  The main memory  must handle the following  management  functions  to provide  data to the CPU:
- Tracking  and managing  the space and the users that use the storage  device
- Deciding  which process  will occupy  the memory  space
- Allocating  and recovering  memory  space
@ File management
OS can store data through  various physical  devices. It is necessary  to abstract  media with different  physical
characteristics,  such as magnetic  tape, magnetic  disks, optical disks, and flash memory,  for the OS to use them. File
management  provides  the function  of abstracting  these physical  characteristics  into files, the logical storage  units. It
handles  the following  tasks:
