* Preview  for practical  business Do you need to make software
development  more efficient?
It has been reported  that the work productivity  of Korea is very low compared  to that of other
advanced  countries  in the global labor market.  The Korean IT industry  is no exception  to the rule. The
IT industry has been making efforts to increase  efficiency  in its own way. Development  productivity
should have been improved  to develop  a system that became  vaster and more complex  in line with
technological  advances.  As a result of these efforts, numerous  platforms  and frameworks,  such as
RAD, agile, CBD, and OOP, and various  CASE tools have been released.
Tools that can be used appropriately  by keeping  pace with the current  era of rapid change  have been
continuously  developed.  The “issue of efficiency”  is the main driver behind countless  tools. Efficiency
became  important  in terms of securing  higher productivity,  improving  quality, and completing  a given
project within  a set period. As the tools described  above were released,  higher productivity  and
quality in software  development  could be secured  to some degree.
