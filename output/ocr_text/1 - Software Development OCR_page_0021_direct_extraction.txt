proceeds  with analysis,  design, and implementation  sequentially.  However,  formal techniques  were less usable
for general software  developers,  and the Waterfall  model was expensive  and slow to implement.  Recognizing
these problems,  methods  of boosting  the productivity  of software  development  were studied to efficiently
develop software by increasing  its reusability  in the 1980s. In the 1990s, software vendors  had to reduce
the ‘time to market’  to gain  a competitive  advantage. As a result, much research  aimed at raising software
development  productivity  was conducted,  and models  focusing  on concurrent  engineering  - which could carry
out requirement  definition,  design, implementation  in the Waterfall  model simultaneously  - were adopted. As
the market environment  surrounding  software  began to change rapidly in the 2000s, the agile methodology
was comprehensively  adopted  to effectively  respond  to such rapid changes.
C) Four key elements  of software  engineering
Software  engineering  is defined  as “a discipline  that studies the overall life cycle of software  - such as
development,  operation,  and maintenance  - systematically,  descriptively  and quantitatively.”  The following
section  describes  the four key elements  of software  engineering,  which make it possible  to produce  top quality
software  and deliver  it according  to a given cost and schedule.
@ Method
+ The method is composed  of project planning  and estimation,  system and software  analysis,  data structure,
program  structure,  algorithm,  coding,  testing,  and maintenance  tasks.
+ Methods  centered  on a specific language  (e.g. an object-oriented  method),  or graphical  notation,  are
introduced  from time to time.
+ Aseries  of evaluation  standards  for software  quality  is introduced.
@ Tool
+ “Tool” refers to an automated  or semi-automated  method  that is used to improve  productivity  or consistency
when performing  a task.
+ There are numerous  tools in the software  development  lifecycle  (e.g. requirements  management  tools,
modeling  tools, configuration  management  tools, change  management  tools).
+ When tools are integrated  in such a way that the information  created  by one tool can be used by other tools,
it is set as a system  that supports  software  development.
@® Procedure
+ A procedure  combines  a method  and a tool so that they can be used to develop  software  in a rational  and timely  fashion.
+ The procedure  defines the applied method,  required deliverables  (documents,  reports, etc.), controls  to
guarantee  quality and assist coordinate  adjustment,  and the sequence  of milestones  that enable software
managers  to evaluate  progress.
@ People
+ As many tasks (establishment,  improvement,  maintenance,  etc.) are performed  by employees  and organizations
specializing  in software  engineering,  software  engineering  relatively  depends  more heavily  on people.
+ It is practically  impossible  to summarize  software  development  in an easily accessible  or graspable  manner
