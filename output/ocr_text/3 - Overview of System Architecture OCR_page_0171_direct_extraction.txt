The elements  of the IPv4 address  include an IP address,  which is a unique identification  address  given to all
communication  networks  that are connected  to the Internet  and computers  connected  to the network, a network
ID, which identifies  TCP/IP hosts in the same physical  network,  a host ID, which identifies  the TCP/IP host on the
network,  and the 32-bit subnet mask, which specifies  the network  name for the iP address  from the hostname.
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain  Routing,  RFC 1519) is a method  of expressing  the IPv4 address  and one of IP allocating
methods  that does not divide the network  part from the host part in 8-bit units. Moreover,  subnetting  and
supernetting  can flexibly  express  the network  and host Ips, according  to the number  of IPs required by the network,
without  dividing  the IPv4 address  and the network  ID into fixed 8-bit units. Here, subnetting  refers to dividing  a given
IP address  into small subnets,  according  to the network  environment,  and supernetting  refers to combining  multiple
network  IDs into one network  ID.
Here, subnetting  refers to dividing  a given IP address into small subnets  to suit the network  environment,  and
supernetting  refers to combining  multiple  network  IDs into one network  ID.
