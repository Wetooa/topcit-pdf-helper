@ Ethical Issues Related  to Drones
As the drone-related industry  has recently  emerged  as a representative  field of the 4th industrial  revolution,  the
investment  and research  on drones are actively being conducted.  Drones  are becoming  an issue in the education
filed, with the rise of education  using drones  and training  for professional  drone pilots.
Recently,  drones are not limited to a hobby or mere filming, but are also used for industrial  purposes  such as delivery,
forest fire monitoring,  and distribution  of pesticides.  As drones can be used for real-time  command  systems,
surveillance  systems,  high-definition  video recording  and sharing, and autonomous  driving, its use is expected  to
spread to all industries.
Along with the increased  use of drones, various accidents  such as drone crashes,  collisions  with buildings,  and flying in
no-fly zones are also increasing.

As drones are becoming  more popular,  the number  of drone accidents  continues  to increase.
Drone hacking  and privacy  invasion  accidents  as well as crashes,  are frequently  occurring.
There have also been incidents  of hacking  drones  to disrupt  remote  control or steal the imagery  captured  in drones.
For example,  data of US. combat  drones was leaked to hackers  and traded on the black market, and there were
cases in which a video footage  of a country's  key intelligence  data stored in the drone was leaked due to the hacking.
The number  of personal information  infringement  cases is increasing  as videos related to personal  life are illegally
filmed and collected/transmitted  by drones.
Therefore,  it is necessary  to understand  drone-related  regulations  and ethical guidelines  before operating  drones to
