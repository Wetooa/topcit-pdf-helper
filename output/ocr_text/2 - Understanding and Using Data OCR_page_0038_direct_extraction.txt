Database )
Simple  and easy toimplement Easy to implement  using syntax  similar  to SQL, such as for, let, where, and return (FLWR).
|) Concept  and characteristics  of XLL
XLL is a standard  language  that performs  link functions  in an XML document,  such as linking XML documents  and
setting  specific locations  within an XML document.  XLL was introduced  to overcome  the limitations  of HTML-based
simple hyperlinks  and to provide  various approaches  to using resources  on the web. XLL supports  various hyperlink
methods  and two-way  links between  link resources.  XLL can use  some of the required  web resources  by using
XPointer  or XPath, and is used as a core technology  in X-Intemet,  etc.
+ Supports  two types, i.e. Xpointer  when moving  within the same document,  and XInik when moving between
different  pages, etc.
+ Provides  a two-way  link between  resources.
+ Provides  an extended  pointer  (XPointer)  for resource  locating.
+ Link type: Simple, Extended,  Locator,  Group, Document.
04 Understanding  Various  Database  Types
A) Multimedia  database
The multimedia  database  was developed  to efficiently  search and manage unstructured  multimedia  data
characterized  by their large capacity  and complexity,  such as text, image, audio, video, etc. Existing  databases  face
limitations  due to the exponential  increase  of unstructured/multimedia  data, and an object-oriented  approach,  the
synchronized  representation  of multimedia,  and the concept  of time-dependent  modeling  were used to model various
types of unstructured  data.

Used for simple search-oriented  VOD (Video On Demand).
It is difficult  to support  the function  for restoring  concurrent  data access rights (DBMS  functions  are not used.)
Stores  ASCII text data in the CLOB (Character  Large Object)  field
Stores the image/video/audio  in the BLOB (Binary  Large Object)  field.
It is difficult  to build a complete  multimedia  database.

based It is incompatible  with existing  databases
ORDBMS Supports  the CLOB and BLOB field to store mono media.
based Defines the types for each media using user-defined  types and functions.
B) Main memory  database  (MMDB)
Unlike general commercial  databases  in which a database  is stored on a disk, the main memory  database  manages
and manipulates  a database  by keeping it in the memory.  The current  trend is that the main memory  database
is actively used due to business  demands,  such as securing  the competitiveness  of an enterprise  through quick
decision-making,  and the revolutionary  development  of related technologies  such as the release of 64-bit OS, the
