01 User Interface  Overview
The word “Interface”  refers to a device that faces each other between  two objects as the composition  of the
word (“inter’+’face’)  implies. The user interface  refers to a device or software  that ensures  a smooth  exchange
of information  between  user and system. It acts like a window for software.  For example,  if a user inputs/
outputs  commands  or selects a menu using a keyboard  or mouse to use a specific software,  it belongs  to the
user interface. The interface  should be designed  with a focus on the following  points.
A) Consistency
The user interface  should be created consistently.  However,  it is generally  difficult  to maintain  consistency
when developing  a large system,  since several people design and implement  user interfaces.  User interface
standards  should be established  before development  to make user interfaces  consistent,  and user interfaces
should also be checked  after their development  to correct  any errors.
B) User-centered  design
The user interface  should be designed  with a focus on the user because  it is for the user, who should be able
to control it effectively.  Therefore, it is essential  to design the user interface  in such a way that users can learn
“input and output  language’  easily.
C) Feedback
The user interface  should provide meaningful  feedback.  When a user presses  a wrong button or tries to
perform an operation  incorrectly,  the user interface  should enable the user to easily understand  his or her
mistakes.
D) Confirming  destructive  behavior
When a user tries to delete data or files, the user interface  should confirm  it before executing  it. If possible,  the
user interface  should be designed  in such a way that the user cannot  cause critical errors. The Undo function is
also a useful method in this regard.
O2 User Experience  Overview
User experience  comprises  the ideas and actions of the designer  who tries to improve  the user’s environment.
It refers to comprehensive  experience  such as experience,  emotion,  perception,  attitude,  and response  when
a user wants to achieve a purpose by using a system or service. It is a process  of researching  a convenient
screen design and environment  for the users.
A) Differences  between  user experience  (UX) and user interface  (Ul)
User experience  (UX) refers to the study of invisible  things, whereas  user interface  (UI) refers to the concrete
