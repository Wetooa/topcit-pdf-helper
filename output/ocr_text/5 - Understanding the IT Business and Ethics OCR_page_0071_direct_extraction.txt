@ Understanding  ILM
Information  life cycle management  (ILM) is a series of processes  for separating  and managing  storage media, which is
necessitated  by ongoing  changes  in the value of data or information  throughout  its life cycle.
As the volume of data increases,  so does the cost of managing  data. In contrast,  the value of data changes  as it
goes through  its life cycle. Thus, enterprises  are tuning  to ILM in order to reduce their data management  costs and
manage  data in a more systematic  way.

The constituent  elements  of ILM belong to one of two categories,  ie. the management  policy category  or the
technology  element  category.

@ Understanding  IRM
The purpose  of information  resource  management  (IRM) is the efficient  and integrated  management  of IT resources.
Here, efficient  and integrated  management  means preventing  redundant  investments  in IT resources  and increasing
returns  on investments.  It also means managing  all types of IT resources  from HT resources  to IT equipment,  budgets
and outputs.
