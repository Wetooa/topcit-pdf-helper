Business  rule engine (BRE) is a technique  for effectively  managing,  automating,  and optimizing  processes  by
formalizing  the complex  business  rules and process  flows of an enterprise.  The ever increasing  volume  of information
processed  by IT business  processes  and the increasing  complexity  of process  flows have led to the need for rule-
based management.  Rule-based  management  is also needed for service improvements  and cost savings. For this
reason, the adoption  of BRE can help enterprises  to proactively  manage  changes  in, and reduce the operating  costs
of, business  processes.

B) IT business  process  information  management
As IT business  processes  become ever more complex  and have to respond rapidly to environmental  (both external
and internal)  changes, there is a growing  need for the systematized  management  of the data generated  by
such processes.  The data generated  by IT business  processes  can be managed  either by information  life cycle
management  (ILM) or by information  resource  management  (IRM).
