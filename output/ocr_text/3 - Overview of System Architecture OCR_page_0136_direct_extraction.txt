@ OS-level  virtualization
It is a virtualization  technology  that makes the system look like it’s using another  OS on the OS. It uses the
virtualization  technology  included in the OS, instead of a hypervisor.  The container  technology  that allocates  and
isolates  the resources  included  in the OS has gained interest.  The leading  OS-level  virtualization  technologies  include
Solaris Containers,  FreeBSD  Jails, and Linux Docker. The guest OS must be the same as the host OS, since it uses
the OS's container  function, instead of a hypervisor.  Containers  on the OS are allocated  resources,  such as memory,
storage,  and network,  which are independently  operated  between  containers.

[Figure  99] OS-Level  Virtualization
Container  virtualization  technology  can be characterized  as being lighter and more portable  than existing
virtualization  technologies.  In Linux containers  (LXC), there is kernel space for managing  physical resources,  and a
user space for executing  user processes  inside the OS. The container  virtualization  technology  partitions  the user
space into ten and limits the resources  visible in each user process.

OS-level  virtualization  (container  virtualization)  has the following  advantages:
* Quick start and finish: Very fast compared  to hypervisor-based  virtualization
+ High density:  Minimized  resource  consumption,  since an OS can operate  multiple  containers
+ Low overhead:  Userspace  isolated  without  emulation
