In the past, the perception  of IT among the business  community  was that IT could play an auxiliary  role
in business  processes,  but that nothing more could be expected  from it. However,  as digital technologies
have become  ever more deeply  embedded  in users’ lifestyles,  IT is being actively  integrated  into corporate
business  processes.  It is from this perspective  that people must understand  not only the concept  of (IT?)
business  but also the IT ecosystem  and IT value chain related  to IT business.
