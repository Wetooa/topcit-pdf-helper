participate  in the manufacturing  of products  or the service delivery  process,  enterprises  are creating  better  products
and services.  The profits generated  in this way are shared with the participants,  while the enterprises  themselves
are able to obtain creative ideas from potential  future consumers  at very little or no cost at all. Therefore,  through
crowdsourcing,  enterprises  are able to acquire insights about consumers  in a rapidly changing  market: and, through
the success  of early adopters,  they can also ascertain  the need for their products  or services.  For this reason, the
utilization  of crowdsourcing  by companies  is expected  to increase  in the future.
@ Open innovation
Open innovation  is a method  of enterprise  innovation.  During the research  and development  and productization
processes,  an enterprise  can open up the whole process  and invite outside  experts  to share their ideas and
knowledge.  Through  this form of sharing, enterprises  hope to reduce costs and increase  the likelihood  of success.  In
the past, enterprises  approached  R&D activities  more as an opportunity  to augment  and boost the efficiencies  of
their R&D manpower  and their technological  prowess, rather than as a chance to cooperate  with outside  parties. In
fact, enterprises  kept the lid on the output  of their development  activities  firmly sealed.
This kind of corporate  activity had its limitations  when it came to responding  to the rapidly changing  market
environment,  and it became  more difficult  to launch products  on time and satisfy the changing  needs of consumers.
In traditional  R&D, the size of investments  grew year by year, but the chance of succeeding  was small and the risks
borne by enterprises  wereon an upward trend. In order to address  these problems,  enterprises  began to actively
explore the option of developing  new products  or services  in collaboration  with outside experts, institutions  and
organizations  that held the required  core capabilities.
Today, the sources  of technology  development  (venture  companies,  SMEs, research  institutes,  and universities)  have
become  even more diverse  and the scope of potential  technologies  has expanded,  and the development  of network
infrastructures  has led to an era in which business  connections  with the outside  world can create ever greater  value.
Thus, enterprise  improvements  triggered  from the outside  are accelerating  more than ever before.
