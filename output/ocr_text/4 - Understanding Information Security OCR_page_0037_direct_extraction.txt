<Table  7> Type of OTPs
Item Contents
An authentication  server  generates  a random  number  and sends it
Synchronous Challenge-response to the client, and the client generates  a one-time  password  using
the random  number  as an input value.
The authentication  server  and the client are synchronized,  and a
Time-synchronous one-time password is created by using the time as an input value.
Asynchronous The authentication  count record is shared with the authentication
Event-synchronous server, and a one-time  password  is created by using the
authentication  count as an input value.
[Figure 16] shows the OTP operating  procedure  of the time-synchronous  type.

® Biometric  authentication
+ Concept  of biometric  authentication
Authentication  technology  to extract the measurable  physical  or behavioral  features  of a person, using an
automated  sensor, and to use it as a means  of authentication.
+ Characteristics  of biometric  authentication
Universality:  Each person  must have the characteristic  used by the system.
Distinctiveness:  The characteristic  must be distinguishable.
Acquisition:  The characteristic  can be measured  and quantified  from the sensor.
Permanence:  The characteristic  must not change  or modify  during  the human life.
Accuracy:  The characteristic  that requires  authentication  precision,  regardless  of environmental  changes.
Acceptability:  The acquisition  phase should not be intrusive  and the system should be user-friendly.
+ Types of biometric  authentication
As shown in <Table 8>, the types of biometric  authentication  can be divided into a method using body
information  and a method  using behavioral  characteristics.
