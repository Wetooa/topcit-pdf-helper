© Step 3: Combining  XML and DTD
+ Determines  whether  the DTD declaration  and definition  part will be created  inside XML or saved as an external  file.
+ Internal  declaration:  Defines  the DTD in an XML document.
+ External  declaration:  Applies  the DTD (Document  type declaration)  part to an XML document.
G) Concept  and characteristics  of XML Schema,  and comparison  with DTD
The existing  DTD cannot limit or extend the data type or range of certain information,  and the DTD description
grammar  differs from the XML description  grammar,  which requires understanding  of both the DTD and XML
grammars,  As a result, the XML schema  was introduced  to replace  the DTD and to enable the creation  of a data type
that can process  a document  more easily.
Supporting  data types: More complex  types of data than the existing  DTD can be created, and new types can be
created  and used.
+ Supporting  complex  structure  definition:  Another  schema  document  can be included  in a schema  document  using
the Schema  location  directive.
+ Supporting  a namespace:  XML Schema  supports  a namespace.
* Namespace:  An abstract  entity that can distinguish  elements  when extracting  elements  from an XML document
type and combining  them with other documents,  and when processing  multiple  documents  at the same time.
<Table 15> Comparison  of the XML Schema  and DTD
Item XML Schema DTD
Writing  grammar  | Complies  with XML 1.0. EBNF + pseudo
Structure Complex Relatively  simple
Namespace Supported  (Multiple  namespaces  can be used ina document.)  | Not supported  (Used once in a document.)
DOM support DOM is supported  and can be used because  it is XML. Not supported.
Dynamic Supported  (Selecting  at runtime.  Subject  to change due to an | Not supported
schema  support  | interaction.) (DTD can actually  read only.)
Data type Extensive  data type Very limited data type
Scalability Fully object-oriented  scalability Extension  using string substitution
Openness Content  model that supports  open and closed modification. Closed structure
H) Characteristics  of XQuery
XQuery  is a query language  that is used to search an XML-based  database, and can extract  information  from XML
files as if using a database.
<Table 16> Characteristics  of XQuery
Characteristics Description
Technology  neutral | A technology  that is standardized  based on W3C-based  XQuery1.0.
- DA data search and storage  technology  using XML.
- A language  that is originated  from an XML query language  called Quilt and which includes  the XPath
expression
- The result of the query statement  written  in XQuery  is the list of nodes indicating  a tree structure,  not
an XML document.XML-based  query
language
