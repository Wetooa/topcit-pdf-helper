transport  layer. The concept  of this layer includes,  not only the application  layer, but also the presentation
layer and the session  layer of the OSI reference  model.
+ Transport  layer: Also known as the host-to-host  transport  layer. This layer manages  data exchange  between
virtual ports that are managed  by the application  program,  such as the TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocol.  This:
layer corresponds  to the transport  layer of the OSI reference  model.
+ Internet  layer: Also known as the network  layer, this layer manages  the addressing  and routing  functions,  and
it corresponds  to the network  layer of the OSI reference  model.
The network  interface  layer in [Figure 58] is not a concept  that is dependent  on the structure  of the TCP/
IP protocol.  It is also referred to as a network  access layer. The network  interface  layer is randomly  selected
by the network  interface  layer and practically  transfers  TCP/IP packets  through a physical medium,  such as
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet  or IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi. This layer includes  the functions  of both the data link layer, which
manages  the MAC function  of the OSI 7-layer reference  model, and the physical layer that defines electrical
signals.

@ Security  function  by layer
Since the purpose  of designing  the TCP/IP protocol structure  lies in free information  exchange,  the concept
of security  is not considered  in the design process.  As TCP/IP is used as the core protocol  of the Internet,
and the application,  like e-Commerce,  is developed  or used, protocols  with security  functions  are added to
