After that, the contents  naturally  described  according  to the table of contents  are summarized  focused  on
keywords.  A one-page  report is completed  by subtracting  elaborate  words and putting  only the keywords  in a
concise  and clear manner.
As in the example in the table below, the work of the organization  cannot be exaggerated  with flowery
language,  so it should be described  based on the fact itself, As shown in the example  below, just [Beautiful
Night] is enough  to convey  the meaning  of [It’s a very wonderful  and beautiful  night.]. Also, as in the example
below, if the phrase [spent a lot of money] can be substituted  with [excessive  spending],  to deliver the
meaning  more clearly.

While most of the poorly written reports have a description  of current status and analysis,  they are often
not clear what they want to assert or what conclusions  they want to draw.  It is very important  to clarify the

question  of “How are you going to do it?” asked by a manager  or a stakeholder.
@ Effective  Use of Tables
Since summarization  is important  for a one-page  report, narration  alone is not enough. Therefore,  proper use
of narrative  sentences  and tables help to summarize  and describe  a large amount  of content  on one page.
© Methods  of Writing  the Title of the Report
The title should be written in a way that the content  of the document  can be immediately  identified.  Especially
for busy managers  and executives,  it is very important  to write the title well so that the content  can be
immediately  grasped  just by looking  at the title. It is better to condense  the content  within 20 characters  so
that anyone  can identify  the whole content,  purpose,  and nature of the report even by reading  the title.
If you look at the examples  below, well-written  titles imply the year, the nature of the document,  etc., while
poorly written titles are not specific and ambiguous.  It is necessary  to describe  the title of the document  in a
