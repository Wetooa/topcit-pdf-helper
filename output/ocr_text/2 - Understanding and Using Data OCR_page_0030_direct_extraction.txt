+ Preview  for practical  business Reasons  to understand  database  types
The relational  database  and the object relational  database,  which are based on EF. Codd’s normalization
theory  of 1970, have mainly been used in the existing  workplace,  because  data consistency  was important
in workplaces  where OLTP (Online Transaction  Processing)  jobs were dominant.  However,  the processing
of diverse types of data and the rapid processing  of large quantities  of data are required  these days.
Therefore,  DBMS vendors  are developing  DBMS functions  in such a way that the advantages  of each type
of database  can be introduced  and applied.
As a result, if we know the background  to database  development  and the basic concepts  of the major
types of database,  we can easily understand  the functions  and purposes  of the various DBMSs used for
various purposes  in the workplace  and get help in strategically  selecting  a DBMS that is optimized  for the
characteristics  and purposes  of the business  in question.
