<Ethical  guidelines  to be considered  for drone use>
+ accident  prevention:  Prevents  the risk of human  and object  collision  and minimizes  damage  in case of collision
+ Hacking  prevention  and security  enhancement:  Drones  without  security  functions  are vulnerable  to hacking  and
interference.  Information  should not be leaked by hacking.
+ Prohibition  of malicious  use: Drones should not be used as weapons  or used for terrorism,  as well as a tool of “spy
camera”
+ Prevention  of invasion  of privacy and leakage  of personal  information:  It is prohibited  to arbitrarily  collect/transmit
information  related to the public and private life of others by drones. Filming to identify  the personal  data subject
without his or her consent,  and the collection  of personal  location data should be prohibited.  The freedom  and
rights of others from being violated  by drones  should be prevented.
+ Prevention  of theft: Prevention  of data leakage  due to theft of drones
+ Understanding  and compliance  of policy: Drone compliance  by country. Understand  drone policies by country  and
region and operate  drones accordingly
+ Operation  and safety education:  Safety education  on drone control can reduce the risk of safety accidents  and help
clearly  understand  response  measures  and accountability  in the event of an accident.
The key drone policies in major countries  at home and abroad are as follows.
