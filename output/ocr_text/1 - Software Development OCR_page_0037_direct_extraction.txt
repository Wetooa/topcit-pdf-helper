in the initial lifecycle  phase is created,  using the program  or document  obtained  in the last phase of the software  lifecycle.
Reverse  engineering  is the opposite  concept  of forward  engineering  in which development  is performed  sequentially  from the
design. The concept  of reverse  engineering  can be understood  by looking  at the flow of input and output  below.
<Table  6> Input/output  of reverse  engineering
Input Output
Data or document  in the form of I/O, such as the source code, | Structure  diagram,  data flow chart, control flow graph, entity
object  code, work procedure,  library, etc. relationship  diagram,  etc.
B) The main reasons  why reverse  engineering  is necessary
+ When it is difficult  to maintain  a running  system.
+ When frequent  changes  decrease  a system’s  efficiency
+ When redeveloping  a business  system based on a file system into one based on a relational  database.
+ When downsizing  the default  mainframe
C) Advantages  of reverse  engineering
+ Commercialized  or previously  developed  software  can be analyzed.
+ Maintainability  can be improved  since the data and information  of the existing  system  can be analyzed  at the
design level.
+ CASE can be used easily by storing  existing  system information  in a repository.
D) Types of reverse  engineering
+ Reverse engineering  can be divided into logical reverse engineering  and data reverse engineering  for
description.
<Table  7> Types of reverse  engineering
Type Description
Logic reverse Information  is extracted  from the source code and stored in the physical  design information  storage.
engineering Physical  design information  is obtained
Data reverse
engineeringThe existing  database  is modified  or migrated  to a new database  management  system.
