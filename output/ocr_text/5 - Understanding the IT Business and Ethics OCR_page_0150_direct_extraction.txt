+ Server  virtualization
By consolidating  dozens of physical server workloads  within the data center on to several virtual servers,  the
utilization  of server resources  can be improved  (physical  rack costs, administrative  costs, and green IT).
+ Storage  virtualization
In place of the physical storage space required,  a technology  called Thin-Provisioning  virtually  allocates  only
the initial minimum  required  space to enable service implementation.  It also provides  an environment  where
heterogeneous  storage  systems  can be integrated  and used.
+ Network  virtualization
L2, L3, L7 switches,  network  firewalls,  and security  equipment  that had existed in the form of hardware  appliances
are implemented  as virtual machines.  This allows network  resources  to operate internally  through  virtualization,
even ina single shared physical  environment.
+ Functions  of virtualization
Virtualization  includes  four basic functions:  sharing,  aggregation,  emulation,  and insulation.
<Table78>  Virtualization  functions
Function Description Examples
+ A function  in which many virtual resources  are
used in one identical  physical  resource.
Sharing + It is used to allocate  a portion of physical resources
to each virtualized  resource.  Or use a physical
resource  by sharing  through  time sharing  method.+ Logical partitioning  (LPARs),
+ Virtual machine  (VM),
+ Virtual disk
+ Virtual LAN(VLANs)
+ The virtualization  concept  that is the opposite
of sharing,  Virtual resources  exist across multiple
physical  resources.  Outward  appearance  wise,
it can increase  the overall capacity.  From a
holistic perspective,  it can simplify  utilization  and
management.Aggregation + Storage  virtualization
+ A function  that can make some function  or
characteristics  in a virtual resource  appear  to have + iSCSI
existed  from the very beginning  although  they do + virtual tape storage
not exist in physical  resources.Emulation
+ Intermapping  between  virtualized  and physical
resources  is a feature  that allows physical
resources  to be replaced  without  affecting
virtualized  resources  or users who use them. This
function  is also called transparent  change  and has
the effect of preventing  failure (Failure  Proof).Insulation + RAID storage  controller  which uses multi disks
© Blockchain  service
The surge in the use of cryptocurrency  Bitcoin in recent years has led to growing  interest  in blockchain,  the core
technology  behind Bitcoin. Using the concept  of distributive  network-based  decentralization,  Blockchain  is a
distributed  ledger  network  technology  in which P2P data blocks that are stored on a distributive  network  form chains
with each other.
