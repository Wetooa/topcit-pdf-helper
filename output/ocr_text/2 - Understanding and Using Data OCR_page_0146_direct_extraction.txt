01 Big Data Overview
A) Definition  and characteristics  of big data
@ Definition  of big data
Big data generally  refers to either data that exceed  the ability of database  management  tools used to capture,  store,
and analyze  data (McKinsey,  2011), or to next-generation  technologies  and architectures  designed  to extract  value
from large-scale  data at low cost and support  the rapid collection,  discovery,  and analysis  of data (IDC, 2011).
@ Characteristics  of big data (3V)
The characteristics  of big data can be explained  by the three elements  (3V) of big data, namely,  volume,  velocity,  and
variety. Each element  has the following  characteristics.
<Table  66> Characteristics  of the three elements  of big data (3 Vs)
Three elements Description
- Refers to a volume  of data of tens of terabytes,  petabytes  or more, thus exceeding  theVolume : : : :processing  limit of commonly  used software  when collecting,  storing,  and processing  data.
Velocit: - ‘Big data’ is created  very quickly.
y - Data collection,  processing,  storage, and analysis  need to be processed  in real time.
Variet - Diverse kinds of data
y - Big data can be classified  into structured,  semi-structured,  and unstructured  data.
> 6V of big data = Volume,  Variety, Velocity,  Veracity,  Visualization,  Value.
© Structured  data vs. unstructured  data
<Table  67> Description  of structured,  semi-structured,  and unstructured  data
Data type Description
Structured - Data to be stored in a fixed field.
- Data not stored in a fixed field, but which contain  metadata  or schema,  such as XML or HTML.
- XML, CVS, XLS, RDF, etc.
- Data not to be stored in a fixed  field.
- Document,  picture,  video, and audio data, etc.Semi-structured
Unstructured
B) Detailed  technology  by big data life cycle

Item Description Detailed  technology
. - A technology  that can collect  data from all devices - Crawling  (web robot), ETL, CEP (Complexoer and systems. Event Processing),  etc
Storage/ - A technology  that can store and process  collected - Distributed  file system, NoSQL, MapReduce,
processing large-scale  data using a distributed  processing  system. processing
Analysis -A method  of analysis that can assist companies  and - Natural language  processing,  machine
the public with using big data in business  and daily life. learning,  data mining  algorithms,  etc.
Visualization - patil  that can visualize analyzed results - Visualization  such as R, graphs, drawings, etc.
