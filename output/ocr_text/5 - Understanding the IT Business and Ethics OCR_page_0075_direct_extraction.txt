[Fig. 26] Relationship  between  PI and ERP
With Pl, IT business  innovation  can be approached  in two different ways: one method consists  in adopting  ERP
through Pl, while the other consists  in using ERP to accelerate the implementation  of PI. Irrespective  of which
approach  is taken, an enterprise  must strategically  establish  an adoption  plan and a direction  that reflect the
circumstances  of the enterprise.
@® Pl and change  management
Once the process  of an enterprise  has been innovatively  improved,  the enterprise  must grant itself sufficient  time to
adapt to the changed  process.  In such a situation,  the organization's  productivity  drops rapidly,  and in order to ensure
the success  of Pl projects  and mitigate  the decline in productivity,  issues like expectations,  resistance,  insecurity,  and
motivation  must be effectively  managed  at each stage of the project.
