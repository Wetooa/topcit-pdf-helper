>> Recent  trends and issues
In network  technology  have evolved  from data communication,  through existing  56kbps wired media, to
wireless networks  and mobile  communication  of hundreds  of Mbps and even Gbps. Moreover,  the advent
of various  connected  terminals  has led people to in an inseparable  relationship  with communication  in their
daily lives, as well as in more diverse  business  areas. Accordingly,  software  used in a terminal  or system has
a close relationship  with a network,  and it is based on mutual communication.  It is necessary  to understand
and utilize the standard  protocols  used by networks  to design and develop  organic  and optimized  software,
based on this network  concept.
