+ Decentralized
A system  that by itself proves and guarantees  the integrity  of data by having all the nodes on the network  working
together  without  the presence  of a central server (a central aggregator).
+ Improved  security
Security  is greatly improved  because  a transaction  is accepted  only after the consent  of more than half of all nodes
on the network  is obtained.
+ Transparency  of transactions
The details  of transaction  record are disclosed  because  all nodes participating  in a network  share their ledgers.
+ Enhanced  safety
Because  of the distributive  nature of the network,  even if an error or abnormality  appears  on some participating
nodes, the network  can easily recover  itself
+ Improved  economics
Because  there is no central server, centralized  management  costs and financial  transaction  costs can be reduced.
+ Protection  of personal  data
The burden of collecting,  security  and leaking  of development  related data caused by system error or hacking  of the
central system  is reduced.
