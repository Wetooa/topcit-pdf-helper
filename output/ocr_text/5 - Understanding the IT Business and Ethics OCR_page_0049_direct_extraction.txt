Application
Architecture- Stage of extracting  information  needed  on the job, and of
identifying  and defining  the activities  for processing  and managing
such information. Service  Component  Reference
- Create standards  that define the functions  needed  for developing Model (SRM)
an application,  and the characteristics  and the environment  of the
application  task.
- Finds which documents  are needed  for the activities  defined  in
the business model. Data Reference  Model
Dota ane este - Design data model by understanding  the interrelationships (ORM)
between  all information,  data, and data structures.
- Defines  the criteria  for selecting  the infrastructure  that supports
Technology the business  and data application  and other technologies.- Technology  Reference  Model
Architecture - Technology  architecture  also defines the technical support (TRM)
services  for the above.
- Defines  the detailed  technology  list for the technology
Standard  Profile architecture  (TA).
- Example)  JAVA architecture  version: JDK 2.0
There is a reference  model for each individual  architecture,  namely  the performance  reference  model (PRM), service
component  reference  model, data reference  model, and technology  reference  model, respectively.  The reference
model provides  early reference  cases in an identical  business sector  or similar industries  that a company  could use
as a guide when it seeks to deploy an EA. There is also a government  EA reference  model for government-wide  EA,
which is used as a reference  when EAs are deployed  at the departmental  level.
As a side note, the government-wide  EA includes  security  architecture  in addition  to the four abovementioned
architectures.
C) The EA framework
The Zachman  Framework,  TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture),  and FEAF (Federal  Enterprise Architecture
Framework)  are some of the leading EA frameworks  in use today. The Zachmann  Framework  is the one used
most often when estab!

companies.  FEAF is also a framework  developed  in 1998 by the U.S. CIO Council with the
Framework  and Spewak.
<Table8>Types  of EA framework
EA framework Description
+ This is the framework  used most often when establishing  an EA. It is defined  as a matrix using
Zachmann view and perspective.
Framework + 5perspectives:  Planner, Owner, Designer,  Builder,  Subcontractor.
+ 6 ways of describing  each perspective:  Data, Function,  Network,  People,  Time, Motivation.
+ This framework  consists  of an architecture  development  method  (ADM) cycle, a technology
TOGAE reference  model(TRM),  and an SIP (standards  information  point), which is a DB containing
summarized  standards  information.  It is structured  to resolve  problems  at the component  unit
level by employing  an approach  that uses the concept  of building  blocks.
