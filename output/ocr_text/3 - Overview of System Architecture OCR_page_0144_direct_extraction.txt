02 Big Data Dystem  Trends  and Forecast
A) Big data system  trends
@ Formation  of system  ecosystem,  based on the strengths  of each enterprise
Big data system service providers  form a corporate  ecosystem  by promoting  strategies  to solve problems, such as
real-time  processing,  memory-based  processing,  ease of query, and accessibility  to various  file systems  that big data
must overcome,
* Companies  like Amazon,  that have already secured  cloud capabilities,  are trying to build unique platforms  by linking
their cloud and open source-based  big data solutions.
+ IBM, Microsoft,  and others, that were leaders in corporate  information  systems,  have modified their strategies  to
focus on big data, utilizing  their existing  competency.
+ Google, Apple, and other mobile-based  emerging  companies,  are building  big data analysis  systems,  based on
existing  servers  and user data to provide  their services.
@ Differentiation  of big data service  delivery  domain
Companies  that are implementing  big data systems  are divided into those that provide  a total solution and those
that provide  solutions  in a specific  area.
+ Companies  like Amazon,  IBM, and Google create internal platforms  that support  the entire process  of big data
analysis  and provide  consulting  to other enterprises,  based on them generating  revenue.
+ Solution  companies  like Teradata  and Good Data that implement  functions, such as analysis  and visualization  for big
data, also strive to implement  unique performance.
B) Forecast  of big data systems
@ Still low versatility  of big data systems
Many technologies  related to Hadoop,  the leading technology  for big data, are currently  being developed to the
extent  that it has the Hadoop  ecosystem.  However,  it is still technically  too difficult  for non-engineers  to use, without
significant  help from engineers.
@ Growth  of open-source  big data systems
