[Figure 43] Plug-in  type database  encryption
It is recommended  to select this type when database  performance  is good, and the application  program is
difficult  or impossible  to modify.
@ TDE method
A method of using the built-in or optional  encryption/decryption  function  of the database.  This type can be
supported,  depending  on the DBMS type and version. There is no modification  to the application  program
because  encryption/decryption  is performed  at the DBMS kernel level. However,  this type may not be
supported,  depending  on the DBMS type or version. The selection  of this type can be considered  when
introducing  a new DBMS.

D) Applying  database  encryption
The concepts  of a one-way  cipher algorithm  and a two-way  cipher algorithm  can be applied  to the database  as
follows:
® Application  of a one-way  cipher algorithm
Original data extraction  by computation  should be made impossible,  using a hash cipher algorithm  (one-way
cipher algorithm),  and a cryptographic  hash function,  above SHA-256,  is generally  used.
Currently,  there are two cases when the one-way  cipher algorithm  should be applied: when data is saved in
plain text in the existing  database,  and when an insecure  hash cipher algorithm,  such as MD5 or SHA~1, is used.
