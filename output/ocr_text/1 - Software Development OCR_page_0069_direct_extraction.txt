and enormous  in an actual environment,  so it is better  to apply it in the form of a utility.
+ OCP (Open Closed Principle)
A class should be closed to modifications  and open to extensions.  It is related to
polymorphism  and abstraction,  which are the representative  characteristics  of object-oriented
programming.  When improving  functions,  it is desirable  to improve  inheritance  rather than
direct modification.  In addition,  abstract  classes should be implemented  in consideration  of
changes  in logic.
+ LSP (Liskov  Substitution  Principle)
This is the most important  principle  among the design for inheritance.  This principle  should
be followed  because  the IS-A relationship  is established  when a class is inherited.  That is, it is
related  to inheritance  which the superclass  can always refer to the subclass.
+ ISP (Interface  Segregation  Principle)
Communication  between  objects is established  using the interface  of the exposed  object.
This principle  is related to the exposing  method.  It should be designed  in such a way that a
different  type of interface  is provided  for each user. As an example,  we can consider  that the
interface  for general  users and administrators  should be different.
+ DIP (Dependency  Inversion  Principle)
When there is a using class and a used class, and the interface  of the used class is changed,
there is a dependence  which the change to the using class should also be checked. Even
though a slight change occurs, the reality is that it is difficult  to guarantee  its integrity  and
integrity.  Therefore, this principle  stipulates  that the design should be made as flexible as
possible  through  abstraction  using the interface,  so as to minimize  the possibility  of such
changes.
