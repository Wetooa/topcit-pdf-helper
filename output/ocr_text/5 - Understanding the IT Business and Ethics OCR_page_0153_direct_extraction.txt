but they are less efficient  because  they cannot  flexibly  handle  fluctuations  in demand.  However,  in a smart  grid, power
suppliers are able to flexible set the power prices and control the supply and consumers  can check their cumulative
power usage levels and the power prices. These two aspects  result in efficient  consumptions  of power. A smart grid
can also benefit producers  of renewable  energy sources  whose supply of power can often be unpredictable  because
power  from renewable  energy  sources  can be sold at high prices when the demand  for power  is at its peak.
A comparison  of traditional  electric  power grid and the Smart Grid reveals  the following  differences.

Control  system Local area control Wide area control
Pricing  information Limited  (monthly  total cost) Information  can be viewed in real-time
Pricing  system De facto fixed price Real-time  varying  price
ela Fluctuating  (demand  dependent) Almost uniform (price dependent)
Smart grids reduce greenhouse  gases, induce voluntary energy savings, and improve  the quality and reliability  of
electricity  through  improved  energy efficiency  and expanded  installation  of distributed energy sources  such as new
renewable  energy  sources.
The characteristics  of smart grids are as follows.
Consumers  can actively  participate.
Supports  many ways of generating  and storing  electric  power.
Leads to the creation  of new products,  services  and markets.
- Provides  high quality  electricity.
In a smart grid, consumers  receive information  about their energy usage pattern so they could change their energy
consumption  habits. In this way smart grid enables people to realize energy reductions  and gives them options
when they consume  electricity.  Furthermore, smart grids can be connected  to distributed power  generation sources
through  renewable  energy  while being connected  to centralized  large-scale  power  generation  sources.
