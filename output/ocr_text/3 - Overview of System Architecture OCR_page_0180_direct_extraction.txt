Overview  of System  Architecture
>p> Recent  trends and issues
As 4G wireless  communication  services  have become  popular, voice communication  is also implemented
through  data communication,  such as VoIP. The protocol  layer directly related to these applications  is
the transport  layer, and the network  can be used effectively,  only by selecting and using an appropriate
transport  layer protocol,  according  to the application  characteristics.
>> Learning  objectives
1, To be able to understand  the purpose  and functions  of transport  layer protocols  and use them,
2. To be able to understand  the concepts,  services,  and control techniques  of TCP and use them.
3 To be able to understand  the concepts,  services,  and control techniques  of UDP and use therm.
4. To be able to explain  the concepts  and basic operations  of SCTP.
TCP, UDP, SCTP, Flow control,  Error control, Congestion  control,  Slow start, SNMP. Multicasting,  NTP DHCP
Kerberos,  Multi-homing.
