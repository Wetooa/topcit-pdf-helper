+ When data is stored in plain text
If passwords  are stored in plain text and the hash cipher algorithm  is applied only to passwords,  they may
be vulnerable to  dictionary  attacks, such as Rainbow  attacks.  Therefore, the SALT value, which is a random
string, should be added to the user's password,  and the hash cipher algorithm  should be applied. Then, the
SALT value should be stored in a safe place.

+ If an insecure  hash cipher  algorithm  is used
If an insecure  hash cipher  algorithm,  such as MD5 or SHA~1, is used, the previously  stored hash value should
first be converted  into a double hashed value, by applying  the SHA-256  hash cipher algorithm,  before storing
it. Then, the data of the successfully  logged-in  user should be gradually  converted  into a single hash value,
using SHA-256,  before storing it. At this time, the login success  time should be used, or a separate  column
should be added in order to check whether  the data has a single hash value or a double hash value.
