E) Quantum  cryptography
Quantum  cryptography  is a cryptographic  technology  that utilizes the characteristics  of mechanics.  Unlike
existing  cryptosystems  that are based on mathematical  complexities,  quantum  cryptography  is based on
the characteristics  of quantum.  A quantum  cannot be copied or returned  to its original state. Due to these
properties,  the receiver  can detect an eavesdropping  attempt  when a third party measures  the quantum  for
eavesdropping  because  its state is changed  if measured.
F) Trusted  Platform  Module  (TPM)
The trusted platform  module (TPM) is a standard  established  by the TCG (Trusted  Computing  Group), an
international  industry  standard  organization,  to overcome  the limitations  of security  technology  that only
operates  with software.  This module provides  a strong security  environment  that stores important  data
that requires  security  in a secure space separated  by hardware,  such as the encrypted  key, password,  digital
certificate.  It ensures  that key management,  encryption  processing,  etc., are only handled inside the security
device.  The latest TPM 2 was released  in September  2016, which includes  the Mobile  Trusted  Module  (MTM).
G) Re-identification
De-identification  is the process or method of converting  data in such way that an  individual  cannot  be
identified.  Re-identification  is the process  or method of identifying  an individual  from the de-identified  data
by combining,  analyzing,  and processing  it with other information.  Personal  information  may be disclosed,  due
to intentional  or accidental  re-identification,  while collecting  information  from SNS or websites,  like search
engines,  or while companies  that handle personal  information,  such medical and financial institutions,  are
analyzing  data. Recently,  as big data is being used in various  fields, there is concern  that personal  information
may be leaked indiscriminately  due to re-identification.
H) EU-GDPR
EU-GDPR  is the personal  information  protection  law of the EU (European  Union) that took effect from May
25, 2018. Since administrative  measures,  such as penalties,  may be imposed  if the law is violated,  Korean
companies  need to pay attention so as not to violate  this law. The EU has enacted  the General  Data Protection
Regulation  to protect personal  information  and to provide opportunities for the utilization  of personal
information  at the same time, using the concept  of general personal  information,  anonymous  information,  and
pseudonym  information.
Major changes  to the GDPR are as follows:
@® Enforcement  regulation  (imposition  of penalties)
Whereas  the previous  EU Directives  were the regulation  at the recommendation  level, the GDPR is quite
different,  in that it is a mandatory  regulation  that all member  states must comply  with. (Penalties  are imposed
if violated.)
@ Extra-territorial  scope
The GDPR applies not only to the company  operating  a business  site in the EU, but also to the companies  that
process  the personal  information  of EU residents  in overseas  countries  through  e-commerce,  etc.
