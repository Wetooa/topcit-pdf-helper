04 Design  pattern
A) Concept  of the design pattern
The software  design pattern can be likened to the patterns  used to make clothes.  The design pattern
(omitting  software)  can be defined as “a general, reusable  solution  to a recurring  problem  in a specific context
of software  design.”  The design pattern is a description  or a sample of a problem-solving  method  that can be
used in various  situations.  It formulates  the best practices  that programmers  should implement,  and generally
represents  the interactions  or relations  between  classes  and objects.

[Figure 18] Classification  of design patterns
Design patterns  can be classified  as shown in the figure above according  to their purpose  and scope. Design
patterns  can be divided into the creation  pattern, structural  pattern, or behavioral  pattern depending  on the
purpose,
© Creation  pattern:  A pattern involved  in the process  of object  creation.
@ Structural pattern:  A pattern related to the composition  of classes  or objects.
@ Behavioral  pattern: A pattern that characterizes  the ways in which classes or objects interact  and distribute
responsibility.
Design patterns  can also be classified  according  to their scope. The scope indicates  whether  the pattern is
mainly applied  to classes  or objects.
@ Class pattern:  A pattern that handles  the correlation  between  classes and subclasses.  The correlation  is mainly
inheritance,  and is statically  determined  at compile  time.
© Object pattern:  A pattern  that handles  the object correlation  and can be changed  at the runtime.  It has dynamic
characteristics.
B) Representative  design patterns
Software  can be effectively  developed  using the design patterns  shown below, in order to improve  the
