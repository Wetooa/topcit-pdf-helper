@ Presentation
As with the rehearsal,  be confident  and concise  and clear in accordance  with the presentation  technique.
Post processing  (Q&A, feedback)
It is a step to answer questions  about the issues presented,  receive feedback  on the results of the
presentation, and check items to be improved.  If you prepare expected  questions  in advance,  you can answer
them without being nervous,  and you should be able to listen carefully  to the other person's  questions  and
explain  them in a humble  and calm manner.
C) Scenario  creation
When preparing  a presentation,  the most important  thing is the scenario.  Novice presenters  often make
the mistake of not writing presentation  materials  and writing scenarios.  Since the presentation  can be
nerve-wracking,  creating  a separate  scenario  in advance  and bringing  it with you will greatly ease the tension
during the presentation.
@® Content  Composition  of Scenario
Scenarios  derive and reflect important  presentation  points from presentation  materials.  Because  of the time
constraints,  the order of the points should be decided  in a way that the presentation  becomes  suitable  for the
audience,  purpose  (expectation),  and place. You need to write and check to make sure a lot of content  can be
communicated  efficiently,  by seeing  whether  the big flow of the story and keywords  are clearly identified.
@ Length of Scenario
Usually, it takes about 3 minutes  for each A4 sheet. Therefore,  it is necessary  to write  a scenario  for the
amount  of presentation  time given. Exceeding  the set time schedule  is what should be avoided  the most, and
scenario  should be structured  in a way that the presentation  can be finished within the set timeframe,  and
receive questions  and offer answers.
02 Writing  Techniques  of Presentation  Material
A) Overall material  composition
The entire material  is generally  organized  in the order of opening  — table of contents  — main text — closing.
+ The opening  is the time to show the presenter's  first impression,  and the success or failure of PT is
determined  within 30 seconds  of the start, and failure to build a positive impression  and trust becomes
difficult  to reverse.
* The table of  contents  should be structured  in consideration  of the length of the briefing session, and the
complexity  of the content.  Generally,  PTs within 30 minutes use a two-tiered  structure,  and a three-tiered
structure  for more than one hour.
* The main text can be divided into the following.
