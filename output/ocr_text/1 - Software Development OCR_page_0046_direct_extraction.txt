+ Amount  of variable  space: Storage  space that stores data and variables  used while executing  a program,  and
information  related  to function  execution.
@ Time complexity
This is the time taken to execute  and complete  an algorithm  as a program,  which is the sum of the compilation  time and the
execution  time.
Time complexity  = Compilation  time + Execution  time
* Compilation  time: Fixed time, which is not closely related to the characteristics  of the program.  Once
compiled,  the program  is kept constant  unless the program  is modified.
+ Execution  time: The program execution  time that is calculated  by counting  the number  of instances  of
command  execution,  rather than by measuring  the actual accurate  execution  time, as it depends  on the
performance  of the computer.
Execution  time is mainly used when comparing  algorithms  and is expressed  as O(n) using the Big Oh notation’
, which is expressed  as time complexity.  Execution  time functions  include logn, n, nlogn, n2, n3, and 2n,
depending  on the algorithm  (by Lee Ji-young).  To solve the problem,  it is recommended  to select an algorithm
with the smallest  value of time complexity  after creating  multiple algorithms  and calculating  the execution
time of each algorithm.

Complexity  notation Description
O(1) Constant  type. Finds the solution  regardless  of the input size.
O(log, Log type. Divides the input data and processes  one of them only.
O(N) Linear  type. Processes  all input data one by one.
O(Nlog,) Division and merger  type. Processes  data by dividing  and then merging  them.
O(N) Square type. When the basic operation  loop structure  is double.
O(N?) Cubic type. When the basic operation  loop structure  is triple.
O(2") Exponential  type. Processes  by testing  all possible  solutions.
1 To use Big Oh notation,  find an execution  time function  by calculating  the number  of execution  times and select a term for n,
which affects  the value of this function  most, and then place it in the right parenthesis  of O without  the coefficient.
