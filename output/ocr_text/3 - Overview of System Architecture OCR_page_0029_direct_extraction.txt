+ Web system  architecture
The architecture  runs the server's application  programs,  and the client uses the service with a web browser. It
generally  consists
performance,  andof a webserver,  a web application  server, and a database  server. The middleware  assures stable
the program  reusability is high. Although  the web system architecture  was limited by only
providing  web services  with a static display, the introduction  of HTML5, and the performance  enhancement  of PC
environments,  have enabled  them to provide services  in an impressive  GUI environment.  Most recent information
systems  use websystem architecture.  The client can use all the services  with a PC or mobile device, if the
environment  runs a web browser.

D) Classification  by system  layer
The function  and role of each system component  are classified  by tier, or layer The most widely known layer is the
OSI 7 layer, which shows the network  structure.  Layers and tiers are considered  similar  concepts  because  they both
represent  functions and rules in a tiered structure.  The most common  difference  is that layers refer to structures
from a logical point of view, and tiers refer to structures  from a physical  perspective.  An information  system  is divided
into a presentation ayer, a business  logic layer, and a data layer. This logical layer architecture  can be divided into an
N-tier structure  as a physical system architecture.  The typical N-tier structures  are a two-tier  structure  and a three-
tier structure.
Type
Presentation  layerDescription
This layer is at the highest  level of an application  program.  It provides  the service information  and the
interface  to users. This layer is also called GUI or front-end.  In a physical  tier structure,  webservers  and
client's  web browsers  belong  to this layer.
Business  logic layerThis layer runs the program  information  processing  rules that fulfill business  requirements  (business  logic).
It determines  which data is needed  according  to the business  logic, and it refers them to the data tier.
This layer is called the transaction  tier. In a physical  tier structure,  application  program  servers,  such as
WAS, belong to this layer.
Data layerThis layer accesses  data resources,  such as the database,  and reads or writes data. The data layer may
be divided into the data access layer and the data store layer. In a physical  tier structure,  the database
server  or file system  belongs  to this layer.
+ Two-tier  architecture
Two-tier  architecture  stores and processes  data in the server and processes  business  logic and presentation  for the
