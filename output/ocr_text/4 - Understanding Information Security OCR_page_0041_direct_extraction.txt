When the user requests  certificate  issuance  to the RA after applying  for subscription  and checking identity
at the RA branch, the RA sends the issuance  and registration  request  information  to the CA. The CA issues a
private key signed with the CA's private key, and posts it to the directory  serverthen  sends it to the user, via
the RA. The user stores the issued certificate  in a hard disk or a removable  disk of a PC and uses it in financial
transactions  and electronic  commerce.  At this point, financial  institutions  verify the certificate  by contacting
the public CA. [Figure 20] shows the participants  of the PKI and the workflow  between  them.
