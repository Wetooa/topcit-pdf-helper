®loT services  and interface
It is necessary  to use ontology-based  semantic  web technology,  cloud computing  for large-scale  distributed
processing,  and open API for accessing  various  services,  to automatically  analyze  and share data collected  from the
sensor  of an object.
D) Main loT protocols
Protocols  for loT require lightweight  the most, and since they have been commonly  used for some time, protocols
that feature compatibility  and scalability  are preferable.  In particular  CoAP and MQTT are suitable  for small devices
that need to connect  to the Internet  and transmit  data, due to the nature of loT, and are proposed  as communication
protocols  in various  architectures.
@ CoAP (Constrained  Application  Protocol)
CoAP is a lightweight  application  layer protocol,  developed  by the IETF CORE Working  Group, for communication
between  objects. Although  it uses the UDP transport  layer above the IP layer, it is designed  independently  of the
lower layers and can operate  in other networks  and transport  layers. It has reduced  the message  size to reduce end-
point load and uses binary  encoding  to facilitate  encoding  and decoding.

[Figure 148] CoAP Conceptual  Diagram
CoAP has attracted  attention  as the main protocol  for loT, since it communicates  with endpoints  using Zigbee, rather
than fast and stable Ethernet  or Wi-Fi.
@MQTT  (Message  Queue Telemetry  Transport)
MQTT is a publish-subscribe-based  protocol  for delivering  lightweight  messages  at low speed in high-latency  and
unreliable  networks.
