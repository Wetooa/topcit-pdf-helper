that could occur in an actual situation.
+ The table below shows the representative  white box testing  techniques.

Item Contents
Structural  technique Measures  and evaluates  the logical complexity  of the program.
Loop test Only the loop structure  of the program  is tested.
@ Black box testing
+ Black box testing  is called function  or specification-based  testing.
+ It is mainly used in system testing to verify both functional  and non-functional  requirements.  Functional
requirements  are verified  based on the specification, whereas  non-functional  requirements  are tested for such
factors  as performance,  availability,  security,  etc., based on the defined  specification.
+ Testing  focuses  on whether  software  runs according  to the requirements  specification.
+ Functional  testing and non-functional  testing  are performed  based on the requirements  specification  and the
external  interface, without  referring  to the internal  structure  of the software  module/component  or system.
+ The table below shows the representative  black box testing  techniques.

Item Contents
+ Tests are conducted  by selecting  test cases with various  input conditions.
Equivalence  partitioning + Eg. Testing  by separating  conditions  into x < 0, 0, x, 100, and x > 100 within the range of 1
to 100.
+ Tests the accuracy  of the result based on the boundary  value.
+ Eg. Testing  with x=0, x=100, x=-1, x=200, etc. within the range of 1 to 100.
Cause-effect  graph + Detects  an error by expressing  the impact  of input values  on output  values using a graph.
+ Detects  errors that could be overlooked  with sense and experience.
+ E.g. Checks  without  an input value or inputs a number  in the text field.Boundary  value analysis

03 Refactoring
A) Concept  of refactoring
@ Refactoring  overview
The term “refactoring”  refers to the improvement  of a program’s  internal structure  without  changing  the
program  operation  when viewed from the outside.  That is, the external  function  of the software  is not
modified,  but the internal structure  and relationship  are simplified  to improve  the maintainability  and quality of
the software.  The following  two points are important  in defining  refactoring.
+ Even if refactoring  is performed,  the program  operation  as viewed  from the outside  does not change.
+ Refactoring  improves  the internal  structure  of a program.
