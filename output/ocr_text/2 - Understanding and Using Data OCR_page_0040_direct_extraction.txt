Database )
+ Geometry,  a geographical  object, and topology  for the spatial relationship  between  objects  are included.
+ Unstructured  data can be processed;  large amounts  of data can be processed  quickly.
+ Spatial (topological,  geometric)  characteristics  are reflected,
+ New index and operation  (R-tree  index) are used to sort data that cannot  be sorted.
+ Expressive  data model that can express  complex  information.
+ Supports  the combination  of spatial data and non-spatial  data.
F) Column  base database
A column base database  physically  stores data based on columns.  The data storage method of the relational
database  is not defined  as row base or column base, but general relational  databases  use a physical  storage  structure
based on rows. However,  a way to store data with this structure  reached  the limit in analyzing  large-scale  data at
high speed because  its physical  structure  required  that unnecessary  data should be also read. The concept  of column
storage  did not suddenly  appear  recently.  Rather,  this concept  was studied  relatively  early on, including  TAXIR, which
was developed  in 1969 for searching  biological  information.  Recently,  as the demand  for the rapid processing  of large
amounts  of data increased,  a function  that partially borrowed  the concept  of the column store such as the column
store index, column store base DBMS, and hybrid DBMS supporting both structures  were developed  from the mid-
2000s. Column base database  technology  is now being actively used in the DBMS market, together  with the main
memory  database.
The column  base database  has the following  structure  and characteristics  compared  to the row-based  database.
