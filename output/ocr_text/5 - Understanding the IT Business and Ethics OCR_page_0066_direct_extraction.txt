Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
The IT business  process  is both a set of tools for implementing  IT business  and a procedure  that allows companies  to
continue  with their activities.  The IT business  process  can be divided into people, organizations,  and job process,  and
is intimately  tied to the core components  of enterprise  management.
IT business  processes  consist of business  process  management  (BPM) for managing  processes,  business  activity
monitoring  (BAM) for monitoring  process  bottlenecks,  the business  rule engine (BRE) for managing  the business
process  task rules, and BPR/PI,  an innovation  tool for processes.
The IT business  process  tools described  above form mutually  dynamic  relationships with each other, and through
these relationships  the process  undergoes  continuous  improvements.  The value of business  process  improvements
plays an important  role in enhancing  a company's  competitiveness  because  a system is created  that can respond
quickly  to changes  in its internal  and external  environments.
02 Component  Elements  Required  in IT Business  Process  Execution
(Business  Model)A  strategic  blueprint  for organizing  and implementing  an enterprise  organization's  structure,
processes,  and systems  to create value for the enterprise  is called a business  model. Made up of core business  areas
such as customers,  order, infrastructure,  and business  feasibility  analysis,  a business  model can enhance  the value of
an enterprise.
(Business  Execution)To  remain agile in a rapidly changing  business  environment,  the core business  processes  of
an enterprise  must be integrated  across its various departments  to give the enterprise  the increased  flexibility  it
needs to survive.  An enterprise  also has to take care of the underlying  assets that it needs to operate,  such as core
competencies,  finance, and human resources,  and have the infrastructure  to make decisions  quickly. There are the
basic elements  that an enterprise  must possess  to operate its business,  and these include the people who make
up the organization,  the job system for managing  the operation,  and the tools for managing  the business  of the
enterprise.
A) People  and Organization
People participating  in an enterprise  as members  of the organization,  and the organization  that carries out the
function  of dividing,  consolidating,  and connecting  different  jobs, are the key elements  of IT business  execution.
An organization  is an activity  or system consciously  created by more than two people. As such, it is important  to
maintain internal and external  balance,  effectiveness,  and efficiency  to fulfill their desires and common  objectives  of
communication,  volunteer  work, and collaboration.
Through  the division of functions  and responsibilities,  an organization  allocates human resources  so that it can fulfill
the agreed-upon  objectives  more effectively.
