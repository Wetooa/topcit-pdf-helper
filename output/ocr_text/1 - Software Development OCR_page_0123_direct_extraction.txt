04 Configuration  Management  Tools
Source code management  is one of the important  aspects  of software development.  A system is needed
to save and manage the source codes for effective  history management  of the various versions,  change
management,  and collaboration  between  the team members.  The system is called the VCS (Version  Control
System)  or SCM (Source  Code Management)  system.
Now let’s review the history of the software  configuration  management  system. At first, configuration
management  consisted  of version  updates  using a shared folder in the local, based on a file system.  After that,
distributed  management  became  popular  as the client/server  type management  system  based on the network
began to be used. The table below shows the configuration  management  tool by type.
A) Configuration  management  tools
The table below describes  the types, applied technologies,  and features  of the representative  configuration
management  tools. Subversion  and Git, representative  open-source  configuration  management  tools, and
