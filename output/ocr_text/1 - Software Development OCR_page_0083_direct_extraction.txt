+ State pattern
- Definition:  When a new state can be added to the internal state of a certain object continuously,  this
method facilitates  the addition of a new state. When the state of an object, including  the added state,
is changed,  the object state information  is defined and used as a class inheritance  structure  so that
performance  can be changed  without  modifying  the existing  source code.
- Advantages:  The sentence  that compares  state values inside the object is removed.  Helps maintain
information  consistency.
