+ Indexed  allocation
The linked allocation  cannot support  direct access and is difficult  to manage  the loss, since the block pointer
addresses  are scattered  throughout  the disk. The indexed allocation  solves the problem by managing  all
pointer  data of a file in an index block, as shown in [Figure 29]. The indexed allocation  does not create external
fragmentation  and supports  the direct addresses.  However,  the waste of storage  space is larger than the linked
allocation  method.
