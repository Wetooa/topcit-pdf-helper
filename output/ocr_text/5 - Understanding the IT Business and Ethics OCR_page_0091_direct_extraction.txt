@ SCM deployment  effects
Dell Computer,  the most successful  company  in introducing  SCM, said that after adopting  SCM it became  possible  to
link information  between  customer,  company,  and component  suppliers  in real time, and reduced  its inventory  from 8
weeks’  worth of supplies  to 12 ~ 15 days’ worth of supplies.
+ The introduction  of supply chain management  can improve  customer  satisfaction  by increasing  transportation
delivery  capacity and reducing  inventory,  reduce logistics  costs, and reducethe  customer  order processing  time
through  strict adherence  to delivery  schedules.
+ It can also improve  the efficiency  of fund flow by standardizing  work and by reducing  the product  delivery  time and
the order processing  time.
F) Understanding  CRM
CRM stands for customer  relationship  management.  It is a management  strategy  system for studying  customers’
tendencies  and requirements  in advance  in order to create the products  that customers  want and to develop
marketing  strategies.
Because  today’s customers’  knowledge  of product  and service information  has vastly increased  and customer
expectations  and customer  churn are higher than ever before, enterprises  are compelled  to establish  new business
management  strategies,  such as adopting  a customer-centric  corporate  structure,  establishing  diverse customer
interface  channels,  and implementing  customer  management  that leads to better  earnings.
To implement  these strategies,  enterprises  must analyze  customer  behavior  patterns  and consumption  patterns.  In
recent  years, enterprises  have felt the need to consolidate  internal/external  data and analyze  markets  and customers
to derive insights.  Big Data analysis  is a good example  of this.
