Overview  of System Architecture )
infrastructure  resources  provided  by laaS are generally  in a virtualized  environment,  it is not a must for laaS. The
service  that provides  non-virtualized  physical infrastructure  resources  is called a bare-metal  cloud. laaS users must
directly manage areas beyond the OS. The service is similar to receiving  a server that is hosting  from an existing
service,  provided  from the user's aspect.
@ PaaS
PaaS is a service method in which the concept  of SaaS is applied to the development  environment.  It uses the
necessary  development  and operating  environment  as a service, without  building a development  and operation
environment.  The service scope of PaaS ranges, from the application  development  environment,  to the service
distribution  and operation  environment.  PaaS provides the network  infrastructure  to the runtime for application
execution,  and the management  scope of the user is the applications  and data above the application  runtime.
For example,  a user developing  a new Java web application that uses MySQL as a database,  can quickly prepare  a
development/operation  environment,  and can quickly develop  and service applications,  by using PaaS service that
provides  MySQL  and Apache  Tomcat.
@ SaaS
SaaS is a service that provides  software  and is a model that delivers software  serviced  from the center to users,
through  a client, such as a web browser. SaaS users can use functions they need, without  knowing  where the
software  is located,  which OS it uses, and in which language  it is developed.  Leading  examples  of SaaS include  Google
Docs and SalesForce.com.  SaaS services  generally  have the following  characteristics:
+ Access  with a web browser:  Access  with a web browser,  instead  of an installed  software
+ Usage-based  cost: Paying  fees, based on software  use
* On-demand:  Needed  software  available  immediately
+ IT requirement  optimization:  No management  and scalability  issues with the IT infrastructure
