E) Principles  of requirements  management
The principles  of requirements  management  are as follows.
+ Giving priority to requirements-based  customer  value/obtaining  the stakeholders’  consent  to the
requirements.
+ Identifying  the exact target of the required  system  (expectation  management/scope  management).
+ Analyzing  the impact of a change to the requirements  by running  the Change Control Board (CCB), and
setting  a baseline  for each change  step.
02 Requirements  Specification
Requirements  should be defined by specification  techniques,  and the correct specification  can be defined only
when the principles  are considered.
A) Requirements  specification  techniques
Requirements  specification  techniques  can be divided into formal specification  and informal specification
depending  on the method.
