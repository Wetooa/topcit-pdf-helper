+ Operating  procedure  of the SSL protocol
[Figure 65] shows the main operating  procedure  of the SSL protocol,  and <Table 38> shows the operating
details of each phase.
Client 4@ Send a “Hello” message  for a SSL connection  request.
@® Send s server hello message, server certificate,  and public key.
e Create a session  key and encrypt  and send it with the session
key after verifying  the validity  of server  certification.
Gt  1nX Mla alms  ocr
Send signals  for exchanging  encrypted  data using the
algorithm  and key that were defined  through  security
negotiation.
Exchange  encrypted  data according  to the security  negotiated
cipher specification.

<Table 38> Operation  by phase of the SSL protocol
Sequence Description
Phase 1 The client sends a “Hello” message  to the server.
The server  sends a Server Hello message,  server  certificate,  and public key to the client, together  with a clientPhase 2certificate  request  if it is needed.
The client verifies  the validity  of the server's  certificate, creates  a session  for encryption,  and encrypts  it
Phase 3 with the server's  public key. If the cipher specification  and server  request  the client's  certificate, the client's
certificate  is also sent.
The client sends signals  to exchange  encrypted  data, using the algorithm, and the key is defined  in cipherPhase  4 paaane . -
specification  through  security  negotiation.
Phase 5 Encrypted  data is exchanged  according  to the cipher specification  for which security  negotiation  is performed.
® Utilization
+ Installing  an SSL certificate  in the server
An SSL certificate  should be installed  in the web server to apply SSL.  A certificate  signature  request
document,  called CSR (Certificate  Signing Request)  should be created and requested  to the certification
authority  after creating  a private key in the running  web server. Then, an SSL certificate  should be received
from the certification  authority  and installed  in the web server in order to set the web server. If the SSL
accelerator  is used, the certificate  can also be installed  in the SSL accelerator.
