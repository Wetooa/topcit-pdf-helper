O2 Types of System  Architecture
A) Types of system  architecture
Various ways of configuring  a system are provided.  System configuration  is changing  in various ways, according
to the changes  in hardware  and software  technology,  and the changes  to the user environment.  As the use of
mobile devices,  such as smartphones,  has recently  increased,  most systems  provide services  based on the system
architecture  centered  around a web service.  Moreover,  the system  layout is also changing  into a centralized  structure,
as the cloud services  have expanded.
B) System  architecture  classification  according  to system layout
Architecture  types can be classified  according  to the information  system  layout. The centralized  architecture  arranges
all the systems  in a centralized  place. Multi-region  distributed  architecture  operates  the system by distributing
regional  and application  systems  regionally.
@ Centralized  architecture
A centralized  architecture  stores and operates  the system and data from an integrated  center. It configures  an
integrated database  on a large-capacity  server and it has a relatively  simple system configuration.  Having an
integrated  database  makes it easy to assure data integrity,  and having all components  in one place makes them
convenient  to manage  and operate.  It can also quickly respond  to system failures. However,  all business  services  are
terminated  if the integrated  center  fails. Moreover,  the load is concentrated  during  peak time.

+ Multi-region  distributed  system  architecture
The multi-region  distributed  architecture  operates  the systems,  and the application  systems  are distributed
regionally. Each region manages  the distributed  data using small or medium-sized  servers.  This structure  can reduce
the load of each server, since it distributes  the user load. When there is a failure, only the regional  business  services
