recollection  can result in memory  space that is wasted without  being used. Using the first-fit, best-fit,  and worst-
fit techniques  to allocate  the memory  unit can cause external  fragmentation,  as shown in [Figure 22]. Let us assume
that a process  requests  64.450 bytes when there are 64,500 bytes of available space. In that case, 50 bytes of
available  space remains  after allocating  the requested  space. If the memory  is partitioned  into a fixed size to provide
multiple  fixed-sized  available  spaces to processes,  it may be slightly larger than the required space. The remaining
space is called the internal  fragmentation,  as shown in [Figure 23].
