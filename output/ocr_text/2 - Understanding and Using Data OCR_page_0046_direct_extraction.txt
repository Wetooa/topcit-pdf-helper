02 Considerations  for Database  Design
Database  design is the key area in the process  of database  build. The possibility  of a problem arising can be minimized
when proceeding  with the next phase only when each phase is clearly arranged  and the deliverables  are accurately
produced.
A) Deliverables  to be analyzed
@ Considerations  in the conceptual  model design phase
The meaning  of data and the rules of the correlation  between  data are defined in this phase. A conceptual  data
model should be created  as a deliverable  by defining  the subject  area, key entity, and relationships  in this phase.
@ Considerations  in the logical model design phase
Attributes  and keys should be defined based on the previously  created conceptual  data model: entities  should be
specified  accordingly:  and a final entity-relationship  diagram  should be created  after defining  history  management.
© Considerations  in the physical  model design phase
A physical schema is implemented  in a physical data model to implement  a database.  Semi-normalization  can be
performed  in consideration  of performance  in this phase. A table definition  document  reflecting  these requirements  is
created,
B) Considerations  of the design subject
A data architect  (DA) plays the most important  role in the database  design phase. The data architect,  who is directly
involved  from the phase of requirement  collection,  establishes  a data management  system and defines the data
standards.  In addition,  the data architect  manages  the overall data models that are created by conceptual,  logical,
and physical modeling.  However,  the performance  aspect should be considered  in the physical modeling  phase, to
ensure that the database  concerned  will work well regardless  of whether  the user requirements  are implemented.  At
this time, the database  administrator  (DBA) may review and reflect the physical  structure  area, such as the indexes,
partitions,  as well as the clustering  storage  space, and denormalization.
That is, the data architect  and the database  administrator  should discuss and determine  the final physical model
which they regard as the best from their own perspectives  in the physical modeling  phase, so as to achieve  efficient
and stable performance.
