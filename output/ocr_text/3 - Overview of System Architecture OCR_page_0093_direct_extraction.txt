@ RAID-1 (Mirroring  and Duplexing)
RAID-1 uses a mirroring  technique  that redundantly  stores data on two drives. Since data is stored in redundancy,
data can be restored,  even if a drive fails. It can improve  the reading  performance,  but the writing performance  is
somewhat  low, since it performs  reading  operations  on a drive with low I/O. Although  the system is highly stable, the
cost is high because  only half of the physical  capacity  can be used, as the other half is used for redundant  storage.

@RAID-5
RAID-4 has a separate  parity drive and collects and stores parities for data verification  and recovery.  RAID-5 is
an improvement  of RAID-4 by distributing  the load of the drive that stores the parities. At least three drives are
required,  and the data and parity are stored by distributing  them to different  drives. It is highly effective  in cost and
performance,  and recently,  most SSDs are configured  in RAID-5.  If three drives are configured,  data cannot  be restored
if two or more drives  fail.
