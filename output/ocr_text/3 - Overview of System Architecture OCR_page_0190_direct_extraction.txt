03 UDP (User Datagram  Protocol)
A) Characteristics  of UDP
User datagram  protocol (UDP) provides  a connectionless  service for sending  and receiving  data without  a pre-
configuration  process  for connection.  Unlike TCP. it is a protocol  that does not guarantee  the reliability  of the
transport  layer level.
Each user datagram  of UDP is an independent  datagram  and is not assigned  a number, unlike TCP. UDP is a very
simple protocol,  and there is no flow control, so there is no window  mechanism,  and packet overflow  may occur.
Error Control also has no other error control mechanism,  except for checksum.  When the receiver  detects  an error
through  a checksum,  the user datagram  is removed,  and congestion  control is not provided.  Due to this nature of the
UDP transport  protocol,  the application  layer may be necessary  in order to define and implement  the flow control
and error control. As described  above, since the UDP has a continuous  minimum  transmission  rate, despite some
packet loss, due to a lack of reception  confirmation  and retransmission  function,  it is suitable  for video play service
and is considered  to provide the best effort service. In particular,  for playing video that is transmitted  in real time,
the transmitting  side must separately  include the image frame order in the data. The receiving  side must store it in a
separate  buffer, according  to the frame order and process  it in order. In the case of a streaming  method,  instead  of a
download  method,  if there is a delay for more than a certain time, or if only the B and P frames are received  without
the | frame, the application  layer needs to maintain  the real-time  property  by destroying  the data.
The UDP protocol  is mainly  used for the following  purposes.
+ Aprocess  requiring  simple request-response  communication,  without  flow and error controls
+ Aprocess  with internal  flow and error control techniques
+ Multicasting  transmission  technology
+ Management  processes,  like SNMP
+ Route update  protocols,  such as the routing information  protocol  (RIP)
<Table 66> below shows well-known  ports for widely used UDP services.  It supports  the NTP service that corrects
the host time through  the network,  the BOOTP  and DHCP services  that are network  IP management  protocols,  the
TFTP service  that is simpler  than FTP, the RIP and OLSR services  that are routing  protocols,  and the Kerberos  service
that is a computer  network  authentication  protocol.
