Embedded  systems  control many devices  used in everyday  life. As shown in <Table 17>, embedded  systems  are used
in a wide range of areas, from portable  digital watches  and health bands, to large fixed facilities,  such as traffic lights,
factory  control devices,  and nuclear  power  plant control systems.H/W

B) Characteristics  of embedded  system
Since an embedded  system  performs  a specific  mission,  engineers  can optimize  the design in order to reduce  the size
and production  cost and to increase  reliability  and performance.
@ Low cost
Many embedded  systems  are mass-produced  in units of millions  and the reduction  of production  costs is one of the
crucial factors. Some embedded  systems  that do not require high processing  performance  or resources  can have a
relatively  slow processor  and small memory  in order to reduce costs.
@ Low performance
Many embedded  system parts have low performance.  Here, being slow does not simply refer to a slow clock speed. In
