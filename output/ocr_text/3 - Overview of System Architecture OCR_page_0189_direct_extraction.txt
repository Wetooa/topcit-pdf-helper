TCP mostly  uses four timers  for its operation.
<Table 65) Types  of TCP Timers
Timer  Type Description
+ A retransmission  timer is set to a retransmission  time-out  (RTO) value, which is the time to wait for
acknowledgement  by a segment  for retransmission  of a lost segment.
+ A persistence  timer is used for each TCP connection  to resolve  the deadlock  between  the receivingRetransmission
Persistenceand sending  TCPs.
Keepalive + Akeepalive  timer is used to prevent  TCP established  connections  from being idle for long periods  of
time.
Time-wait + Itime-wait  timer is used during connection  termination.  TCP performs  an active close, and the time-
wait timer is activated  when sending  the last ACK.
