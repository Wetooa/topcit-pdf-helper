+ ISO/IEC 20000 is an international  standard  which clearly defines the requirements  for IT service management
activities.  It was developed  by modifying  the BS15000  certification  of the BSI (British Standard  Institute),  the de
facto international  standard  and certification  specification  on IT service  management.
B) Understanding  ITIL
@ Definition  of ITIL
The IT Infrastructure  Library (ITIL) is a guideline  for IT management  developed  by the Central Computer  &
Telecommunications  Agency (CCTA) of the UK for public agency users in the late 1980s. ITIL is an IT service
management  framework  which is a compilation  of the best practices  in IT service management,  and which provides
standard  guidelines  for IT service management.
It also provides  a process  for clearly  and transparently  identifying  the complex  IT service framework  so that
enterprises  can realize  their business  objectives.
@ History  of ITIL
ITIL is an intellectual  property and a registered  trademark  managed  by the British government,  but it is effectively
used as a de-facto  global standard  for managing  IT services.
+ Version 1: In the 1980s, the British government's  CCTA developed  a standard  reference  document  to address
its reliance  on IT. In this version, several books on the specialized field of IT services  were collected  and
published.
+ Version  2: During  the period 2000~2001,  ITIL version  2 was announced  and an ITIL v2 glossary  was published.
+ Version  3: Version 3 was announced  in 2007 by the OGC, an organization  under Her Majesty's  Treasury,  and is
known as the ITIL 2007 edition. In July 2011, ITIL 2011 was published  as an improved  version of ITIL 2007.
Since then, the ownership  of ITIL has belonged  to the British  government.
