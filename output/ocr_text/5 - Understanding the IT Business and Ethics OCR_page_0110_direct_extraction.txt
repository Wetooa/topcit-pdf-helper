service quality agreed upon with the customers  can be delivered  and that the process  for increasing  customer
confidence  and improving  service levels can be managed.

[Fig. 44] Concept  and scope of SLM
SLM provides  the ability to manage  service level objectives  (SLO), which are the contents  of an SLA, and to notify an
enterprise  of any infringements  of the SLA. Therefore,  the implementation  of SLM is essential for managing  the IT
service  levels.

When operating  SLAs and SLMs, the evaluation  criteria for established  service levels must be specific, quantitative,
and objective.  The evaluation  criteria must be verified,  and seamless  setting  of the baseline  and smooth  management
of any changes  must be ensured.
