[Fig.4] The strategic  links between  business  and IT
To achieve strategic  alignment,  this model defines four areas that complement  each other: business  strategy,  IT
strategy,  organizational  infrastructure  and processes,  IT infrastructure,  and processes.  Each area has its own scope,
capabilities,  governance,  infrastructure,  processes,  and technology.
02 IT Business  Ecosystem
A) IT business  and the hype cycle
Now let's take a look at the changes  in the IT technology  environment  that have brought  about various  IT business
innovations  in recent  times. A diagram  that shows changes  in the expected  level of industrial  economic  value and the
impact  of new technologies  in the IT sector  over time is what the hype cycle from Gartner  (released  every year) is all
about.
In the hype cycle, the so-called  “innovation  trigger’  is the time when new technologies  are first introduced  and
people expect  great things from them. After that point, the level of expectation  gradually  increases  before the
new technology  starts to become  more exaggerated  than what it can actually  deliver, leading  to a period when the
bubble reaches its maximum  size (the peak of inflated expectations).  The Trough of Disillusionment  is the period
when the bubble bursts, after which the hype cycle enters a period of revival (the Slope of Enlightenment)  in which
the expectations  for the technology  start to climb steadily  once again. In the last period of the hype cycle, the
technology  transitions  to the Plateau  of Productivity,  the period when it generates  steady  values.
