01 Object-Oriented  Analysis  and the Modeling  Concept
Object orientation  takes a given problem area as a set of objects  that are present in the real world and
represents  the interaction  between  those objects.  This can be understood  as a virtualization  process  that
moves the problem  area to the computer  world in the same way as viewing  the real world. It has the advantage
of increasing  the reusability  of an object and deepening  the understanding  of the participants.  The object-
oriented  analysis  technique  identifies  an object required  by software  by applying  three viewpoints  (information,
dynamic,  and functional  viewpoints),  and finding  the properties  and behavior  of the object. The object-oriented
development  method has the advantage  of applying  the same methodology  and expression  technique  to the
entire software  development  process,  ranging  from analysis  to design and programming.
@® What is modeling?
Modeling  is the process of simply diagraming  the performance  or operation  process  of the target system in
order to analyze  it, or expressing  the characteristics  of the target system  mathematically.  We have to express
the real world to understand  it, and modeling  enables  us to express  the real world.
We should be able to  provide software  views from various perspectives  and understand  the requirements  of
software.  Modeling  results become  the key part of the requirements  specification  and provide  the information
needed to carry  out the next phase of the project. Modeling  results are used as a tool for dialogue  between
users and developers,  and are of great help in identifying  the requirements  needed  when starting  a project  and
in understanding  the system outline and frame that are needed in the development  stage (including  design,
implementation,  and testing).
@ Three viewpoints  of modeling
The use of software  varies depending  on the view. The view of software  can be expressed  in the following
three perspectives.

View Contents
The functional  model describes  a system from the viewpoint  of the functions
Functional  viewpoint performed  by software.  The functional  model is a viewpoint  about the output  of the
given input, and describes  the related  operations  and constraints.
The dynamic  viewpoint  describes  the state of the system  and the causes  of changesOe  eo (event, time, etc.) in its state by focusing  on the operation  and control of software.
The information  viewpoint  is used to understand  the static information  structure

oe characteristics  of that object as well as the relations and associations  between
objects.
@ Use case
If the use case technique,  which is well-known  in object-oriented  analysis,  is used, communication  between
customers  and system developers  can be smooth and customer  requirements  can be effectively  understood.
Use cases can provide many benefits  to the various stakeholders  of a given project, including  the customer,
