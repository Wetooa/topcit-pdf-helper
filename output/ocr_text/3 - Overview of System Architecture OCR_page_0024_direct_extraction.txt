Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Broad definition  of system  architecture
A system architecture  is a document  that defines  the structure  of an information  system provided  to support  the
business  process  required  to achieve  the objective  of an enterprise.  A system architecture  is divided into TA, which
defines the structure  of hardware,  such as a server, network,  and security,  as well as the distributed  structure  of
middleware  operating  on the hardware,  DA, which defines  the data structure  to assure data integrity,  and AA, which
defines  the software  components  and the relationship  and constraints  of said defined  components.
+ Narrow  definition  of system  architecture
A system  architecture  refers to the structure  of an information  system,  which includes  principles  and guidelines  that
define the components,  such as hardware,  software,  security,  interactions,  and constraints.  In other words, it refers
to TA and defines  the layout and connection  mode of the middleware,  such as the DB server and WAS, to distribute
the application  programs  of the developed system and hardware,  such as a server, storage,  and network.  The
following  table shows the types of detailed  architecture  defined  in system  architecture.
Type Description
It defines  the server  resources.
- CPU clock speed and number  of cores
- Memory  capacity  and network  card (NIC) performance  and count
- Type and capacity  of storage  units, such as SSD and SAS disk
- Server  type, such as rack-mount  type and blade type
- Server size from 1 unit to 4 unitsServer  design architecture
It defines  the network  of components  that provide  services.
- Capacity  of external  networks  (Bandwidth)
Network  design - Determination  of connected  switches  and routers
architecture - L4 switches  for load balancing
- Security  systems,  such as DDoS, IPS, and firewalls
- Network  addresses  used by services  (Subnet,  IP. and gateway)
It defines  separate  network  storage.
- Storage  capacity  and performance  (IOPS and bandwidth)
Storage  design architecture  | - SSD, SAS, and SATA media type as storage
- RAID configuration  type
- SAN, iSCSI, and NFS storage  network  type
B) Components  of information  system
@ Definition  of information  system
System components  are a configuration  of items to provide  the functions  of information  system services.  They
include a server that provides  the computing  power of an information  system, storage  that stores the data, a
network  that provides  communication  between  each component,  such as a server and storage, and security
to provide confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of the information  system. The detailed  components  include
computer  hardware,  OS, and middleware  operating  on a physical server. The following  diagram shows the details of
each component.
