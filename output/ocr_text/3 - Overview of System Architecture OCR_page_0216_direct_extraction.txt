[Figure 149] MQTT  Applications
MQTT is a flexible data transfer  model between  multiple  endpoints  and multiple  servers and operates  by publishing
and subscribing  to necessary  topics. [Figure 149] shows a conceptual  diagram  of transmitting  the topic of the door
opening  and closing, by sending pressure sensor data to the access control system, video security  system, and
building  energy control system, using Arduino and the metadata  topic that is generated  by the camera’s  image
sensor  to multiple  systems,  using MQTT.
Although  the protocols  based on CoAP and HTTP are widely  used currently,  the standardization  organizations  are still
suggesting  architectures  using MQTT and REST. OASIS continues  to update the MQTT standard.  [14]
