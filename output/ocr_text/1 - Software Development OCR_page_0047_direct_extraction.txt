E) Sorting  algorithm
@ Classification  of sorting
Sorting  can be classified  into internal sorting and external storing depending  on the sorting location.  The
alignment  method should be selected  in consideration  of the conditions,  such as the characteristics  of the
system in use, the amount  and state of the data, the memory  space required for sorting, and the execution
time.
+ Internal alignment:  A sorting method  that places a small quantity  of data into the main memory  device for
sorting.  The sorting  speed is fast, but the amount  of data that can be sorted is limited by the capacity  of the
main memory  device.
+ External  sorting: A method  of sorting  a large volume of data in an auxiliary  storage  device. A large amount
of data is divided into several sub-files  and sorted, and then the sorted sub-files  are merged in the auxiliary
storage  device. The sorting  speed is slow.
