02 OSI Reference  Model and TCP/IP  Protocol  Layer Structure
[Figure 13] shows  the concept  of the OSI reference  model communication,  which includes  the open relay system
described  in the standard  document  ISO/IEC  7498-1:1994(E)  [8]. The diagram  is often used when discussing  ISO's OSI
reference  model, or OSI layer, which is commonly  referred  to when dealing  with networks.  Here, ISO is derived  from the
Greek word “iooc (isos)’, meaning  ‘identical’,  andshould not be confused  with the English name of the International
Organization  for Standardization  (IOS). OSI is an abbreviation  of Open Systems  Interconnection.

<Table 2> shows in detail the protocol  and its function  of each OSI reference  model layer [1].
<Table 2) Protocol  and Function  of Each Layer of the OSIReference  Model
Layer Protocol Function
a HTTP. SMTP. SNMP. FTP The application  layer provides  services,  such as a user interface,  email,Application  layer
Telent, etc. and database  management.
Presentation  layer JPEG, MPEG, XDR, etc.The presentation  layer supports  the syntax  of data exchanged  between
two systems  and the encoding  translation  and encryption  related to the
semantic.
TLS, SSH, RPC, NetBIOS,Session  layery etc.The session  layer is for communication  sessions.  It establishes,
maintains,  and synchronizes  the interaction  between  communication
devices.
Transport  layer TCP, UDP, SCTP §The transport  layer provides  functions  like the reliable  message  transfer
between  end-to-end  processes,  as well as error control.
Network
layerIP. IPX, ICMP, X.25, ARP,
OSPF, etc.The network  layer supports  packet  transmission  between  networks
from the sending  point to the destination.
