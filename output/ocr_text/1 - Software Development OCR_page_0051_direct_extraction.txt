vertex. There are many cases in which problems  cannot be solved  simply by searching  for a graph node, such as
whether  one can travel from a certain city to another  city on the road network,  or whether  a terminal  is connected
in an electronic  circuit. Graph search methods  include  depth first search (DFS) and breadth  first search (BFS).
@ Depth First Search (DFS)
The algorithm  starts at the root node and explores  in one direction  of the starting  vertex as far as possible.  When
there are  no more places to  go, it backtracks  to the vertex with the last forked edge and continues  to explore
the edge of another  direction,  visiting  the vertices  until the target  node is found. A stack with a last-in-first-out
structure  should be used, since deep first search should be repeated  by backtracking  to the vertex of the last forked
road. Even though finding the shortest  distance  from the start node to the target node cannot be guaranteed
initially, the demand  for storage  space is low because  only those nodes on the current  path are memorized,  and the
target  node can be found quickly  if it is at a deep level. Also, this algorithm  is easy to implement.

@ Breadth  First Search (BFS)
The adjacent  nodes are searched  first after visiting  one starting  vertex. The vertices  adjacent  to the start vertex are
visited first, and the vertices  situated  farther  away are visited later. Breadth  first search must test whether  a certain
node has been visited and uses a queue, which is a data structure  that can retrieve  visited nodes sequentially.
