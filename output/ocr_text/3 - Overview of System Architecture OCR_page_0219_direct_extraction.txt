@ SDN applications
As shown in [Figure 152], network  devices  have had a control plane and a data plane implemented  in one device until
now. However,  when SDN is applied,  the controller  performs  the control plane function  of each network  device, and
only the data plane function  remains  in the actual physical  network  device.
Here, OpenFlow  plays a role as an interface  standard  technology  for SDN operation.
Controller
For example,  it removes  computational  operations  in medium and large routers and leaves only a simple switching
function.  Each router simply operates  according  to a command  issued by the controller.
C) NFV (Network  Function  Virtualization)
NFV has emerged  as a new topic, thanks to the high interest  of network  operators.  Moreover,  the NFV Group is
preparing  standards  for major telecommunications  operators  and equipment  manufacturers  and is promoting  a PoC
(Proof  of Concept)  to check the feasibility  of the technology.
