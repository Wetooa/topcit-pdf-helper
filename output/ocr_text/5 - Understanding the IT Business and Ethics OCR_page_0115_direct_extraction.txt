03 Balanced  Score Card Technique
A) Overview  of the BSC technique
The balanced  performance  evaluation  technique  is referred  to as BSC (Balanced  Score Card). BSC is a technique  for
managing  balanced  performance  by evaluating  not only financial  performances  but also non-financial  performances.
It was introduced  to the world by Harvard  Business  School Professor  Robert Kaplan and consultant  David Norton in
1992 in the Harvard  Business  Review.
+ The traditional  performance  management  system is so restricted  to financial  indicators  that enterprises  experience
difficulties  in executing  their strategies  in a systematic  manner. This has raised the need to consider  non-financial
evaluations.
+ BSC is utilized as a tool for maintaining  a balance  between  indicators,  for the concretization  and linking of strategies,
and for communication  within the organization.
