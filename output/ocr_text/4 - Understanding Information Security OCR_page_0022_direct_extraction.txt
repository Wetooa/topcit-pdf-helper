>>> Subject
Understanding  cryptography,  authentication  technique,  and access  control
>>> Recent  trends and major issues
The seriousness  of the problems  caused by the expansion  and development  of the cyber world
are increasing  day by day. Even Windows  and anti-virus  patch programs  are sometimes  distributed
after infection  with a virus or alteration.  From the viewpoint  of information  security,  various security
threats can be actively  responded  to by ensuring  confidentiality  and integrity.  Confidentiality  is
based on the concept  that data should be viewed only by authorized  and legitimate  users who hold
the right to access the data, whereas  integrity  is based on the concept  that data should be the
original data without  forgery  or alteration.  Therefore,  it is very important  to individually  or collectively
ensure confidentiality  and integrity  in information  security,  by applying  them while considering  the
characteristics  of each piece of data.
To be able to explain the concept  of ciphers  and classical  ciphers  to support  confidentiality.
To be able to explain private  key encryption  and public key encryption  algorithms.
To be able to explain the hash function  to support  integrity.
To be able to explain the hash function  to support  integrity.
To be able to explain the electronic  signature  and public key infrastructure  (PKI) for secure
transactions.
To be able to explain authentication  techniques  and authentication  methods  to control access.
