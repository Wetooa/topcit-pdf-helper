+ MBO sets goals whose levels can be measured  quantitatively  by the employees  through  their own decision.
+ Because,  in MBO, achievable  goals are set in a bottom-up  fashion, employee  goals are not necessarily  in full
alignment  with the enterprise goals. However,  employees  finalize their goals through  discussions  with their
supervisors.  Therefore,  when individual  employees  do meet their individual  goals, this can have a sufficiently  positive
effect on how close the enterprise  comes  to reaching  its corporate  goals.
B) The main reasons  why enterprises  are adopting  MBO
MBO begins with a clear understanding  of an enterprise's  objectives  and makes each individual  responsible  for
meeting  their own individual  goals. Also, under the MBO system,  efficient  organization  management  can be secured
since the members  of the organization  work hard to achieve  their respective  goals.
<Table  61> Main reasons  why enterprises  are adopting  MBO

+ To improve  individual  and enterprise  performance  by systematically  linking  the overall and
Goal alignment individual  goals of an enterprise.

Motivation  driver are motivated  to achieve the enterprise  goals.
Organizational + By developing  their abilities  and improving  their  job performance,  a foundation  can be built for all
integration the employees  to move in one direction.
However,  the goals set by MBO will likely not align with the goals of the enterprise  if the enterprise  does not set the
goals of MBO or provide any guidelines.  Consequently,  the goals have to be revised through  a separate  discussion
process. In addition,  special care must be taken when adopting  MBO, because  if the goals of individual  employees
conflict  with each other, it could lead to serious  disputes.
C) Component  elements  of MBO
From the very goal setting stage, MBO encourages  the participation  of supervisors  and subordinates.  Therefore,  the
MBO approach  works interactively  to align the goals with the enterprise  strategies.  In addition,  continuous  feedback  in
the form of evaluations  and encouragement  is needed  to align the MBO of employees  to the goals of the enterprise.
<Table  62> Component  elements  of MBO
