C) Distinguishing  Al
@ Definition  of the Turing test
+ Atest of a machine's  ability to exhibit  intelligent  behavior  equivalent  to, or indistinguishable  from, that of a human.
+ In a given problem-solving  thinking  situation,  if the evaluator  cannot reliably tell the machine  from the human,  the
machine  is said to have thought  in the same way as a human being.
@ Principles  of the Turing  test
+ The Turing test is a kind of game designed  to test whether  a machine  can have intelligence.
+ In the ‘Imitation  Game’, people and machines  are isolated  in different  rooms and communicate  by teletype.
+ The people try to confirm  that the other party is a machine  by asking it questions,  and the machine  tries to lead
the people to believe  that it is a real human through  its answers.
+ If the machine  wins the game, the machine  can be said to have Al.
D) Machine  learning
@ Definition  of machine  learning
+ Aprogram  that can solve problems  in a new situation  while learning  new knowledge.
+ Science and technology  study a system that improves  its performance  by itself using empirical  data based on
interactions  with the environment.

Classification Description Learning  problem
A machine  learning  method  that uses learning  data, which describes  theintended  result. Classification,  regression,
