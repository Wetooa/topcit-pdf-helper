Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
For the efficient  implementation  of PI, all executives  and employees  of the enterprise  must be familiar  with and share
in the vision of change.  The activities  and resources  needed  for implanting  change  must be organized  and strategies
must be developed.  The CEO must display strong leadership  and active participation.  Leaders  should encourage
the completion  of changes,  take responsibility  for activities,  and encourage  active participation  by the stakeholders.
Leaders  must also turn the management  vision into reality and increase  the ability of individuals  and teams to
perform  their  jobs effectively  in the new environment.
PI can be established  stably only if change management  with PI is successful. An organization's  ability to adapt to
change  will eventually  determine  the success  or failure of the project.
C) Understanding  Six Sigma
@ Overview  of Six Sigma
“Six Sigma’ is a quality innovation  movement  that was started by Motorola  in 1987 with the aim of achieving  a defect
rate of less than three out of one million products  and of reaching  the so-called  “6 Sigma’  level of quality  by analyzing
and quantifying  the causes of inefficiencies  in management.  Thus, the three main pillars of Six Sigma are statistical
measurement,  business  strategy,  and philosophy  (transformation  of the way work should be performed).
@ Characteristics  of Six Sigma
+ The statistical  measurement  of process innovations  is critical. Quantification  and objective  measurements  are
performed.
+ It is an enterprise-wide  process  innovation  activity  that is not limited to a specific  department,  team or area.
+ Its ultimate  goal is to improve  the value and satisfaction  perceived  by customers  who are at the end of the value
chain.
+ “Six Sigma’ strives for a passionate  organizational  culture in which all members  of an organization  participate  in the
pursuit  of continuous  improvements.
