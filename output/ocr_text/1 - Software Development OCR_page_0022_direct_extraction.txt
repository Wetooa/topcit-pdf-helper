02 Lifecycle  of Software  Development
A) Definition
The lifecycle  refers to the entire process  from understanding  the user environment  and problems  to operation
and maintenance.  The general  software  life cycle is composed  of [Feasibility  review  — Development  planning  >
Requirements  analysis Design  — Implementation  — Test — Operation  — Maintenance]  activities.
B) Purposes
+ To calculate  the project  costs and draw up a development  plan, and to configure  the basic framework.
+ To standardize  the terms.
+ To manage  a project.
C) Selecting  a software  lifecycle
+ This is an important  activity  for corporations  to tailor the development  process  of a project.
+ Selection  is based on the risk and uncertainty  of system development  and understanding  of it.
+ The selected  model should be able to minimize  the risks and uncertainties  associated  with a given project.
+The Waterfall  model, prototype  model, evolutionary  model, and incremental  model are the most
representative  life cycle models.
D) Types of software  lifecycle  models
The lifecycle model does not explain all possible  lifecycle models  that could be applied to a project: rather,
it is an example  of the most frequently  used lifecycle  model. In addition,  the lifecycle  model can be replaced
according  to the characteristics  of the project.
@® V model
* This model clearly shows the activities  that should be performed  while implementing  the project  to project
managers  and developers.  It also helps customers  who do not know much about this area to understand  the
principles  of software  development.
+ An ideal lifecycle  model identifies  and clarifies  all system  requirements.
* The V model can be used even when the requirements  are unclear. However, the estimation,  planning,  and
confirmation  of a project are limited to the requirement  analysis  and identification  phase only. That is, the
detailed plan to which the V model is applied is finally completed once all the requirements  have been
identified  and clarified. If the requirements  are not clear, the initial project plan should specify the start/
end dates expected  by the customer  and the estimated  date when major risks, assumptions,  dependencies,
and requirements  have been identified  and clarified.  A project involving  the implementation  of a standard
communication  protocol  is a typical example  of the type of project  to which the V model can be applied.  The V
model has the following  characteristics.
