A) Definition  and classification  of Al
© Definition  of Al
Alis a technology  that realizes  human  learning  ability, reasoning  ability, perception  ability,  and natural  language  understanding
ability by using computer  programs.  The dictionary  meaning  of Al is based on a philosophical  concept,  which is created  by
humans  or intelligent  beings or systems.  In the past, Al had the narrow  meaning  of “software  that enables  computers  to imitate
human intelligence  behaviors”.  More recently,  however,  the meaning  of Al has come to include  a technology  that studies  how to
enable  computers  to perform  the kinds of thinking, learning,  and self-development  that can be done with human  intelligence.

Three elements Description Case
Weak Al/Artificial  Narrow  Intelligence:Operable  only under  given conditions.Recommendation  by Google Maps,
Autonomous  Car, Google  Translation,  and
an Facebook
Strong  Al/Artificial  General Terminator,  secretary  robot, factoryintelligence:  AGI Al that can think like humans. robot, etc.
Artificial  Super Intelligence:  ASI Al that surpasses  humans  in all areas.A high-level  command  is possible,  such
as “Create  a new energy  source  that can
be used by people  for the next 1,000
years.”
