B) Types of computer  architecture
The types of computer  architecture  include the von Neumann  architecture,  which is a structure  that applies the
stored-program  design principle'  , suggested  by von Neumann  in 1945, and the Harvard  architecture  which separates
instruction  memory  and data memory.  As shown in [Figure 31], these two types have different  memory  structures,
and each has advantages  and disadvantages.
+ Von Neumann  architecture:  The CPU can read commands  from the memory  and can read and write data both from
the memory  and to the memory.  Instructions  and data cannot be accessed  simultaneously  because  they use the
same signal bus and memory.
+ Harvard architecture:  It solves computer  bottlenecks  by storing commands  and data in different memories  and
improves  performance  by reading  and writing commands  in parallel. However,  the bus system design becomes
complex.
