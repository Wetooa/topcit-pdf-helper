+ Preview  for practical  business AlphaGo,  the Al that beat one thousand
years of human learning
The match pitting Lee Sedol (a Go player with the 9 ‘dan’ rank) against  AlphaGo's  Deep Mind Challenge,
held from March 9 to 15, 2016, was a shocking  event that showed how artificial intelligence  could far
surpass  human learning  ability. The fact that AlphaGo  defeated  Lee Sedol, the world's  No. 1 player  for more
than a decade and also one of the strongest  players in the world of Go since 2014, was a clear  sign that
artificial  intelligence  can overcome  human learning  skills that have evolved  over many thousands  of years.
