[Fig. 33] Life cycle of enterprise  customers
+ Enterprises  can gain opportunities  to acquire new customers  through  focused marketing  or promotional  activities
that target responsive  customers  among potential  customers  in the target market who show interest  in their
products.
+ Enterprises  should strategically  manage  customers  who purchase  their products  as well as high-value  (highly loyal)
customers.  To this end, enterprises  should have a system in place that can sort their customers  based on such
criteria  as personality,  type, and interests,  and provide  their services  and conduct  their marketing  accordingly.
+ This requires  an entity to establish  a strategy  for maximizing  customer  lifetime  value, i.e. the total value generated
throughout  the customer's  lifecycle, rather than the temporary  profitability generated  by individual  transactions.
This is the goal of CRM.
© Definition  of CRM
The CRM defined by Gartner  is ‘a strategy  for optimizing corporate  sales and expanding  the customer  base by
creating  and supporting  relationships with profitable  customers.  In other words, CRM is a management  technique
that integrates  and analyzes  customer  data across the enterprise  and customer-related  data inside and outside  the
enterprise,  and then provides  the findings  to customer  points of contact  for use in interactions  with the customers.
This is an integrated  process  that enables  enterprises  to continually  deliver the products  and services  customers
want, based on an accurate  understanding  of the customers,  thereby  maximizing  customer  lifetime value and
increasing  profitability.
@ CRM Classification
From  a process  perspective,  CRM collects  and analyzes  the various data generated  by the entity and provides  it with
meaningful  information.
CRM can be classified  as analysis  CRM, operations  CRM, or collaboration  CRM. With analysis  CRM, information
generated  through interactions  with customers  is gathered,  and meaningful  insights  are derived and then supplied  to
the enterprise.  With operations  CRM, these insights  form the backbone  of marketing,  servicing  and sales activities.
Finally, with collaboration CRM, the enterprise  engages  in interactions  with the customers  through  a diverse range of
channels.
