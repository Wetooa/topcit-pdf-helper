802.1X authentication,  4-way handshake  key exchange,  and CCMP (Counter  Mode With CBC-MAC  Protocol)
encryption  algorithm,  as essential  functions.
@ IEEE 802.11i components
The security  standard  of IEEE 802.11i defines the following  services.  [Figure 68] shows the structure  of the
security  protocol  and encryption  protocol  used to provide  these services.
+ Authentication:  The user and the authentication  server (AS) should authenticate  with each other using the
protocol,  and a temporary  key, to be used between  the client and the AP on the wireless link, should be
generated.
+ Access control: Proper message  routing and key exchange should be performed  using the authentication
function.  This function  can be performed  together  with various  authentication  protocols.
+ Privacy through  message  integrity:  MAC layer data is encrypted  together  with message  integrity  code, to
guarantee  that it is not been tampered  with.
