<Figure  25> Example  of traceability  by sentence
When traceability  is given to each requirement  in the development  deliverables,  as shown above, we can clearly
understand  how the marketing  requirements  are reflected  in the system requirements,  and which subsystems
are allocated  and reflected  in the design. In addition,  we can estimate  the addition  development  M/M caused by
changes  to the marketing  requirements  requested  by the user; understand  how the upper-level  requirements
are affected  when developers  try to change some of the design requirements  at their own discretion;  and
identify  the requirements  that were omitted  in the intermediate  steps.
The tracking  of requirements is only effective  when managed in units. The following  values can be obtained
when tracking  management  is performed  for each requirement  in all the document  deliverables  requiring
tracking  management.
+ Reduces  the need for re-working  by preventing  the omission  of higher-level  requirements.
+ Raises the quality  of individual  requirements  by securing  traceability  (clarity,  traceability,  testability,  etc.).
+ Analyzes  the impact  of changes.
+ Enables  effective  collaboration  between  various  teams/companies.
+ Secures  test coverage  and improves  product  quality by securing  traceability  with test cases.
+ Secures  consistency  between  deliverables  via the management  of various  changes.
+ Increases  productivity  by reducing  incorrect  communication  caused by changes.
