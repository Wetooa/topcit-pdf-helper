02 Fault-Tolerant  System
A) Fault-tolerant  system
A fault-tolerant  system can continuously  perform  the functions  specified in the design, even if a system part fails. A
fault-tolerant  system cannot use certain functions  when a component  fails. When components  continue  to fail, the
unavailable  functions  gradually  increase,  and the system  shuts down when a critical  failure occurs.
[Table 23] Troubleshooting  Steps
Step Description
Fault detection - Analyzes  which module  has caused  fault, through  comparative  logic.
Fault diagnosis- Determines  whether  the fault is temporary  (transient)  or permanent  (hard) and excludes  the hard
module  from an operation.
Fault isolation - Blocks  the spread of errors by fault.
Fault recovery - Eliminates  the module  that caused  the fault in order to recover  and reconfigure  the system.

Technique Type Description
General  faulttolerantCheckpoint  technique Error detection  for source  code that may cause a fault
Application  of fault-tolerant  technique,  through  protocol  monitoring  andtechnique Protocol monitoring -

Triple modular Configuration  of modules  in triple redundancy  so that three or more
Redundancy processors  perform the same operation  for the same inputs
Hardware  tolerant |_RAID Fault tolerance  through  disk mirroring  and distributed  storage  of parity bits
technique Duplication  with Comparison Hardware  redundancy  for fault detection
Stand by Sparing Use of spare hardware  for fault detection
Watchdog  Timer Initialization  with periodic  timer operation
Checkpointer Rerun from the point of the checkpoint,  when there is a fault
Software  tolerant Recover  block Rollback  and retry of a single processor
technique Conversation Processing  between  multiple processors
Distributed  rollback Rollback  technique  in a distributed  environment
03 Disaster  Recovery  System  (DRS)
A) Definition  of DRS
DRS is an overall plan and system to minimize  the impact of a disaster  on a business,  by locating all or part of the
information  system  infrastructure  in a location  different  from the disaster  point,then  quickly  recovering  from a disaster
