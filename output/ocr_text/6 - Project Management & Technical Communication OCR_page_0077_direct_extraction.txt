Project management  methodologies  and processes  are influenced  by the organizational  structure  or
application  method  of the company.
The Waterfall  methodology  is a classical  model to perform a project with one single sequence  and
can develop  into an iterative  or adaptive  life cycle through  overlapping  or repetition  of the sequence.
If the Waterfall  methodology  is based on planning,  Agile is a value-oriented  methodology.  Scrum
improves  project  productivity  through  active cooperation  and communication  between  people rather
than formalities.
In the domestic  development  environment,  there are cases where it is difficult  to apply Agile
methodology  in a vertical  structure  or a power imbalanced  relationship  between  the acquirer  and the
supplier.

A project has a certain cycle, which is generally composed  of five processes:  initiating,  planning,  executing,
monitoring  and controlling,  and closing, and if the project is stopped  in the middle, the closing process  is im-
mediately  executed.
