Database )
A) Requirements  collection  and analysis
@ Collect  and analyze  the business  requirements  of the user.
@ Create a requirement  statement  as a phase deliverable.
@ Identify  both static and dynamic  structural  requirements.
+ Static structure  requirements:  Entity, property,  relationship,  constraint,  etc.
+ Dynamic  structure  requirements:  Transaction  type, frequency,  etc.
B) DB design
A data model is a design document  for building a database  that has a clear goal. In the real world, a database  is
created  over time, as shown below. Depending  on the level of abstraction,  the design can be divided into a conceptual
data model, a logical data model, and physical  data.

[Figure  9] Process  of creating  a database  in the real world
First, conceptual  data modeling  is performed  to embody  the database  at the higher level that has a high level of
abstraction  in the real world. The conceptual  data model has a high level of abstraction,  focuses  on business,  and
performs  modeling  at the comprehensive  level. This model is frequently  used for enterprise  data modeling  and EA
establishment.  For reference, when deploying  EA-based  enterprise  data modeling,  general data modeling,  which is a
higher level, is performed  first, after which conceptual  data modeling  is performed  for each business  area. When an
entity-centered  data model is completed  at the higher level, a data model with a focus on concrete  business  can be
created  according  to a concrete  business  aspect  and flow, which is called “logical data modeling’.  In addition,  a method
that considers  the tablespace  according  to the storage  structure  of the database  is called “physical  data modeling”.
