Strategy Explanation
This strategy  is adopted  when risk elimination  is not possible. Passive  acceptance  and active
acceptance  are selected  when appropriate  response  strategies  cannot be established.
+ Passive  acceptance:  No action is required  other than documenting  the strategy  and the risk
incurred  is handled  by the project  team.
+ Active acceptance:  actively  build a contingency  reserve,  including  time, capital,  or resources  to
deal with the risk.Acceptance
Positive risk response  strategy  is a method of dealing  with risks that can have  a positive  impact on the proj-
ect objectives  and includes  Exploit,  Share, Enhance  and Acceptance.
<Table 68> Positive  Risk Response  Strategy
Strategy Explanation
+ An activity  that eliminates  uncertainty  so that opportunities  are evident  during the
Exploit project's  execution  period, requiring  actions such as reducing  the cost of provision  or
dedicating  competent  resources  to shorten  the completion  time.
+ If there is a positive  impact on the progress  of the project,  ownership  of the opportunity  is
Share shared with other organizations  to realize opportunities,  including  establishing  partnerships
with risk-sharing  partners  and special-purpose  organizations.
+ As a strategy  to maximize  the probability  and impact  of an opportunity,  it identifies  the
Elie main causes and take action to maximize effectiveness
Acceptance + Choose  to take advantage  of opportunities  but not actively  pursue them so that risks arise
E) Risk Control
Risk control is a process  for implementing  a risk response plan, tracking and managing  identified  risks, mon-
itoring residual risks, identifying  new risks, and evaluating  risk management  activities.  Assessing  the effec-
tiveness  of a risk response  by monitoring  the identified  risks and investigating  and documenting  whether  risk
management  is effective.
<Table 69> Risk Control  Method
Method Explanation
+ Perform  on a regular  schedule  with activities  to identify  new risks as a result of riskRisk Reassessment :monitoring  and control,  reassess  current  risks, and terminate  outdated  risks.
+ Investigate  and document  the effectiveness  of risk countermeasures  addressing  theSSeS identified risks and root causes, and the effectiveness  of risk management  processes.
+ Analyze  the difference  between  planned  and actual outputs,  and review trends inVariance  and Trend Analysis - : ; ; ais project execution using performance  information  for event monitoring  and controlling
+ Technical  performance  during project  execution  is compared  to the technical
performance  schedule  in the project  plan, and technical  performance  is measured  by
weight,  number  of transactions,  number  of defective  deliveries,  storage  capacity,  etc.Technical  Performance
