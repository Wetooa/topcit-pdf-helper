ESSENCE
in daily life. It is also used in mechanical  keyboards  that provide  functions,  such as various shortcut  keys and infinite
key inputs. It is also in a TV or air conditioneras  well as in the remote  control that controls  the TV and air conditioner.
Moreover,  it is in game consoles,  car trip computers,  and smart keys.
While Intel and AMD are everything  when it comes to CPU for computers,  many companies  make MPUs. Many
companies,  like Broadcom,  Mediatek,  Samsung  Electronics,  Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm,  and Texas Instruments,  make
MPUs used in electronic  devices.
As shown in <Table 19>, various  CPU architectures,  from 8-bit to 64-bit, such as ARM, MIPS, ColdFire/68K,  PowerPC,
x86, PIC microcontroller,  and 8051, are used for embedded  systems.  That is what differentiates  the embedded  system
market  from the personal  computer  market.
Moreover, one of the latest trends of embedded  systems  is the System on Chip (SoC) concept  that integrates  all
ICs for a specific  field into a single CPU chip in order to eliminate  the need to mount separate  peripheral  chips on the
board.

B) Technical  trends  of embedded  hardware
@ Expanded  connectivity
Studies  of applying  connectivity  technologies,  such as WiFi, LTE, BLE, and ZigBee, used by mobile devices and
servers/PCs,  to embedded  systems,  have increased  with the convergence  of the IT industry.  Traditional  industries  and
interoperability  between  devices,  such as loT and M2M sensor  networks,  have also become  important.
@ Low-power  32-bit processor
Processors  for embedded  systems  were mostly converted  from 8 bits to 32 bits. As such, the number  of
embedded  systems  using an OS has rapidly increased,  and the portion of general-purpose  OS, like Linux, has
significantlyincreased.
© Polarization  of lightweight/general-purpose  OS
Embedded  operating  systems,  supporting  wearables  and loT devices, require lighter weight and lower power
consumption,  while operating  systems  applied to conventional  embedded  devices  include middleware,  related to high
functionality,  and stability  and convenience  functions  like 3D acceleration  GUI and multimedia.  As a result, technology
polarization  is accelerating.
