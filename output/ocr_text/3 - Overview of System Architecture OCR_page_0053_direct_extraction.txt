© Solving  the fragmentation  problem
* Compaction  technique:
The compaction  technique  merges small-sized  available  memory.  It is used to remove  the external  fragmentation
that generated  in a variable-size  memory  partition  system, as shown in [Figure 24]. The technique  is not widely
used because  it is complex  to implement,  and it causes  overload  as it requires  a long time.

* Coalescing  technique:
The coalescing  technique  merges  spaces  with adjacent  addresses  in the unused empty space list in order to create
a larger space and to prevent  multiple  small spaces,  as shown in [Figure 25].
