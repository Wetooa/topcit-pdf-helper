[Figure 18] Concept  of multi-factor  authentication
To implement  a more powerful  multi-factor  authentication  system, it is desirable  to mix and use various
authentication  technologies,  based on knowledge,  ownership,  and presence,  such as OTP + fingerprint
recognition.
D) Electronic  signature
@® Concept  of the electronic  signature
An electronic  signature  is a technology  that enables  the user to sign on an electronic  document  using the
authentication  function  of encryption  technology,  as shown in [Figure 19]. The effect of an electronic  signature
can be obtained  by authenticating  the identity  of the signer, by using the authentication  function  of the public
key cryptographic  technique,  while authenticating  an electronic  document  to be signed at the same time.
The basic assumption  of the public key encryption  system is that the user (owner) will securely and secretly
keep the private key (secret key), which becomes  a pair of the public keys. If a certain signing operation  is
performed  using the private key in this environment,  it can only be performed  by the user who has the private
key, and the result  can be recognized  as the user’s signature.
The sender  sends a message  using public key cryptographic  techniques,  together  with an electronic  signature,
which is the result of encrypting  the message  digest (hash value of the message)  with the private key. Then,
the receiver  checks the sender authentication,  non-repudiation,  and message  integrity,  by comparing  the
result of decrypting  the sender’s  message,  using the received  electronic  signature  with the message  digest
value that was calculated  by using the received  message.
