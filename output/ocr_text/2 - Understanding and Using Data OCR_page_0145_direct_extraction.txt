technology?
Although  interest in data analysis has increased,  the existing  system architecture  and DBMS face
limitations  in terms of processing  speed and performance  when an existing  analysis  system  processes  tens
of PBs of unstructured  data generated  by multimedia,  SNS, sensors,  loT, etc., due to the advancement  of IT
technologies.  As a result, solutions  are being developed  that are suitable  for analyzing  the large volume  of
unstructured  data (variety)  generated  at high speed (velocity).  Technologies  related to big data, which was
still in its infancy  only a few years ago, have developed  rapidly and are now being used directly in our real
life.
There are many examples  of this. For instance,  the US movie Minority  Report,  which was released  in 2002,
portrayed  futuristic  crime prediction  by “precogs’  in the year 2054, yet something  akin to this technology
was actually  realized as a crime prevention  system in San Francisco  as early as 2009. (However,  the
concept  of “big data” had only been introduced  at that time for the study of genomes,  and prediction  based
on big data analytics  had not yet been thought  of) Other commonly  known examples  include Google's  flu
map, the US presidential  election  case, ZARA, the DHL case, and distribution  demand  forecasting.
Furthermore  big data technology  was unfamiliar  to IT workers  until relatively  recently  to the extent that
they only needed to know the definition  of big data. However,  with the rapid development  of big data
technology,  terms such as crawler, Hadoop,  MapReduce,  R, and NoSQL, as well as the 3V characteristics
of big data, have become  familiar  technical  terms, and IT workers  now experience  big data systems
more frequently  in the workplace.  Therefore,  IT workers  need to understand  at least the concepts  of the
technical  terms for each phase of big data analytics,  if not the detailed  technical  principles,  in order to
quickly  adapt to the changed  workplace.
