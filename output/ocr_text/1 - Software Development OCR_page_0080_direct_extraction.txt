+ Flyweight  pattern
- Definition:  A design that separates  information  into shareable  and non-shareable  information  in order to
share information,  and which defines  shareable  information  as an object  and performs  information  sharing.
- Advantages:  Storage  space can be reduced,  and multiple  objects  can be handled  easily.
+ Proxy pattern
- Definition:  A pattern used to represent  a complex  object or an object that takes time to create within a
simpler  object. As creating  an object uses many resources  and/or takes a lot of time, this pattern delays
