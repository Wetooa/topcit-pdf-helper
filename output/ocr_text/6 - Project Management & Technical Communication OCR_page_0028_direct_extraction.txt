For example,  “Status Analysis”  can be decomposed  into business  environment  and the 3C analysis  according
to the MECE principle  and if each component  of the next step is decomposed  into a tree form according  to the
MECE principle,  the given key content  can be checked.
© The 80-20 rule
The 80-20 rule was discovered  by an Italian economist  named Pareto who found out that the top 20% of
people have 80% of their total wealth, while analyzing  the distribution  of income in Europe. The 80-20 rule is
found in many cases, meaning  that the top 20% of customers  generate  80% of sales, and solving  the core 20%
of problems  tend to solve 80% of all problems.
Strategies  and Pareto’s  rule are very well matched.  As shown in the figure below, it can be understood  that if
resources  are concentrated  on solving  the causal variable  that is the essence  of the problem,  more than 80%
of the problem  can be solved as a result.
E) Rational  decision-making  techniques
Rational  thinking  is a technique  for making  the most efficient  and effective  decisions,  although  it cannot  accu-
rately verify truth/falsehood.  In other words, it can be said that it is a thinking  technique  for decision-making
that best suits the purpose among many alternatives.  There are the following  techniques  for making  this ra-
tional decision.
@ Multi-Criteria  Decision  Making(MADM)
The Multi-Criteria  Decision  Making is a technique  that considers  the criteria of various  factors rather  than one
criterion  in the process  of selecting  the best alternative.  The factors to be considered  refer to the attributes
that are characteristic  of the object, and the degree to which each factor meets the purpose  is evaluated  and
reflected  in the final decision-making.
@ Analytic  Hierarchy  Process  (AHP)
The AHP technique  is a technique  that leads to the final decision  by arranging  the information  of the situation
in hierarchical  tree for decision-making  and analyzing  it in stages. This technique  proceeds  by segmenting
complex  and non-quantifiable  problems  for easier analysis  and evaluating  the segmented  problems  through
pairwise comparisons.  Through  segmentation,  the problem is divided into a more understandable  form, and
decision  makers  can easily compare  and judge the elements  of each class.
F) Problem-solving  skills
Recently,  companies  are emphasizing  problem-solving  skills as a common  competency.  Problem  awareness
is necessary  to solve real problems.  In simple terms, problem-solving  can be described  as “an activity  that
recognizes  the gap between  the desired level and the current  level and improves  it’. In other words, since it is
difficult  to solve practical  problems  if you are complacent  with the current level or simply follow the existing
method,  efforts to continuously  raise the desired  level (quality  threshold) through  various  information collec-
tion and experiences  are required.  There are three main factors  that increase  the level of problem  solving.
@ Always  ask “why”
Above all, trying to recognize  the problem by questing  “why” is the essence  of problem-  solving. Of course, if
you do not recognize  the problem itself, you cannot solve the problem,  so you must always have a sense of
