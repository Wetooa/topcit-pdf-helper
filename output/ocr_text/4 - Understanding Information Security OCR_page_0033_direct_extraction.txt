[Figure 12] Server  file integrity  check
However, a security  incident  that has occurred  between  the check period cannot be detected  by checking
integrity  periodically.  The shorter  the integrity  check period, the better. However,  if the number  of files
increases,  creating and comparing  hash values for each file increases  the server load. Therefore,  it’s not an
effective  method.
Introducing  an integrity  check technique  that can detect an error at the kernel level in real time, is an
alternative  to the periodic  integrity  check method.  That is, it is more effective  to only run an integrity  check
once and check file alteration  in real time whenever  the file is executed  or loaded into the memory  to check
whether  the file has been tampered.  In this way, loading the tampered  executable  file into memory  can be
prevented  without  constantly  causing  a CPU load.
+ Integrity  during transmission
The integrity  of the message  transmitted  over the network  is also an important  security  issue. A hacker
can intercept  and alter the transmitted  message  as shown in [Figure 13]. To check the integrity  of the
transmitted  message,  the sender creates a hash value for the message  and transmits  it along with the
message.  Upon receipt of the message,  the receiver  checks the integrity  of the message  and, if tampered,
ignores  the message.
The hash function  can be used in the form of a message  authentication  code (MAC), if authenticating
the identity  of the sender is not needed, and only the integrity  of the data that has not been tampered
during transmission  is needed.  When the sender calculates  the hash value using the message  as an input,
it becomes  a message  authentication  code. If this message  authentication  code is sent together  with the
message,  the receiver  can be confident  that the message  has not been tampered  during transmission.
