Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Practical  preview
Company  A is an online retailer Until recently,  it competed  for the No. 1 or 2 position  in the domestic
market, but has experienced  declining  sales, due to the influence  of cheap imports  from China entering
the domestic  online market.  Therefore,  the company  needs a new competitive  edge. Firstly, it wants to
establish  a new marketing  strategy  by collecting and analyzing  customer  data. It intends to expand the
infrastructure  in order to collect big data beyond the existing  database  and to hire analysts  from outside
to analyze  the collected  data. This case shows why enterprises  seek to find ways to collect, store, analyze,
and utilize big data. This chapter  describes  the big data system  in more detail.
01 Bid Data System  Structure
A) Hadoop  ecosystem
Understanding  the big data system structure  begins with understanding  the Hadoop ecosystem.  Hadoop,  the
abbreviation  of High-availability  distributed  object-oriented  platform,  refers to a Java-based  framework  for the
distributed  processing  of a large volume  of data in multiple  distributed  storage.  It is an initial solution  and consists  of
the Hadoop  distributed  file system (HDFS) and Map Reduce.  However,  these two modules  are based on open source,
and it was difficult  for non-specialists  to utilize big data. The modules  are packaged  with various peripheral  modules,
as shown in [Figure 100], to solve the problem.  These peripheral  modules  support  data integration  and migration,
application  management,  and system  management,  and they have been developed  as part of the Hadoop  project.
