Overview  of System Architecture )
SIP It is a core network  for providing  integrated  services  in wired/wireless  multiple  access  network  environments.
@IMS service  goals
IMS provides  multimedia  content,  such as voice, audio, video, and data, based on the IP protocol,  and it supports
quick service development  and change. It uses general-purpose  Internet-based  technology  to improve  the price
competitiveness  of services  and enable easy interface  with various 3rd party applications,  based on an efficient
session  management  function  and expansion  of business  areas, through  global linking between  services.
© IMS network  structure
The logical structure  of an all-IP network  is divided into a radio network  domain,  a GPRS-based  packet-switching
service domain, and an IP multimedia  service domain.  The GPRS-based  packet-switching  service domain can be
replaced  with an IP network  by a packet router outside the 3GPP scope. The wireless  domain can be replaced  with
other wireless  network  access domains  and data network  access domains,  as Wibro and mobile-LAN  that are out
of the 3GPP scope. The IMS service domain consists  of the call session control function  (CSCF) that registers  and
processes  multimedia  calls using the IETF’s SIP protocol  and the home subscriber  server (HSS) that integrates  the
home location register  (HLR) function  of the legacy  mobile network  with the function  to mobility  management  and
authentication  of IP multimedia  users.
@ MS's role in the convergence  aspect
+ ID and authentication  system  in the convergence  environment,  using the IMS infrastructure
+ Bidirectional  channel  for service  control
+ Service  session  connection,  through  the independent  service infrastructure
