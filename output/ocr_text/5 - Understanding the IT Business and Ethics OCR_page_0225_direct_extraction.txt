@ Ethical Issues of Big Data
In the era of the 4th industrial  revolution,  data is a technology  that has created  profits and technology  benefits  by
creating  information  for products  and services  as the core of industrial  growth. However,  when big data loses its
ethical neutrality,  it can create harmful data. Therefore,  big data must be operated  in an ethical manner  throughout
the entire process of the processing  and management  system, such as collection  and management,  use, and
disposal.
The ethical issues related  to big data include  the following:
+ Ethical operation  and prevention  of abuse of big data management  system
+ Data access control at the collection  stage, safe storage  and management  of data, anonymization/encryption  data
processing,  prevention  of generating  information  that infringes  privacy,  safe data destruction
+ Restrictions  on the creation  of big data of sensitive  information  such as ideologies,  beliefs and political  opinions  of
specific  individuals
+ Prohibit use of analyzed  information  for purposes  other than the intended  purpose, prevent  unauthorized  use of
analyzed  information
+ Prevention  of misuse  and leakage  of personal  information
* Operation  of policies  on ownership  and rights of big data
+ Regulation  on creators  and users of big data
* Consider  the matter of simply using big data for commercial  purposes  (resolving  health inequality,  strengthening
public medical  systems,  avoiding  the use of simple big data for commercial  purposes,  not for academic  research,  etc.)
Cloudera,  Inc. recently  announced  the evolution  of big data technology  and the ethical use of data, with the following
four key principles  to ensure that data is not abused.
1) Adjustment  of expectations  between  organizations  and individuals  on how data are used
2) Establishing  best practices  for data management
3) Setting  boundaries
4) Supervision  and regulation  can be led by the government  or industry,  and by itself,
As a guideline  for dealing  with personal  information  in big data, there is “Guidelines  for De-identification  of Personal
