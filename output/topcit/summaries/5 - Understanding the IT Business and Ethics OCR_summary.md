    *   Set clear goals and define the scope for IT initiatives.
    *   Establish an IT business plan that strategically links IT with overall business objectives.
*   **Do (D):**
    *   Design and implement the IT business solution or project.
    *   Collect operational data generated by the implemented IT solution.
*   **Check (C):**
    *   Analyze the results and outcomes of the IT business operations.
    *   Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for both business and IT.
    *   Verify the correlation and impact of IT performance on business results.
*   **Action (A):**
    *   Identify necessary improvements or adjustments based on the analysis from the "Check" phase.
    *   Modify the IT solution or processes to better support the business.
    *   The cycle then repeats, returning to the "Planning" phase for continuous refinement and renewal.

### **2.1 IT Business Management and Control Structure**

*   **Purpose:** To ensure IT services and infrastructure effectively support business processes to achieve desired IT business outcomes.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **IT Service & Infrastructure Support:** Provide operational support.
    2.  **Business Process:** The core activities that utilize IT.
    3.  **Performance Metrics:**
        *   **IT Service Quality (IT QoS):** Measures the quality of IT operational support.
        *   **Business Performance Results:** Measures the overall performance of the organization.
        *   These combine to form **IT-business performance metrics**.
    4.  **IT Business Management:** Analyzes these metrics and IT QoS to make informed decisions, adjustments, and investments in IT service and infrastructure, ensuring target performance levels are met.

## **3. The IT Business Value Chain**

The value chain model is a critical management theory for analyzing business activities and understanding a company's competitive advantage. It breaks down an enterprise into **key (primary) activities** and **support activities**.

### **3.1 Traditional vs. E-commerce Value Chains**

The structure of the value chain differs significantly based on the business model:

*   **Traditional Manufacturing Company Value Chain:**
    *   **Key Activities:** Warehousing, operation (production), shipment, marketing & sales, customer service.
    *   **Support Activities:** Corporate infrastructure, HR management, technology development, purchasing activities.
*   **E-commerce Company Value Chain:** (Focused on digital and electronic processes for efficiency)
    *   **Key Activities:** Procurement, zero-inventory production, third-party logistics, network sales, online services.
    *   **Support Activities:** Integrated information platform and network infrastructure, Internet recruitment, online management of suppliers.

### **3.2 The Evolving Role of IT in the Value Chain**

The perception of IT's role in the value chain has changed dramatically:

*   **Past View (Pre-mid-2000s):** IT was largely considered a "back-office support activity," separate from a company's main operations.
*   **Current View (Post-2000s, especially Post-2010):**
    *   **Company-Wide IT Integration:** IT is now integrated into *all* key and support activities across the entire company. It is a critical factor in every aspect of primary operations.
        *   **Example:** A hypermarket cannot operate competitively without IT to manage inventory, display products, and collect customer data in real-time. This highlights a fundamental **convergence** of the value chain model with IT.
    *   **IT-Specialized Companies:** For businesses whose core model is e-business or Internet-based (e.g., Amazon.com, Interpark), IT is inseparable from both their key and support activities. Their entire value chain is inherently IT-driven.
    *   **Expansion of the Value Chain Model:** This pervasive integration means our understanding of the traditional value chain must expand.
        *   IT integration drives significant **structural changes** within organizations (e.g., eliminating unnecessary decision-making steps via intranet systems, fostering more horizontal organizations by distributing information widely).
        *   The utilization of IT is now seen as having a decisive impact on an entire organization's structure and competitive advantages, representing a **new concept of the value chain model**.

## **4. Recent Trends & Major Issues: IT Business Strategy**

Developing an effective IT business strategy is crucial for companies to achieve their missions and objectives within complex internal and external environments.

*   **Strategic Importance:** Setting the right strategy is particularly critical for the modern IT business, which involves deep integration of IT with business processes.
*   **Key Areas of Focus:** As the domain of IT business expands, there is growing interest in:
    *   Methods for establishing robust IT business strategies.
    *   Techniques for analyzing the business environment (e.g., **SWOT analysis**) as a prerequisite for strategy formulation.
*   **Future Learning:** This topic involves exploring current and future models for IT business strategies, implementation methods, and various environmental analysis tools.

## **IT Business & Ethics: Strategy & Value Chain**

### **1. IT's Evolving Role in the Business Value Chain**

The traditional Value Chain Model, which outlines a company's key and support activities, is fundamentally transformed by IT.

*   **Company-wide IT Integration:**
    *   IT is no longer just for "back-office" functions.
    *   It's integrated into *all* key and support activities of a company's value chain.
    *   **Example:** A hypermarket uses IT for real-time inventory, customer behavior analysis, and purchase history tracking to stay competitive.
*   **IT-Specialized Companies:**
    *   For e-businesses or Internet businesses (e.g., Amazon.com, Interpark), IT is the core.
    *   Their key and support activities are inseparable from IT; a new perspective on the value chain is needed.
*   **Expansion of the Value Chain Model:**
    *   Our understanding of the value chain must adapt to IT's dual role:
        1.  IT integrated *into* existing business processes.
        2.  IT *as* the main business itself.
    *   **Impact of IT Integration:**
        *   Drives structural changes within companies.
        *   Eliminates unnecessary processes (e.g., through intranet information systems).
        *   Transforms hierarchical organizations into more horizontal ones by sharing information more broadly.
        *   IT's impact creates a "new" value chain concept that influences organizational structure and competitive advantage.

### **2. IT Business Strategy: Introduction**

**IT Business Strategy** is about finding the most effective way to achieve a company's mission and objectives by integrating IT and business processes, considering both internal and external environments.

*   **Key Focus:** Establishing strategies and analyzing the environment before formulation.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Explain IT business strategy.
    2.  Explain business environment analysis models for IT strategy formulation.
*   **Keywords:** IT business strategy formulation, IT business environment analysis.

### **3. Practical Example: Dell Computers' SWOT Analysis (Mid-1990s)**

Dell used **SWOT analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to develop its IT business strategy.

*   **Strengths (Internal):**
    *   Ability to sell directly to consumers.
    *   Ability to design components to lower manufacturing costs.
    *   Lower prices than competitors.
*   **Weaknesses (Internal):**

    *   Competitors had strong relationships with local dealerships.
*   **Dell's Strategy based on SWOT:**
    *   **Leveraged Strengths & Opportunities:** Assembled and sold custom-built computers directly to customers (initially phone, then Internet).
    *   **Addressed Weaknesses & Threats:** Eliminated dependence on local dealer networks, directly counteracting competitor advantages in that area. Built high-quality, tailored PCs shipped immediately, neutralizing brand/quality threats.

### **4. Phases of IT Business Strategy**

Developing an IT business strategy involves two main phases:

**Phase 1: Establishment of IT Business Strategy**
*   Defining the strategy's general concept, elements, and process.

**Phase 2: Analysis of the IT Business Environment**
*   Involves analyzing external, internal, and then consolidated environments.

### 4. Comparison of ISP and EA Concepts

| Category       | ISP (Information Strategic Planning)                                                               | EA (Enterprise Architecture)                                                                                    |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objectives** | Link management strategy with informatization strategy; introduce new IT.                      | Blueprint for seamless integration of business and information resources.                                        |
| **Scope**      | Informatization strategy; can be company-wide, service, or departmental.                         | Architectures for technology (ITA), business (BA), application (AA), data (DA), etc., company-wide.             |
| **Main Activities** | - Analysis of business management environment, IT trends, tasks, IT system structure. <br> - Establishment of IT strategy & management system. <br> - Design future task handling process & IT system. <br> - Establish To-Be roadmap. | - Establish ITA direction & guidelines, reference models (BRM, SRM, DRM, TRM/SP, PRM). <br> - Analyze AS-IS architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Establish TO-BE architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Establish implementation plan & ITA management system. |
| **Key Outputs** | - Reports on analysis (business environment, IT trends, job/IT system). <br> - IT vision & strategy. <br> - Implementation agenda & roadmap. | - Company-wide architecture vision, rules, architecture matrix. <br> - Current & target architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Plan for target architecture implementation. |

**Key Relationship:**
*   ISP deals with plans that fall within the scope of EA but are **more microscopic** and focused on the **informatization strategy**.
*   EA is deployed under a company's target architecture, aligning IT direction with management strategy using the latest IT.

**EA Management:**
*   EA must be managed to **respond quickly to changes** in the business management environment.
*   It needs to be **flexible** for quick implementation of company agendas through continuous updating.
*   The EA roadmap must be **shared** across the organization.

Understanding how IT initiatives are planned and integrated within an organization.

#### **1.1 Information Strategy Planning (ISP)**

*   **Purpose:** To link a company's management strategy with its information technology (IT) strategy and introduce new IT solutions. It's about planning *how* to use IT to achieve business goals.
*   **Scope:** Can be applied company-wide, to a specific service, or a department. It is more focused and "microscopic" compared to EA, concentrating on the IT informatization strategy itself.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Analyzing the business management environment (organization, stakeholders, customers).
    *   Analyzing the latest IT trends.
    *   Analyzing current business tasks and processes.
    *   Analyzing the existing information system structure.
    *   Establishing the new IT strategy and an information management system.
    *   Designing future business processes and information systems (the "To-Be" state).
    *   Creating a "To-Be" roadmap for implementation.
*   **Key Outputs:**
    *   Reports on business environment and IT trend analysis.
    *   Reports on job/information system analysis.
    *   Defined IT vision and strategy.
    *   An implementation agenda and roadmap.

#### **1.2 Enterprise Architecture (EA)**

*   **Purpose:** To create a blueprint for seamless integration of all business and information resources. It aligns IT direction with the overall management strategy.
*   **Scope:** Broader and more "macro-level" than ISP. It covers various architectures across the enterprise:
    *   **BA (Business Architecture):** How the business operates.
    *   **AA (Application Architecture):** How applications support business processes.
    *   **DA (Data Architecture):** How data is structured and managed.
    *   **TA (Technology Architecture):** The underlying technology infrastructure.
    *   **SA (Security Architecture):** How systems are secured.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Establishing direction and guidelines for IT Architecture (ITA).
    *   Establishing reference models (e.g., Business, Service, Data, Technical, Performance Reference Models).
    *   Analyzing the current ("AS-IS") architecture across all domains (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA).
    *   Establishing the target ("TO-BE") architecture for all domains.
    *   Developing an implementation plan.
    *   Establishing an ITA management system.
*   **Key Outputs:**
    *   Company-wide architecture vision, rules, and architecture matrix.
    *   Documentation of the current and target architectures (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA).
    *   A plan for implementing the target architecture.
*   **Key Characteristic:** EA must be flexible and continuously updated to respond quickly to changes in the business environment, ensuring the company's agenda is quickly implemented and shared.

#### **1.3 ISP vs. EA: Summary**

| Category    | Information Strategy Planning (ISP)                               | Enterprise Architecture (EA)                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective** | Links management & IT strategy; introduces new IT.                | Blueprint for business & IT resource integration; aligns IT with management strategy.           |
| **Scope**   | More focused on *informatization strategy*; microscopic within EA. | Broader target architecture (Business, Application, Data, Technology, Security); company-wide. |
| **Focus**   | Planning *how* IT will support goals.                            | Defining *what* the overall IT and business structure should look like.                       |

### **3. Recent Trends & Issues: The Split Order Process**

*   **Problem Context (Public Sector Example):** Historically, poor planning and design of information systems (especially in the public sector) led to excessive work changes, cost overruns, and a lack of awareness/expertise regarding IT system benefits.
*   **Regulatory Measures:** Legislation now requires detailed **RFP (Request for Proposal)** and a **PMO (Project Management Office)** program for IT business deployment to improve outcomes.
*   **The "Split Order Process":** A government initiative to prevent irresponsible work changes and unfair subcontracting structures.
    *   **Core Idea:** Separates the **planning/design** phase from the **deployment/development** phase.
    *   **Planning/Design Phase:** Focuses on detailed requirement analysis, including:
        *   **ISP (Information Strategy Plan)**
        *   **ISMP (Information System Master Plan)**
        *   **Basic Design (Logical Design)**
    *   **Deployment/Development Phase:** Involves:
        *   **Detailed Design (Physical Design)**
        *   **System Development (Coding)**
        *   **Testing**
*   **Significance:**
    *   Promotes more meticulous and systematic planning and design.
    *   Helps overcome the "invisibility of software" by making requirements clearer upfront.
    *   Highlights how frequent requirement changes impede IT business success, encouraging upfront clarity.

### **4. IT Business Adoption Process**

The method by which a company acquires or develops IT systems or services.

*   **Alignment:** IT business adoption must align with the company's overall IT strategy and plans.
*   **Customization:** The methods and procedures should be tailored to the organization's size and its external environment.
*   **Core of IT:** Since the core value of IT is often implemented in software, the success of software development is critical for successful IT business adoption.
*   **Standardization:** The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, specifically following standards like **ISO/IEC 12207**, should be used for software development post-adoption.

#### **4.1 IT Business Ordering Process**

This process defines the steps for the "orderer" (the department/person needing the IT solution) and involves external "suppliers" or internal "developers."

*   **Orderer:** The department or person responsible for defining and issuing requirements.
*   **Developer/Supplier:** The company's internal IT department or an external IT outsourcing expert.
*   **Key Activities within the Ordering Process:**
    1.  **Concept Definition & Detailed Specification of Requirements:** Clearly outlining what is needed.
    2.  **Preparation of RFP (Request for Proposal):** Document inviting potential suppliers to propose solutions.
    3.  **Evaluation of Proposal & Contract Signing:** Assessing proposals and formalizing the agreement.
    4.  **Monitoring of Project:** Overseeing the project's progress.
    5.  **Handover and Completion of Project:** Receiving the final solution and closing the project.

## Part 3: Understanding SCM (Supply Chain Management)

### 3.1 Concept of SCM
SCM refers to **Supply Chain Management solutions**.

**Supply Chain:** Encompasses the entire process from order placement, raw material supply, production, distribution network, to final delivery to the customer.

### 3.2 The Bullwhip Effect (The Biggest Problem in Supply Chains)
*   **Definition:** A phenomenon where a small change in end-consumer demand causes a sudden and significantly expanded demand upstream in the supply chain.
    *   **Example:** If a consumer orders 10 items, the retailer might order 12 "just in case," the wholesaler 15, and the manufacturer 20.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Overstocked supply chain.
    *   Wasted resources, unnecessary investments in manpower and facilities.
    *   Distorted demand and increased variance at each step upstream.
    *   High risks for raw material suppliers.
    *   Inefficiency across the entire supply chain due to demand imbalance.
    *   Results in surplus orders, excess inventory, and overinvestment.

### 3.3 Goal and How SCM Works
**Goal of SCM:** To maximize efficiency by rectifying the bullwhip effect and eliminating waste throughout the supply chain.

**How it Works:**
*   Supply chain players cooperate to manage materials, funds, and information.
*   It links and integrates the flow of all goods, services, and values (purchasing, manufacture, allocation, distribution) from suppliers to end customers.

**Effects of SCM:**
*   Shortened lead time.
*   Reduced uncertainties and variabilities.

**Overall:** SCM is a management technique focused on optimizing inventory management and other supply chain decisions.

## IT Business and Ethics: ERP, SCM, and CRM Learning Guide

This guide covers ERP Deployment Strategies, Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

---

### **1. ERP Deployment Strategy**

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems can be deployed using three main approaches:

**A. Deployment Approaches**

1.  **Big Bang Method:**
    *   **Description:** All ERP modules and functions are deployed simultaneously across the entire enterprise.
    *   **Strengths:** Easy integration of the package itself, simpler project management for integration.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Large-scale projects, difficult overall project management.
2.  **Phased and Function-Based Approach (Functional Approach):**
    *   **Description:** ERP modules are deployed in phases, separated by their functions (e.g., finance module first, then HR).
    *   **Strengths:** Less resistance to change within the business due to gradual deployment.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Requires additional programs to link with existing systems during phased rollout.
3.  **Phased and Place of Business Approach (Place of Business Approach):**
    *   **Description:** ERP is deployed in phases at individual business locations (e.g., one branch first, then others). Deployment expands horizontally once stable.
    *   **Strengths:** Efficient use of human resources as they can be recycled across phases.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Risk of project prolongation and redundant work.

**B. ERP Solutions**

*   **Vendors:** Both domestic (e.g., Younglimwon ERP, Douzone ERP) and foreign global vendors (e.g., SAP ERP, Oracle ERP) offer solutions. In-house development is also possible.
*   **Commercial Products:** Offer advantages of standardized processes, but customization to specific enterprise environments can be difficult.
*   **Key Consideration:** When adopting, check for compliance with **IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)**, which are global accounting standards.

---

### **2. Understanding Supply Chain Management (SCM)**

**A. Concept of SCM**

*   **Supply Chain:** The entire process from order placement, raw material supply, production, distribution, to final customer delivery.
*   **The Bullwhip Effect:**
    *   **Problem:** A phenomenon where small changes in end-consumer demand lead to dramatically increasing demand fluctuations further up the supply chain (e.g., small consumer order leads to larger orders from retailer to wholesaler, then to manufacturer, then to parts suppliers).
    *   **Impact:** Distorted demand, increased variance at each step, huge risks for upstream suppliers, inefficiency, surplus orders, excess inventory, and overinvestment.
*   **SCM Goal:** To maximize efficiency by rectifying the bullwhip effect and eliminating waste throughout the supply chain.
*   **SCM Mechanism:** Players in the supply chain cooperate, managing materials, funds, and information to link and integrate all goods, services, and value flows (purchasing, manufacture, allocation, distribution) from suppliers to end customers.
*   **Benefits:** Shortened lead times, reduced uncertainties and variabilities, optimized inventory.

**B. Functions of SCM**

SCM has three core functions that form a positive feedback cycle for continuous improvement:

1.  **Supply Chain Planning (SCP):**
    *   **Description:** Establishes optimal plans for daily supply chain operations.
    *   **Examples:** Demand forecasting, global production plans, transportation/delivery plans, distribution allocation plans.
2.  **Supply Chain Execution (SCE):**
    *   **Description:** Enhances efficiency of field logistics.
    *   **Examples:** Warehousing, product transport/delivery management, order management, distribution management. Uses digital tools like barcodes and RFID.
3.  **Supply Chain Visibility:**
    *   **Description:** Monitors the supply chain, identifies costs and performance, looks for anomalies, and provides preventive functions by recommending corrective actions.

**C. SCM vs. ERP Comparison**

| Category            | SCM                                        | ERP                                                              |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |

    *   Enterprises need customer-centric structures, diverse customer interface channels, and customer management strategies that lead to better earnings.
*   **Implementation:** Requires analyzing customer behavior and consumption patterns, consolidating internal/external data, and deriving insights (e.g., using Big Data analysis).

**B. Customer Life Cycle and CRM Goal**

Enterprises manage customers through their entire life cycle:

*   **Acquisition:** Target responsive potential customers with focused marketing.
*   **Retention/Growth:** Strategically manage purchasing and high-value (loyal) customers. Categorize customers by personality, type, and interests to provide tailored services and marketing.
*   **CRM Goal:** To maximize **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – the total value a customer generates throughout their relationship with the enterprise, rather than just temporary profits from individual transactions.

**C. Official Definition of CRM (Gartner)**

*   "A strategy for optimizing corporate sales and expanding the customer base by creating and supporting relationships with profitable customers."
*   **Essentially:** It's a management technique that integrates and analyzes customer-related data (internal and external) to provide findings to customer points of contact, enabling continuous delivery of desired products/services based on accurate customer understanding, ultimately maximizing CLV and profitability.

**D. CRM Classification**

From a process perspective, CRM collects, analyzes, and provides meaningful information. It can be classified into three types:

1.  **Analysis CRM:**
    *   **Description:** Gathers information from customer interactions, derives meaningful insights, and supplies them to the enterprise.
2.  **Operations CRM:**
    *   **Description:** Uses the insights from Analysis CRM as the backbone for marketing, servicing, and sales activities.
3.  **Collaboration CRM:**
    *   **Description:** Focuses on enterprise interactions with customers through a diverse range of communication channels.

    *   **Use:** Assesses investment feasibility.
    *   **Limitation:** Cannot estimate the time an investment needs to yield net income.

*   **Net Present Value (NPV)**
    *   **Definition:** Expresses the relationship between the cost and effect of a currency's present value, considering its discount rate.
    *   **Reflects:** Accurate future net profits and monetary value over time.
    *   **Note:** Risks associated with the payback period must be considered separately.

*   **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
    *   **Definition:** Revenues generated from investments against cash flows.
    *   **Expresses:** Expected annual revenues to judge risk reduction.
    *   **Limitation:** Does not consider investment size or payback period.

*   **Payback Period (PP)**
    *   **Definition:** The time it takes for cumulative effect to exceed cumulative cost and reach the break-even point.
    *   **Expresses:** Point of transition to surplus or visible success.
    *   **Shows:** *When* revenue is generated, but not *how much*.

*   **Balance between indicators:**
    *   Approaches performance from multiple perspectives (not just financial).
    *   Balances short-term and long-term views.
    *   Balances leading (predictive) and trailing (result-oriented) indicators.
*   **Concreteness of strategy:**
    *   Secures strategy clarity through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    *   Aims for company-wide optimization, not just partial.
    *   Aligns strategies with correct business directions.
*   **Connectivity of strategy:**
    *   Establishes causal relationships between strategies.
    *   Links core strategies after focused selection.
*   **Internal communication tool:**
    *   Builds executive capability using detailed KPIs.
    *   Serves as a common language across the organization.

#### C) Component Elements of BSC

BSC evaluates performance from four perspectives and includes elements to manage and achieve enterprise goals.

*   **Perspective:** The four viewpoints from which performance is evaluated (Finance, Customer, Process, Learning & Growth).
*   **Critical Success Factor (CSF):** Factors essential for successfully realizing the enterprise's vision and strategy.
*   **Strategy Map:** A visual representation showing the causal relationships among CSFs, illustrating how an organization creates value.
*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** An indicator to measure and manage the level and success of a CSF.

# Personal Information Protection: A Learning Guide

## 1. Introduction to Personal Information Security

### 1.1 Why Personal Information Protection Matters
Recent incidents highlight the critical need for personal information protection. Hackers have leaked millions of individuals' data, including:
*   Website IDs, names, dates of birth, emails, phone numbers, addresses, passport numbers.
*   Accommodation reservations and member information.

These breaches lead to severe penalties, such as large fines and corrective orders, for companies violating personal information protection laws like the **Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection, Etc. (Network Act)**. Violations include failures in access control, record preservation, encryption, and data expiration.

## 2. Understanding Personal Information

*   **"Easily combined with other information"** means there's a high and possible chance of obtaining and combining additional information to identify someone.

### 2.2 Types of Personal Information
Personal information encompasses various categories:

*   **Identification:** Name, ID numbers, address, phone, email, date/place of birth, family details.
*   **Physical:** Biometrics (face, fingerprint, iris, voice, genetic info), height, weight. Medical/Health status, records, disabilities.
*   **Mental:** Preferences (rental/purchase history, website searches), inner secrets (thoughts, beliefs, religion, values, political views).
*   **Property:** Real estate, savings, income, credit card numbers, bank accounts. Credit rating, loan/collateral details.
*   **Social:** Education (grades, attendance, certificates), legal (criminal record, trial record), labor (workplace, experience, job evaluations), military service.

When collecting or providing customer personal information, companies and public institutions must follow government guidelines for obtaining consent. Information should be presented clearly for users to understand.

#### 5.2.1 Preparation Stage for Policy Development

1.  **Identify Required Personal Information:**
    *   Determine the **minimum personal information** needed for a task.
    *   Check for **unique identification information** (resident registration, driver's license, passport, alien registration numbers) or **sensitive information** (ideology, beliefs, health, sex life, criminal history), as these require separate processing and consent.
2.  **Identify Retention Period:**
    *   Confirm the retention period via privacy policy guidelines or relevant laws.
    *   Set the minimum necessary retention period if not specified.
3.  **Confirm Consent Requirement for Collection & Use:**
    *   **Generally, consent from the information subject is required** for collection and use.
    *   **Exceptions (consent NOT needed for collection/use):**
        *   Public institutions performing statutory duties.
        *   Legal obligations or specific statutory provisions.
        *   Inevitably necessary for executing a contract with the data subject.
        *   Manifestly necessary to protect life, body, or property from imminent danger (and consent can't be obtained).
        *   Necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller, clearly superior to data subject's rights.
        *   For information and communication services, if difficult to get consent normally due to economic/technical reasons, or for service charge payment.

    *   **Children Under 14:** Consent of a legal representative is required.
4.  **Identify if Personal Information is Provided to a Third Party:**
    *   **Generally, separate consent is required** to provide personal information to a third party.
    *   **Checklist for Third-Party Provision (to be disclosed):**
        1.  Recipient of personal information.
        2.  Purpose of recipient's use.
        3.  Specific items of personal information provided.
        4.  Recipient's retention and use period.
        5.  The data subject's right to deny consent and any disadvantages.
    *   **Exception (consent NOT needed for third-party provision):** If provided within the scope of original collection purposes under certain legal conditions (similar to collection/use exceptions above).

### 4. De-identification Process of Personal Data

**De-identification:** Processing personal information with alternative methods (e.g., pseudonymization, aggregation, deletion, categorization, data masking) to remove elements that can identify an individual, making it impossible to link data to a specific person. This is crucial for businesses wanting to process information for data analysis.

#### 4.1 De-identification Standards

*   **Identifiers:**
    *   As a rule, identifiers in datasets should be deleted.
    *   If absolutely needed for data use, they must be de-identified.
*   **Attribute Values:**
    *   Remove attribute values irrelevant to data use.
    *   Strict de-identification for unique attributes (e.g., rare diseases, unique professional experiences) as they carry a high risk of re-identification.

#### 4.2 De-identification Process Flow
1.  **Personal Information:** Start with identifiable data.
2.  **De-identification:** Apply de-identification methods.
3.  **Evaluation:** Assess if the de-identification is adequate.
4.  **Adequacy Check:**
    *   **Yes (Adequate):** Information is deemed non-privacy, elements removed.
    *   **No (Inadequate):** Re-identify, re-process, or block if identification of a particular individual (or easy combination with other info) is still possible.

#### 4.3 Examples of Personal Information Identifiers

**A) Attribute Values (General Characteristics)**
*   **Personal:** Gender, age, nationality, hometown, city/county, zip code, military service, marital status, religion, hobbies, clubs, smoking, drinking, vegetarianism, concerns.
*   **Physical:** Blood type, height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, eye color, medical examination results, disability type/level.

#### 4.4 Methods of De-identification
Various methods can be used individually or combined. The choice depends on data usage purpose and method strengths/weaknesses.

**Examples of De-identification Methods:**
*   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing direct identifiers with artificial identifiers.
    *   **Example:** "Hong Gil-dong, 35, Seoul, Korea University" -> "Lim Kkeokjeong, 30s, Seoul, International University".
    *   **Technologies:** Heuristic pseudonymization, encryption, hashing, wrapping.
*   **Aggregation:** Combining data to prevent individual identification.
    *   **Example:** Individual heights (180cm, 170cm, 160cm, 150cm) -> "Sum of height among physics major students: 660cm, average height: 165cm."
    *   **Technologies:** K-anonymity, L-diversity, T-closeness, micro-aggregation, rounding.
*   **Data Reduction (Suppression/Deletion):** Removing or reducing parts of the data.
    *   **Example:** Resident registration number "901206-71234567" -> "90's born, male."

IPR encompasses all property rights arising from intellectual activities. It includes:
*   **Industrial Property Rights:** For industrial development (e.g., patents, trademarks).
*   **Copyrights:** For cultural development (e.g., literary, artistic works).

IPR are crucial corporate assets, with increasing transactions and new forms emerging due to technological advancements. Understanding them is vital in the IT business.

#### B. Key Concepts & Learning Objectives
*   **Keywords:** Intellectual property rights, copyrights, author's rights, industrial property rights, new intellectual property rights, business works, software copyrights, prevention of unfair competition, trade secret protection, patent rights.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Explain copyrights and copyright infringement prevention.
    2.  Explain intellectual property rights and industrial property rights.

#### C. Trade Secret Protection

**1. Importance and Risks:**
*   Leakage of trade secrets allows competitors to easily replicate products, engage in dumping, leading to business crises and intensified competition.

**2. Definition of a Trade Secret:**
*   According to the "Act on the Prevention of Unfair Competition and Protection of Trade Secrets," a **trade secret** is information (e.g., production methods, sales methods, useful technical or business information for business activities) that:
    *   Is not publicly known.
    *   Is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.
    *   Has independent economic value.

**3. Causes of Leaks:**
*   Surveys show that the majority of trade secret leaks are caused by **internal staff**, often during **employee turnover**.

**4. Legal Penalties for Trade Secret Violation:**
*   **Criminal Penalties:**
    *   Up to 5 years imprisonment for domestic cases.
    *   Up to 10 years imprisonment for overseas cases.
    *   Fines are also imposed along with imprisonment.
*   **Attempted/Conspiracy:** Even attempting, intending, or conspiring to commit a crime related to trade secrets is punishable.

**5. The Human Factor in Protection:**
*   Even with reinforced security technologies, trade secrets are frequently leaked by people. Therefore, comprehensive measures addressing human factors are essential.
*   A key reason for inadequate protection systems is that executives and employees often lack exact knowledge of the "Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act."

## 1. Copyright Registration Essentials

To register a copyright (or program copyright for software), you generally need:
*   **Application Statement:** Official form for copyright registration.
*   **Copies of the Work:**
    *   For general works: Drawings, photos, or electronic media.
    *   For computer programs: An electronic copy of the program.
    *   *Note:* A partial excerpt of program content may be submitted if it proves creation. This excerpt should be in program language before computer conversion.
*   **Proof of Registration Reason:** (Only if required)
*   **List of Stakeholders:** If there are multiple authors, heirs, rights holders, etc., provide a list.
*   **List of Works:** For large-quantity registrations (multiple works, neighboring works, databases).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *   **Patent:** Right to an invention (e.g., manufacturing method). Duration: 20 years from application date. Not applicable if publicly known/used before filing.
*   **Trademark:** Right to a mark identifying one's goods/services.
    *   **Mark:** Symbols, letters, figures, sounds, smells, holograms, movements, or colors. Trade names can also be registered.
    *   **Service Mark:** Trademark for services (e.g., academies). Website domains can be registered as service marks (a registered service mark takes precedence over a registered domain).
    *   Duration: Can be used virtually permanently by renewing every 10 years.
*   **Design:** Right to the aesthetic form, shape, color, or composition of an article or font. Duration: 20 years from registration date.
*   **Utility Model:** Right to protect practical designs, typically for improving the shape and structure of existing products to enhance practicality. Lower technical level than patents. Duration: 10 years from application date.

**Acquisition of IPR:**
*   Acquired by **registering with the Korean Intellectual Property Office**.
*   **First-to-file rule** applies.
*   Protection is **country-specific**: rights are recognized only in the country where registration is made; separate applications are needed in each country for international protection.
*   **Purpose:** Grant exclusive rights for a certain period to the creator, promoting technological and industrial development, after which anyone can use it.

**Violations of Industrial Property Rights:**
These involve misleading the public about the registration status of products or services.

*   **False Patent Claims:**
    *   Displaying an unregistered/non-existent patent number.
    *   Marking a product as patented when the application isn't complete.
    *   Using marks easily confused with patent marks.
    *   Marking a utility model, design, or trademark as a patent.
*   **False Trademark Claims:**
    *   Displaying an unregistered mark as if it were a registered or applied-for trademark.
    *   Using false trademarks in commercial materials (ads, signboards, packaging).
    *   Theft of renowned domestic and foreign trademarks.
*   **False Utility Model/Design Claims:**
    *   Marking an item as a utility model/design registration/application when it's not registered or pending.
    *   Displaying marks likely to be confused with registered utility models or designs.

**Punishment for False Display of IPR:**
*   Imprisonment for up to 3 years or a fine of up to 20 million won.
*   This is an **offense not subject to complaint**, meaning a third party (not just the victim) can file criminal charges.

## 4. Unfair Competition Prevention & Trade Secret Protection

### A) Unfair Competition Prevention

**Concept:** Aims to prevent unfair business practices, such as misusing well-known trademarks/trade names and infringing on trade secrets.

**Acts of Unfair Competition include:**

*   **Misusing Well-Known Marks:** Using identical or similar names, trade names, trademarks, or product packaging of another widely known person/company in Korea.
*   **False Origin/Quality Marks:** Making false claims about the origin, quality, content, manufacturing process, usage, or quantity of goods in advertising or on products.
*   **Agent/Representative Misuse of Trademarks:** Using a trademark registered in another country (by Paris Convention/WTO members) without good cause by an agent or former agent.
*   **Domain Name Squatting:** Registering, holding, transferring, or using a domain name identical or similar to another's well-known name/trademark without legitimate right, for purposes like selling it, preventing legitimate use, or gaining commercial profit.
*   **Copying Product Shapes:** Transferring, lending, exhibiting, importing, or exporting goods whose shape has been copied from another's manufactured goods.
*   **Misusing Business Ideas/Information:** Unfairly using another person's technical or business ideas (with economic value) obtained during negotiations (e.g., business proposals, auctions) for one's own or a third party's business interests, or providing such information to others to exploit.

### B) Trade Secret Protection

**Concept of a Trade Secret:** Information (like production methods, sales methods, technical/business information) that is:
1.  **Not publicly known:** The information is a secret.
2.  **Has independent economic value:** It's useful for business activities and has financial worth.
3.  **Managed as a secret:** Efforts have been made to keep it confidential (e.g., confidentiality notices, access restrictions, confidentiality agreements). *Information accessible to anyone is not a trade secret.*

**Acts Constituting Infringement of Trade Secrets:**

*   **Improper Acquisition & Use/Disclosure:** Acquiring trade secrets through theft, deception, coercion, or other improper means, then using or disclosing them.
*   **Knowledgeable Use/Disclosure:** Using or disclosing trade secrets after acquiring them, knowing they were improperly obtained, or without such knowledge due to gross negligence.
*   **Breach of Confidentiality:** Using or disclosing trade secrets to gain improper benefits or harm the owner while under a contractual or other duty to maintain secrecy.

**Precedents for Infringement of Trade Secrets:**
*   Adding only new features based on another's source code.
*   Developing and selling substantially similar programs by performing **reverse analysis** (reverse engineering) of program code, especially if it violates a contract or technical protection measures.

**Precedents that are NOT Infringement of Trade Secrets:**
*   When the programming language and implementation method of software are completely different.
*   Performing reverse analysis of legally purchased program code to obtain information necessary for compatibility, *when such information cannot be easily obtained otherwise* (Article 101-4 of Copyright Act).

## IT Business & Ethics: Learning Guide (Pages 217-221)

### 1. Unfair Competition & Intellectual Property

This section outlines various acts considered unfair competition, with a focus on trade secrets.

#### 1.1 Acts of Unfair Competition

Specific acts are defined as unfair competition, protecting various forms of intellectual property:

*   **Trademark Infringement by Agents/Representatives:**
    *   An agent/representative of a trademark owner (or someone who was within 1 year) uses an identical or similar trademark.
    *   The trademark must be registered in countries party to the Paris Convention, WTO, or Trademark Law Treaty.
    *   This includes selling, distributing, exporting, or importing goods with such a trademark.
*   **Domain Name Misuse (Cybersquatting):**
    *   Registering, holding, transferring, or using a domain name identical or similar to another person's name, trade name, or widely known trademark in South Korea.
    *   Done without a legitimate right and for specific purposes:
        *   Selling or lending the mark (e.g., trademark) to the legitimate owner or a third party.
        *   Preventing the legitimate owner from registering or using the domain name.
        *   Obtaining other commercial profits.
*   **Copying Product Shapes:**
    *   Transferring, lending, exhibiting, importing, or exporting goods whose shape has been copied from another person's manufactured goods.
*   **Unfair Use of Technical/Business Ideas:**
    *   Unfairly using information containing another person’s technical or business ideas with economic value.
    *   Information was obtained during negotiations or transactions (e.g., business proposal, auction, public offering).
    *   Used for personal or third-party business interests, violating the original purpose of the information's provision.
    *   Also includes providing such information to another person for their advantage.

#### 1.2 Trade Secrets

A crucial aspect of business protection.

*   **Concept of a Trade Secret:**
    *   Information (e.g., production methods, sales methods, technical/business info).
    *   **Requirements:**
        1.  **Non-publicity:** Not publicly known.
        2.  **Economic Usefulness:** Useful for business activities and has independent economic value.
        3.  **Confidentiality:** Managed as a secret through reasonable efforts (e.g., non-disclosure agreements, access restrictions). Information known to everyone is not a trade secret.

*   **Infringement of Trade Secrets:**
    *   **Acquisition & Use:** Acquiring trade secrets by theft, deception, coercion, or other improper means, then using or disclosing them.
    *   **Knowledge of Improper Acquisition:** Using or disclosing trade secrets after acquiring them, knowing (or being grossly negligent about the fact) that they were improperly obtained.
    *   **Breach of Duty:** Using or disclosing trade secrets for improper benefits or to harm the owner, while under a contractual or other duty to maintain secrecy.

*   **Legal Precedents for Trade Secret Infringement:**
    *   **Examples of Infringement:**
        *   Adding only new features based on existing (protected) source code.
        *   Developing, producing, and selling substantially similar programs by reverse engineering (violates Copyright Act Article 101-4).
        *   Reverse analysis conducted in violation of a contract, especially when technical protection measures were in place to prevent it.
    *   **Examples NOT Constituting Infringement:**
        *   Software developed with a completely different programming language and implementation method.
        *   Reverse analysis of a legally purchased program to obtain information necessary for compatibility, when that information cannot be easily obtained otherwise (Copyright Act Article 101-4).

### 2. Ethical Challenges in the IT Industry

The rapid advancement of IT brings new ethical considerations.

#### 2.1 Overview

*   **Trends:** The IT industry revolution fuels new products and services through technology convergence.
*   **Issues:** Despite improved technical competence, a lack of ethical awareness leads to increasing side effects like safety accidents, information leakage, and privacy invasion.
*   **Impact:** These issues hinder IT business development.
*   **Solution:** It's crucial to examine ethical issues in all service fields and cultivate strong ethical awareness to ensure sustainable IT development.

#### 2.2 Learning Objectives

A practical example of an ethical challenge in emerging technology.

*   **Scenario (The Trolley Problem applied to AI):**
    *   An autonomous car's brakes fail.
    *   Option 1: Drive straight, hit 5 pedestrians.
    *   Option 2: Swerve, hit 1 pedestrian.
    *   **Additional Complexity:** If the 1 person hit by swerving is an occupant of the car, who should the vehicle save?
*   **Survey Results (2016, Science journal):**
    *   **Public Opinion:** 78% of people said it's more ethical to save the most pedestrians.
    *   **Personal Choice Dilemma:** When asked if they would buy a car that prioritizes pedestrian safety over their own (as an occupant), most answered no.
*   **Core Challenge:** This highlights an inevitable ethical dilemma in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We must understand technology's benefits and potential problems from misuse to ensure safe use.

### 3. Major Ethical Issues in Latest IT Business Services

#### 3.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics

The rise of AI and intelligent robots has made AI ethics a central concern.

*   **Context:** Intelligent robots and AI-powered products/services are driving the 4th Industrial Revolution, creating an intelligent information society.
*   **Scope of AI Ethics:**
    *   **Moral & Philosophical Ethics:** Pertains to the identity of AI/robots and their relationship with humans.
    *   **Practical Ethics:** Required for professionals involved in developing and using AI that is distributed to consumers.

## Learning Guide: IT Business & Ethics - Focus on AI

### 1. Introduction: The Ethical Dilemma of Autonomous Technology

*   **Problem:** New technologies, like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), create complex ethical dilemmas.
*   **Example (Autonomous Vehicle):**
    *   **Scenario:** A self-driving car with broken brakes faces a choice:
        *   Hit 5 pedestrians (driving straight).
        *   Hit 1 pedestrian (turning).
        *   Hit 1 car occupant (turning, if the injured person isn't a pedestrian).
    *   **Survey Results (2016 Science Journal):**
        *   **Ethical Preference:** 78% of people said it's more ethical to save the most lives (5 pedestrians).
        *   **Purchase Intent:** However, most people *would not buy* an AV that prioritizes pedestrian safety over the car occupant's (who could be them or their family).
    *   **Conclusion:** This highlights a fundamental dilemma: what is rational/ethical for society vs. what is desired for personal safety.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Understanding the ethical issues of new technology is crucial for its safe and beneficial use, considering both its advantages and potential misuse.

### 2. Major Ethical Issues of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

*   **Context:** The rise of intelligent robots and products marks the 4th Industrial Revolution and an intelligent information society.
*   **Two Main Types of AI Ethical Issues:**
    1.  **Moral & Philosophical Ethics:** Pertains to the identity of AI/robots and their relationship with humans.
    2.  **Practical Ethics:** Required from professionals (developers, users) involved in creating and distributing AI.

#### Key International AI Ethics Initiatives & Principles:

Several organizations have issued guidelines for AI ethics:

*   **2010 - UK EPSRC (Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council):** Presented "Principles of Robots," covering AI issues from the perspective of designers, builders, and users.
*   **2016 (Oct) - US NSTC (National Science and Technology Commission):** Published "Preparing for the future of artificial intelligence." Emphasized:
    *   AI as an economic growth engine.
    *   Need for national/social consensus on future AI issues.
*   **2016 (Dec) - IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** Announced "Ethically Aligned Design." Focused on:
    *   Designing AI with ethical aspects from the start.
    *   Accountability of suppliers, transparency, awareness, privacy, employment.
*   **2016 (Dec) - Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications:** Proposed "Discussion toward Formulation of AI R&D Guideline." Presented eight principles for AI developers: transparency, user support, controllability, security, safety, personal info protection, ethics, accountability.
*   **2017 (Jan) - US FLI (Future of Life Institute):** Announced "Asilomar AI Principles."
    *   23 principles for AI development, signed by over 2,000 experts.
    *   Keywords: safety, transparency, accountability, privacy protection, shared profits, avoiding AI arms race.
*   **2017 (Feb) - EU (European Union):** Released "Civil Law Rules on Robotics." Advised developers, researchers, and designers to prioritize:
    *   Human dignity, personal privacy, and human safety when planning, designing, and implementing robots.

#### Ethical Guidelines for AI Developers:

*   **Reason for Specific Guidelines:** AI's performance is affected by human interaction, its behavior is difficult to predict, and it's more complex/less secure than conventional software.
*   **Developer Responsibilities:**
    1.  Design & develop AI accurately, clearly, fairly, and faithfully to client orders.
    2.  Conduct quality certification and supply AI to business operators.
    3.  Maintain product responsibility and provide continuous upgrades.
    4.  Prepare and provide malfunction countermeasures within the product.
    5.  Comply with global standard design/implementation and share knowledge.
    6.  Act honestly and unbiasedly with customers, obey laws (societal, national, global), and respect intellectual property (universal social responsibility).

### 3. Foundational AI Ethics: Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

*   **Origin:** Introduced by Isaac Asimov in his 1942 short story "Runaround" and formalized in the 1950 collection "I, Robot."
*   **Purpose:** These are "commands" embedded *within* an AI robot at manufacturing, forming a "moral code" for the AI itself, not ethical rules for developers. They regulate robot behavior and define their relationship with humans.
*   **The Three Laws (in order of precedence):**
    1.  **First Law:** A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
    2.  **Second Law:** A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
    3.  **Third Law:** A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
*   **Later Addition (1984):** A "Zeroth Law" was later implied/added: "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm." (This supersedes all three original laws).

### 4. Advanced AI Ethics: The Asilomar AI Principles

*   **Origin:** Published by the Future of Life Institute (FLI) in the U.S.
*   **Structure:** Divided into three main categories:

### 2. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

These foundational principles, introduced by Isaac Asimov, are **moral codes embedded within AI robots at the manufacturing stage**, not ethics for AI developers. They dictate a robot's behavior:

*   **First Law:** A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
*   **Second Law:** A robot must obey orders given by humans, *unless* those orders conflict with the First Law. (First Law takes precedence).
*   **Third Law:** A robot must protect its own existence, *unless* such protection conflicts with the First or Second Law. (First and Second Laws take precedence).

**Later Addition (1984):** "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm." (Often referred to as the "Zeroth Law," preceding the others).

### 3. The Asilomar AI Principles (by Future of Life Institute - FLI)

These principles are divided into three categories:

#### A. Research Issues
1.  **Research Goal:** Create *beneficial* intelligence, not just undirected intelligence.

1.  **Safety:** AI systems must be safe and secure throughout their operational life, verifiably so.
2.  **Failure Transparency:** If an AI causes harm, it must be possible to ascertain why.
3.  **Judicial Transparency:** Autonomous systems in judicial decisions need auditable explanations for humans.
4.  **Responsibility:** Designers/builders of advanced AI are responsible for its moral implications (use, misuse, actions).
5.  **Value Alignment:** Highly autonomous AI must be designed so its goals and behaviors align with human values.
6.  **Human Values:** AI systems should be compatible with human dignity, rights, freedoms, and cultural diversity.
7.  **Personal Privacy:** People should control the data they generate, especially given AI's analytical power.
8.  **Liberty and Privacy:** AI use of personal data must not unreasonably restrict people's liberty.
9.  **Shared Benefit:** AI technologies should benefit and empower as many people as possible.
10. **Shared Prosperity:** Economic prosperity from AI should be broadly shared across humanity.
11. **Human Control:** Humans should choose how and whether to delegate decisions to AI.
12. **Non-subversion:** AI power should improve, not undermine, social and civic processes.
13. **AI Arms Race:** An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons must be avoided.

#### C. Longer-Term Issues
1.  **Capability Caution:** Avoid strong assumptions about future AI capabilities, as no consensus exists.
2.  **Importance:** Advanced AI is a profound change; plan for and manage it with commensurate care.
3.  **Risks:** Catastrophic or existential AI risks require significant planning and mitigation efforts.
4.  **Recursive Self-Improvement:** AI designed for self-improvement/replication needs strict safety and control.
5.  **Common Good:** Superintelligence should be developed for widely shared ethical ideals and the benefit of *all humanity*, not just one entity.

### 4. Ethical Issues of Big Data

Big data, while a core of industrial growth, can create harmful data if not managed ethically. It requires ethical operation throughout its lifecycle: collection, management, use, and disposal.

#### Key Ethical Concerns:
*   **Abuse Prevention:** Ensure ethical operation and prevent misuse of big data systems.
*   **Data Security:** Implement access control, safe storage, anonymization/encryption, prevent privacy infringement, and ensure safe data destruction.
*   **Sensitive Information:** Restrict creation of big data on sensitive individual information (ideologies, beliefs, political opinions).
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Prohibit using analyzed information for purposes other than intended; prevent unauthorized use.
*   **Personal Information:** Prevent misuse and leakage of personal information.
*   **Ownership & Rights:** Establish policies on big data ownership and rights.
*   **Commercial vs. Public Good:** Address the balance of using big data for commercial profit versus public benefit (e.g., health equality, medical systems).

#### Cloudera's Four Key Principles for Ethical Data Use:
1.  **Adjust Expectations:** Align expectations between organizations and individuals on data usage.
2.  **Best Practices:** Establish strong data management best practices.
3.  **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define limitations on data use.
4.  **Supervision & Regulation:** Government, industry, or self-regulation is needed.

#### Guidelines for De-identification of Personal Data:
This ensures personal data safety when utilized in big data.
1.  **Preliminary Review:** Verify if data is personal data. Non-personal data can be used freely.
2.  **De-identification:** Apply measures (delete/replace elements) to make individuals unidentifiable. Remove attributes unrelated to data use purpose.
3.  **Adequacy Assessment:** A panel assesses if de-identified data can be easily re-identified by combining it with other data.
4.  **Follow-up Management:** Implement safety measures and monitor for re-identification during use.
    *   **Managerial Safety:** Designate a person-in-charge, prohibit data sharing, destroy data after use.
    *   **Technical Safety:** Restrict access, manage access records, install security programs.
    *   **Leakage Protection:** Analyze cause, implement further safety measures, withdraw/destroy leaked data.

### 5. Ethical Issues of Autonomous Vehicles (Self-Driving Cars)

Autonomous vehicles offer stability, convenience, and efficiency by reducing accident rates. However, they introduce significant ethical challenges:

*   **Ethical Dilemma in Accidents:** Controversy over how to handle unavoidable accidents and determine fault/responsibility.
*   **Safety Issues:** Ensuring adequate reaction to pedestrians and obstacles; occupant protection.
*   **Hacking Risks:** Remote control attacks and system availability threats due to hacking.
*   **Life and Property Loss:** Potential for life and property loss from hacking incidents.
*   **Privacy Invasion:** Leakage of personal information (travel routes, address) collected by in-vehicle sensors.
*   **Abuse as Surveillance:** Potential for vehicles to be misused as unmanned monitoring devices, invading privacy.

### 6. Ethical Issues Related to Drones

Drones are increasingly used for hobbies, filming, and industrial purposes (delivery, monitoring, agriculture), offering real-time command, surveillance, and high-definition recording. This widespread use brings ethical concerns:

*   **Physical Accidents:** Increased crashes, collisions with buildings, and flying in restricted zones.
*   **Hacking:** Disruption of remote control, theft of captured imagery/data (e.g., combat drone data, intelligence footage).
*   **Privacy Invasion:** Illegal filming, collection, and transmission of videos related to personal life.

**Crucial Point:** Before operating drones, understanding drone-related regulations and ethical guidelines is essential.

### 4. The Trolley Dilemma

**Concept:** A thought experiment in ethics (by Philippa Foot) that explores moral choices in situations where sacrificing one person might save many others. It's often used to discuss programming ethics for autonomous systems.

**How it relates to Tech:**

*   **Combat Drones:** Soldiers operating drones might distance themselves from the ethical implications of lethal actions by claiming they just followed orders, avoiding the dilemma of direct responsibility.
*   **Autonomous Vehicles:** In an unavoidable accident, an AV must "choose" between different harmful outcomes (e.g., saving the driver vs. saving multiple pedestrians). Programming an AV means deciding which lives take priority.

---

### 5. Ethical Issues of Cloud Computing

Cloud service providers have responsibilities regarding user data protection and service delivery.

**Guidance for Cloud Computing Service Providers:**

*   **User Information Protection:** Strive to protect user data and provide reliable services.
*   **Quality & Performance:** Continuously improve service quality, performance, and information protection.
*   **Incident Notification:** Promptly notify users of data leaks, service interruptions, or infringement accidents.
*   **Third-Party Sharing/Other Uses:** If providing user info to a third party or using it for non-service purposes, inform the user and obtain explicit consent.
*   **Contract Termination:** Upon contract termination, return user information and destroy all possessed copies.
*   **Business Closure:** Notify users of business closure, return user information before closure, and destroy all possessed copies.

**Privacy Policy for Cloud Computing Service Providers:**
