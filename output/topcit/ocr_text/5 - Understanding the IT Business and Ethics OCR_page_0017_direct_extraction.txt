An IT business  is pursued  as a series of steps after developing  a strategy  and establishing  a plan for adopting  an
IT business.  The IT business  process  begins right after the adoption  of the IT business.  The ultimate  output  of
this process  is an IT business  service that will generate  earnings  for the company.  This cycle then “recycles”  itself
perpetually  as IT becomes  integrated  into the company’s  business,  Thereafter,  the direction  of the IT business  can be
corrected  or improved  by evaluating  its performance  on a continuous  basis.
The management  environment  surrounding  a company  responds  with sensitivity  to changes  in politics, economy,
society, culture, and technology.  Further, the management  environment  evolves continuously  to become  fully
optimized  for the objective  of maximizing  corporate  value. As a core element  for optimizing  the management  of a
company,  IT’s integration with the service (which utilizes the latest technologies)  sets the direction  in which the IT
business  will evolve.
