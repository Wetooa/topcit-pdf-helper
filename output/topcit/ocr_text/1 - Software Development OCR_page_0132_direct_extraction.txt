01 Concept  of Open-Source  Software
A) Definition  of open-source  software
Open-source  software  is free software  that can be used, copied, and modified  by anyone  while protecting  the
rights of the creator.
As the software  industry  began to develop, a move was made to impose restrictions  on the use and
modification  of software  based on the intellectual  property  rights and license agreement  in 1980. To oppose  to
this move and protect  the rights of free software  use, Richard  Stallman  founded  the Free Software  Foundation
(FSF) and launched  the free software  movement,  which ultimately  became  the origin of open-source  software.
Open-source  software  includes FSF free software in Korea. However,  free software  pursues  the meaning  of
emphasizing  users’ freedom,  while open-source  software pursues  the idea that the source code must be
shared  for joint research  to make software  “better”.
The term “open-source  software”  was widely used at the time  the Open Source Initiative  (OSI) was formed
in 1998. The OSI manages  the promotion  and certification  of open-source  software. The OSI has defined the
minimum  standard  with which the license should comply (Open Source Definition,  OSD), and awards an OSI
certification  mark to open-source  software  certified  by the OSI.
Server software  such as the Apache  web server, PHP, MySQL,  Hadoop,  and Openstack,  development  tools such
as Eclipse  and gdb, and operating  systems  such as Linux are representative  types of open-source  software.
B) Definition  of the open-source  software  license
An open-source  software  license refers to an agreement  made between  an open-source  developer  and a
user on the method  of use and the scope of the conditions  of use. Open-source  software  should be used by
protecting  and preserving  the rights of the creator  and complying  with the conditions  set by the open-source
developer.  If the user violates  these conditions,  the user must assume legal responsibility  for violation  of the
license and infringement  of the copyright.
Representative  licenses include the General Public License (GPL), Lesser General Public License (LGPL),
Berkeley  Software  Distribution  (BSD), and Mozilla Public License  (MPL). These open-source  licenses  have been
created  and imposed  to force disclosure  of the source code within the legal boundaries.

A) Application  scope of the open-source  software  license
We need to understand  the scope of using open-source  software  before understanding the license
classification.  Obligations  are not imposed  when open-source  software  is used internally;  rather, they are
applied only when open-source  software  is distributed  and sold outside.
