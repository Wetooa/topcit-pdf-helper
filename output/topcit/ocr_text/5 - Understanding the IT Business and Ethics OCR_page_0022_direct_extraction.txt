transformation  of M2M (Machine  to Machine)  into the loT (Internet  of Things) and extending  it to the realm of
the Internet  of Everything  (loE).IT technology  is connecting  humans  to humans,  humans  to objects,  and objects
to objects, and leading our society  towards  a hyper-connected  society where humans,  objects, spaces, data, and
services  are all connected  together.

A hyper-connected  society  wields a huge influence  on the IT ecosystem,  which is built on contents,  platforms,
networks,  devices, and security,  As the center of the IT ecosystem  moves from hardware  devices  to platforms  and
contents,  software  is becoming  increasingly  important,  and smart mobile-based  IT convergence  is expanding  into
traditional  major industries,  finance,  and healthcare.
Meanwhile,  destructive  innovations  like 3D printing  and unmanned  vehicles  with the capacity  to destroy  existing
markets  are leading  the IT ecosystem  and improving  competitiveness  based on open innovation,  and demand
customized  business  models are proliferating.  The core technology  that is currently  making the hyper-connected
society possible  is ICBM technology,  which consists  of the Internet  of Things (loT), Cloud Computing,  Big Data, and
mobile.
[Table 1] explains  the changes  taking place in the IT technology  environment  and the form of IT competition  in terms
of the following  five major trends  from the perspective  of IT paradigm  change:  the change  from HW to SW platforms,
the change  from IT convergence  to smart convergence,  the ICBM-based  hyper-connected  society,  the rapid changes
in the IT technology  environment  and the IT business  transformation  of competition.

Category Description
Change  from HW to SW + The IT ecosystem  moves  from devices  (HW) to platform  contents  (SW).
platform + SW and platforms  are the key to value creation  - the engine of growth for national industries.
