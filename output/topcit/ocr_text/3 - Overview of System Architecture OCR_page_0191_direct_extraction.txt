B) UDP protocol
A UDP packet, called the user datagram,  has a fixed-size  8-byte header  made of four 2-byte (16-bit)  fields, as shown
below. Each field of the UDP header  is used for the purposes  shown in <Table 67>.
<Table  67> User Datagram  Header  Fields
Field Length Description
Source  Port 2Bytes The port number  of the source packet in the range of 0-65,535
Destination  Port 2Bytes The port number  of the destination  packet
Length 2Bytes The length of the entire packet, including  the UDP header  and data fields
Checksum 2Bytes A value to detect a data error
Data octets Variable | Storage  of data to be transmitted
The source port refers to the port of the transmitting  process,  and the destination  port refers to the port of a specific
destination  host. The length is the sum of the UDP header  (minimum  8) and the data size. The checksum  is the result
of adding 16-bit 1's complement  to the pseudo-IP  header, UDP header, and data. The checksum  field is filled with
zeros before the calculation.
As described  above, unlike TCP. the UDP protocol  is simple to implement  because  it receives  data from the application
layer and sends it down to the IP layer. It also analyzes  the UDP user datagram,  that is received  from the IP layer, and
delivers  it to an appropriate  application  program.
04 SCTP (Stream  Control  Transmission  Protocol)
A) Characteristics  of SCTP
The stream control transmission  protocol (SCTP) is a new transport  layer protocol  designed  by combining  UDP
and TCP advantages  for multimedia  communication  [3]. The service characteristics  of the SCTP are described  in
the following  table. The SCTP association  is a broader  concept  than the end-to-end  TCP connection. In an SCTP
association,  one or more IP addresses  can be connected  at each endpoint.  It is called multi-homing,  and it enables
network-level  fault tolerance. SCTP is called association  in order to highlight  its multi-homing  nature. While a stream
is transmitted  and received  to an end-to-end  connection  in TCP multiple streams  can be transmitted  and received
per association  in SCTP.
<Table 68) SCTP Service  Characteristics
Features Description
Process-to-process - _—at Provides  process-to-process  communication
Multi-stream +A multi-stream  service, called association,  is allowed in each connection.
+ The transmitting/receiving  host defines  multiple  IP addresses  on each terminal  for an
Multi-homing association.
* Only one of the IP addresses  is the primary  address,  and all others are alternative  addresses.
