Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
The results of the analysis  of the enterprise  environment  and the current state of the enterprise  constitute  an
important  resource  when determining  directions  for improvement,  developing  improved  job procedures,  and creating
an informatization  plan in the last stage of ISP establishment.
C) Key output  of ISP deployment
The ISP deployment  process  comprises  a set of activities  that must be performed  at each stage, and the results of
these activities  become  the output  of the deployment.
An example  of a list of typical outputs  that could be used in ISP is shown below:
<Table 10> Output  of each ISP stage (example)

system Define and prioritize  the project.
Although  the actual implementation  of ISP produces  far more diverse  and complex  outputs,  the most valuable  output
has to be a blueprint  for a process  for a future model and a set of activities  for attaining  a company’s  goals. This
content  must feature  sufficiently  in the output.
When comparing  ISP to the EA described  earlier, it can be said that ISP deals with plans that fall within the scope of
EA but which are more microscopic  than the EA. An examination  of the scope of ISP as described  in the table below
indicates  that its scope, when compared  to the EA, is more focused  on the informatization  strategy.
