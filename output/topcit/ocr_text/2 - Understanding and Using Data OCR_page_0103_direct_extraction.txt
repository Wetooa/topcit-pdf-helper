ESSENCE
Operator Sign Description
+ An operation  to create  a new relation  that is composed  of tuples, which is created  by combining
the tuples of two relations  that meet the join condition  in two or more relations.
+ Theta  join: A join operation  with general  join conditions  (=, <, <, >, =, 4).
Join pal + Equi-join:  A join that uses the equal condition  (=) only. The common  attribute  used in the join
appear  in duplicate.
+ Natural  join: A join that uses the equal condition  (=) only. The common  attribute  used in the join
appear  only once without  duplicates.
er . + An operation  that separates  and projects  the tuple of R where all tuples  of the relation  S exist,Division + ,when there are two relations  R and S.
03 Extended  Relational  Algebra  Operations
Useful operations  can be defined by extending  the basic relational  algebra operations.  Extended  relational  algebra
operations  such as outer join, semi join, outer union, etc. are generally  used.
<Table 38> Extended  relational  algebra  operations
Operator Sign Description
Semi join+ An operation  that performs  natural  join for the result of projecting  the relation
after the operator  with join attributes  on to the relation  before  the operator.D< «It has the same effect as projecting  the result of performing  natural join on two
relations  using the attribute  of the relation  before the operator.
Outer  join+ In this operation, if a tuple corresponding  to a tuple in one relation  does not exist
in the other relation,  it is not excluded,  but the other is changed  to a Null tuple to
pet include it in the result.
+ All tuples of the two join relations  are included  in the result relation
Outer union
102 TOPCIT  ESSENCE+ An operation  that creates  a union by expanding  the sequence  number  of two
U relations that cannot be completely  merged.
