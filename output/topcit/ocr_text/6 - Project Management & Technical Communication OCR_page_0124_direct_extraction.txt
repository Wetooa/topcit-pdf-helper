03 Quality Evaluation  Perspective  and Quality  Standard
A) Quality  evaluation  perspective
Quality  evaluation  perspective  can be divided into product  quality  and process  quality.
@ Product  Quality
It is technique that evaluates  the functionality  and reliability  of a product  made by a project, and ISO/IEC  9126
and 6 Sigma are the most common  quality  standards.
@ Process  Quality
It is a technique  that evaluates  whether  a process is defined and properly  operated  from the viewpoint  that
a good product  comes from a good process,  and ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 12207, and CMMI are widely used quality
standards,
B) Quality  standard
@ ISO/IEC  9126 (currently  known as ISO/IEC  25000-2)
It is a quality model created  through  standardization  on software  quality characteristics  from the  user's point
of view by ISO(International  Organization  for Standardization),  an international  standardization  organization,  as
a specific  definition  for standardization  and quality assurance  of quality  characteristics  and metrics  is required.
<Table 58> ISO/IEC  9126 (currently  known as ISO/IEC  25000-2)
Classification Content
ISO 9126-1[Consists  of 6 quality  characteristics  and 21 subcharacteristics]
Enable those involved  in purchasing,  requirements,  development,  use, evaluation,  support,  maintenance,
quality  assurance,  and software  auditing  to define and evaluate  the quality  of software  products  from
different  perspectives.
ISO 9126-2[External  metrics]
It refers to the external  properties  that appear  while in use, and measures  the final product,  which is the
closing  stage of software,  from the user’s and manager's  point of view
ISO 9126-3[Internal  metrics]
Interim products  are measured  by creating  a measurement  table for each evaluation  factor by
development  stage based on internal software  properties
ISO 9126-4It measures  whether  the goals for efficiency,  productivity,  safety and satisfaction  are met when using the
finished  software
@ ISO 12207
As a standard
Development
maintenance.ization for software  process, it is a quality model that provides  standards across the Software
Life Cycle (SDLC) for systematic  software  acquisition,  supply, development,  operation,  and
The basic framework  for communication  by software  practitioners  in development  and management  was
defined  and presented  at a high level.
