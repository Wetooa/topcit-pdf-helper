Gartner, which annually publishes strategic  technologies  for the year, began including  virtualization  in
“Gartner's  Top Ten Strategic  Technologies’  in 2006 and added cloud computing  in 2009. AWS started its
service in 2006, achieved  annual sales of 5 trillion won in 2014, and generated  tremendous  sales growth
every year. Now, cloud services  are becoming  a necessity, not an option. Most of the technologies,  such as
Al, big data, and blockchain,  which have recently  become  the subject  of conversation,  operate  based on
cloud services  that basically  provide scalability  and speed. It is why most cloud service providers  provide
platforms  for new technologies.  The server virtualization  is changing.  In the past, server virtualization
was performed  using a hypervisor.  In recent  years, container-type  virtualization  has emerged.  It is quickly
establishing  a position  in the cloud service market because  it is lighter and faster than the existing
methods.  Typical  container  technologies  include Linux Containers  (LxC), Docker,  Kubernetes,  and Openshift.
01 Definition  of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing  was developed  to efficiently  utilize the surplus computer  capacity  of each server  and to flexibly
respond  to the demand  of uncertain  services  at enterprises.  While users had to own and manage  resources  in order
to use computer  resources  before the advent of cloud computing,  cloud computing  allows them to use computing
resources,  provided  through  the Internet,  in a virtualized  form when they need them.
The key to cloud computing  is that computer  resources  are available  through  the network  and are provided  in an
invisible  state so that users can work anywhere  using the computer  resources  they need, even without  knowing  the
complex  interior.  Around 2008, various  services  that utilize computing  resources  on the Internet  were launched,  and
“cloud computing”  began to be used as a comprehensive  term. Users could access  desired  services  from the Internet
without  requiring  expertise  in the technology  infrastructure  they support.
The following  benefits  are expected  from cloud services.
* Costs: CAPEX® reduction,  OPEX’ increase,  and TCO® reduction
+ Period: Reduced  development  time and product  development  cycle
* Operation:  Reduced  operating  personnel  and strengthened  resource  efficiency
+ Product:  Improved  product  integration
Although  the terms “cloud service”  and “cloud computing”  are generally  used interchangeably,  the Korea
6 CAPEX (Capital  expenditure):  Expenditures  spent to generate  future profits
7 OPEX: Operating  expenditure
8 TCO (Total Cost of Ownership):  Total cost of owning  a system,  including  the initial investment  and maintenance  costs
