C) Schedule  compression  technique  - crashing  and fast tracking
The most common  cause of schedule  compression  in a typical project is requirements  change. Despite
frequent  changes  in the requirements,  the project  finish date cannot be changed  in reality, so there are many
cases where it is necessary  to shorten  the development  schedule  or test schedule  at the end of the project.
Here are some typical schedule  compression  techniques.
@ Crashing
Crashing  is a technique  that compresses  the schedule  by adding extra resources  at minimum  cost. Examples
of crashing  include approval  of overtime  work, replenishment  of resources,  and payment  for activities  in the
critical path. Crashing  is effective  only for activities  of which duration  is shortened  by replenishing  resources  in
the critical path. However,  crashing  may lead to an increase  in cost. It can also lead to an increase  in the risk
due to sharing  the contents  of an existing  project  for new human resources  or many communication  channels,
@ Fast Tracking
Fast Tracking  is a method  of shortening  a certain period  of time in which activities  or steps that are performed
sequentially  are conducted  simultaneously  in a specific  section of a certain duration.  For example,  it is the
case where the foundations  are built before all architectural  drawings  are completed.  Fast tracking  can lead to
rework or an increase  in the risk. Fast tracking is effective  only when activities  can be overlapped  to shorten
the project  duration.
