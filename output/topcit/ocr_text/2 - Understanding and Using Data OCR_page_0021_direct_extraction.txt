A) Concept  and characteristics  of data, information,  and knowledge
@ Data
Data refers to the collected  resource  itself, which are the basic data discovered,  investigated, collected,  and created
in the real world. That is, data are related  to a fact, which refers to a natural  state free of the values  and judgments  of
human beings.
Q Information
Information  refers to various data that are organized,  classified,  and systematized  for certain purposes  according  to
certain rules. When data are processed  in a certain form, the information  necessary  for achieving  a specific  purpose  is
created,
@ Knowledge
Knowledge  refers to matter  that is generalized  from several  items of concrete  information.  It is created  while analyzing
and studying  the meaning  and relationship  of informational  data. Correlations  between  information  should be
established  to convert  information  into knowledge.  Therefore,  information  can vary significantly  depending  on how one
assigns  meaning  to informatized  data, analyzes  the relationship,  and judges  the values of the human  being. Enterprises
and institutions  manage  such information  or knowledge  in such a way as to make decisions  or create  added value.
