Information  security )
Two systems,  A and B, that are in a trusted relationship  in the network  environment  can use a service that
enables  the user to log into system B using the system A account,  which is called trust authentication.
Authentication  is performed  by the trust service  on the network,  based on the network  address, not the
password.  That is, the server stores the trusted client IP addresses  and allows log-in without  an ID and
password,  if the client with the saved IP address  requests  log-in.
To respond  to IP spoofing,  it is recommended  not to use trust authentication,  except under special
circumstances,
+ DNS spoofing
If an attacker  takes control of the DNS server of a certain domain,  the user can be connected  to the system
designated  by the attacker,  because  the user finally obtains  that IP address  even though the user intended
to obtain the IP address  of the other system.  That is, the attacker  sniffs the DNS, designated  by the user, to
request  address  translation  and traffic from the higher-level  DNS site that gives the response,  and it passes
the IP address  of the attacker's  intended  site as the final response.
To respond  to DNS spoofing,  the IP address  of the important  access server can be registered  in the host file,
so the IP address  can be obtained  without  querying  the DNS server. However, it is realistically  impossible  to
register  and manage  the IP addresses  of all servers.
02 Security  protocols  and security  solutions
A) IPSec
@® Concept
The |Pv4 (Internet  Protocol  version 4) has no authentication  function  and is vulnerable  to attacks, such as
eavesdropping  or packet alteration.  IPsec (Internet  Protocol  Security)  was developed  to make up for the
security  vulnerability  of IP. IPSec provides  security  functions  to all application  programs  because  it supports
the safe operation  of the IP, by providing  encryption  and authentication  services  to the IP by packet unit. IPsec
encompasses  three functional  areas: authentication,  confidentiality,  and key management.  It is optional  in Ipv4,
but implemented  as a basic function  in IPv6.
@ Composition  and operation
[Figure 61] shows that when an organization  uses the LAN distributed  in several places, IP traffic is transmitted
within the LAN, but outgoing  traffic of the LAN is transmitted  using IPSec protocol  for safe communication.
The IPSec protocol  runs on the device, such as the router or firewall, which is transparently  visible to the
computers  on the LAN.
