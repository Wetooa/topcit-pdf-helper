01 loT Network-Based  Technology
A) loT concept
loT (Internet  of Things)  is a concept  that embeds  sensors  and communication  functions  in various  objects  to connect
to the Intemet.  It refers to the technology  that can perform  sensing,  networking,  and information  processing,  through
cooperation,  without  explicit human intervention.  At the same time, the ubiquitous  technology  that allows access
to information  and communication  networks,  regardless  of time and place as a concept  that exists anywhere  at the
same time and is ubiquitous  and the machine-to-machine  (M2M) technology  that enables  intelligent  communication
between  objects  have evolved  further. As such, loT enables all things to exchange  information  through  the Internet,
without  boundaries  between  people  and objects.

B) loT standardization  trend
3GPP and ETSI have established  mobile communication-based  loT standards,  but since 2012, they have been led
by an international  consultative  body called, oneM2M.  The Open Mobile  Alliance  (OMA) proposed  a communication
method,  based on a server-client  structure,  by establishing  the Lightweight  M2M (LWM2M)  protocol.  oneM2M  has
released  LWM2M,  which applies CoAP (Constrained  Application  Protocol)  and HTTP for data transfer,  as the latest
standard.
