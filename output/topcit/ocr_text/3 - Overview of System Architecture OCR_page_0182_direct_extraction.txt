Overview  of System Architecture )
UDP is usually referred to as a connectionless  service. However,  it does not mean that the service is performed
without  a connection,  but that the pre-configuration  process  for connection  is omitted,  and that data can be sent
and received  immediately.  On the other hand, TCP is a connection-oriented  service and requires  a pre-configuration
process  to connect  before sending  and receiving  data. The connection  is terminated  in order to end the service
between  the client and server  after completing  the data transmission  and reception.
Reliability  is a factor mentioned,  along with the concept  of connection-orientation,  when referring  to TCP and
UDP. UDP is generally  considered  an unreliable  protocol,  and TCP is considered  to provide reliable interprocess
communication.  TCP uses an acknowledgment  technique  that uses a sequence  number  and an acknowledgment
number  to check whether  the receiving  side has properly  received  the transmitted  data.
02 TCP
A) Characteristics  of TCP
TCP is positioned  between  the application  layer and the network  layer in a TCP/IP  model and provides  communication
between  the application  layer processes.  TCP is a stream-based  protocol  and has the transmission  buffer and the
reception  buffer to transfer  data. IP at the lower layer of the TCP protocol,  transmits  data in a packet  format, rather
than a stream format, by partitioning the data into several segments.  Flow control, error control, and congestion
control techniques  are defined  to reliably  deliver  data. TCP is numbered  in units of bytes. When a byte is numbered,  a
sequence  number  is assigned  to the segment.  The maximum  value must be set for a header  to include  the sequence
number  of each packet. If m bits are set for the sequence  number  in the packet  header,  the sequence  number  ranges
from 0 to 2m-1. The sequence  number  is modular  2m.
@ Flow control
Flow control controls  the packet  flow volume  to prevent  packet loss, due to packet inputs exceeding  the reception
limit when transmitting  data packets.  The flow control uses transmission  and reception  buffers  that can store packets
at the sending/receiving  sides, and the sizes of the sending/receiving  buffers are specified  in the files /proc/sys/net/
core/wmem_max  and /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max,  respectively  for Linux systems.
@ Error control
Error control  detects  code errors, that occur during transmission,  and reproduces  accurate  information.  It detects  and
discards  damaged  packets,  tracks and resends  lost or removed  packets,  and checks and discards  duplicate  received
packets.
© Congestion  control
Congestion  occurs when the network  load, representing  the number  of packets  transmitted  to the network  per unit
time, exceeds  the network  capacity,  representing  the number  of packets  that can be processed  by the network  per
unit time. In TCP. the congestion  control controls  issues, such as end-to-end  congestion,  and ensures  that the load is
smaller  than the network  bandwidth.
