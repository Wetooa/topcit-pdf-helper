>> Recent  trends and major issues
The world has now entered a new era of limitless  quality competition,  and software  cannot be an
exception  to the rule. Software  design is closely related to software  quality. In this respect,  we can
see that efforts to analyze  the requirements  are also a process  for good design. The cost possibility
of software failure can be significantly  reduced if quality control and prevention  activities  are
performed  frequently  in the analysis  and design phase.

2. To be able to explain the concepts  of cohesion  and coupling,  which are the criteria for evaluating
the design of a module.
3. To be able to understand  structural  design methods  and express  design contents.
