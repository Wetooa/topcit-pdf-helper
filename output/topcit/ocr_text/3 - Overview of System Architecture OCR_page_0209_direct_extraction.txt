03 Media Transport  Protocols
Media transport  protocols  include RTP (Real-Time  Transport  Protocol),  RTCP (Real-Time  Control Protocol),  and RTSP
(Real-Time  Streaming  Protocol).  RTP is designed  to process  real-time  traffic over the Internet.  It is mainly used to
transmit  video or audio data in real time over the Internet.  RTCP is a protocol  to control  the RTP (Real-time  Transport
Protocol)  for streaming  video or audio over the Internet.  RTP and RTCP are specified  in the IETF standard  document
RFC 1889. RTSP is designed  for use in entertainment  and communication  systems  to control streaming  media
servers, RTP is used to establish  and control media sessions  between  endpoints,  and it does not actually  transmit
media streaming  data. Most RTSP servers transfer  actual audio/video data to the transport layer, using the RTP
protocol.
A) RTP
RTP is designed  to process  real-time  traffic over the Internet.  It is mainly used to transmit  video or audio data in real
time over the Internet.  It is performed  over the UDP (user datagram  protocol)  of the transport  layer.
In the RTP protocol,  the transmitting  side that sends the media file, converts  the media unit data compressed  with
the codec into an RTP packet and sends it to the receiving  side, using UDP. Since it is transmitted  using UDP RTP
does not guarantee  that packets  are delivered  within a specified  time and are not lost. Therefore,  the video and audio
applications  must process  packets,  using information  included  in the RTP packet  header. RTCP can ensure the QoS of
RTP and synchronization  of media streams.
B) RTCP
RTCP controls  RTP, a protocol  for streaming  video or audio over the Internet.  It is an IETF standard  defined  together
with RTP in RFC 1889. RTCP packet  types include  the sender  report packet,  receiver  report packet, source  description
message,  bye message,  and application-specific  packet.
C) RTSP
RTSP is an application  layer protocol that transmits  real-time  media. The communication  protocol developed  by
IETF in 1998 is defined in RFC 2326. It is a communication  protocol  for transmitting  and receiving  audio and moving
pictures  in real time,as  well as a standard  protocol  for controlling  streaming  data on the Internet.  It is used to remotely
control media servers. Its commands  are similar  to VCR operations,  such as "PLAY" and "PAUSE",  and it accesses  the
server, based on time information.
D) IMS.
IMS was first proposed  by the 3GPP (3rd Generation  Partnership  Project)  group that develops  international  standards
in the wireless  communication  field. It is an infrastructure  for providing  IP multimedia  services  and uses SIP protocol-
based call control as a core technology.
