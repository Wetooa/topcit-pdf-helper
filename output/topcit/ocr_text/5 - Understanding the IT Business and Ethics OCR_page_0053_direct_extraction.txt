In other words, the EA is deployed  under a company’s  target architecture  and incorporates  the latest information
technology  so that it can align the direction  of its IT with its management  strategy.  Therefore,  the EA must be
managed  in a way that allows a company  to respond  quickly  to changes  in the business  management  environment,
and must be flexible, so that the company’s  agenda can be implanted  quickly  through  continuous  updating,  and in a
way that ensures  that the roadmap  is shared with the rest of the organization.
