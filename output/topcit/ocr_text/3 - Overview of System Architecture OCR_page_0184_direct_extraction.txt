The connection  request  in step © is actually  a simple drawing  of steps © through  @, and the connection  termination
in step @ is also a simple drawing  of steps @ through  @. Steps @ through  © and  © through  @ are application  layer
data that is immediately  appended  after the TCP header. According  to the HTTP protocol,  this data is generated  by
the web browser  on user A’s computer  and the my.server.com  web server program.  The following  section describes
he TCP protocol  and corresponding  steps in detail.
TCP flow control is important  when a large volume of data, such as PDF files, is transmitted  simultaneously,  as
shown in steps  © through  @, because  IP packets  can be transmitted  through  multiple network  paths. Error control
is crucial to cope with transmission  errors. Moreover,  it is also necessary  to understand  congestion  control, since the
ransmission  of more packets  that can be processed  per unit time in the network,  greatly  affects  TCP performance.
C) TCP protocol
The header  format used in the TCP protocol  is shown in the following  figure [1].
When adding an option, it is necessary  to add a padding  byte to fit the 4-byte unit. When there is no option,  the TCP
header  is 20 bytes, which is the same size as the IP header. Therefore,  the TCP/IP header is 40 bytes and must be
sent, even when sending  one byte of user data. For effective network  transmission  in an application  layer program,
data larger than an appropriate  size must be sent to the transport  layer.
{Table 61) TCP Protocol  Header  Components
Type Description
+ Defines  the port number  of the host application  sending  the segment  (16 bits)
+ Performs  the same purpose  as the source port number  in the UDP header
+ Defines  the port number  of the host application  receiving  the segment  (16 bits)Source  port address
Destination  port address  | | porforms  the same purpose as the destination  port number in the UDP header
Se eeenol + Defines the number  assigned  to the first byte of data contained  in the segment  (32 bits)
BSG + The byte number  that the segment  sender expects to receive (32 bits)
+ TCP header  expressed  as the number  of 4 bytes (4 bits)
+ (Header  length: 20 - 60 bytes)
Control + 6 different  control fields or flag bit definition
+ The window  size in bytes that the other party must maintain
+ 16-bit  long. The maximum  window  size is 65,536 bytes.Header  length
Windows + The data size that can be sent to the segment, used by the windowing  mechanism
+ Buffer size
Checksum + Error detection  for all checksums  and segments  (16 bits)
Urgent  pointer + Valid only when the urgent  flag value is set (16 bits)
+ Used when the segment  contains  urgent  data
The sequence  number  SEQ (sequence  number)  increases  by increments  of 1 for each 8-bit octet and performs  the
unsigned  module  2” calculation.  Therefore,  the sequence  value changes  to make 0 > 2” - 10>:
The six flags for control have the following  meanings.  The SYN, ACK, and FIN control  flags are widely used in the TCP.
protocol.
+ URG: The urgent  pointer  field is meaningful.
