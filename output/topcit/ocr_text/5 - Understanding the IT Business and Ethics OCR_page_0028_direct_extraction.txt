B) Company-wide  integration  of the value chain model and IT
IT is being applied  throughout  all the key activities  and support  activities  that constitute  the elements  of a company’s
value chain model. This signifies  that the role of IT is no longer limited to back-office  functions,  but that IT is being
integrated  and utilized as a key factor in every aspect  of a company’s  key activities.
For example,  let's look at the typical example  of a hypermarket.  Without  IT, would it be possible  to pursue the five
key activities  of the value chain model normally  or do it in a way that would be competitive?  In an environment  where
managers  working  for a hypermarket  can check inventory  and product  information  in realtime,  place products  on
shelves  in ways that reflect  customer  shopping  behaviors  and local characteristics,  and collect customers’  purchasing
histories  in realtime,  the answer  to this question  would be a resounding  ‘NO’. In other words, today, when the
operations  of all key activities  defined by the value chain model are based on IT, the above question  suggests  a new
perception  about the convergence  of the value chain model and IT. Leaving  aside the example  of hypermarkets,  the
situation  is pretty much the same in other industries  referred  to as “smokestack  industries”.
C) Value chain model and IT specialized  companies
When a company’s  business  model is e-business  or Internet  business,  it is hard to explain its key activities  and
support  activities  separately  from IT. For example,  Amazon.com  is a leading  example  of a company  that performs
both its key activities  and its supporting  activities  using IT. Likewise,  Interpark  in Korea is considered  a similar case. In
other words, companies  that began their operations  as [T-based  entities  cannot be understood  if the key activities
and support  activities  defined in their value chain models  are considered  separately.  In such situations,  the traditional
value chain model has to be approached  from a new perspective.
D) Expansion  of the value chain model
The two perspectives  explained  above are related to the two angles mentioned  when explaining  the IT business.
Just as when one tries to understand  the IT business,  one must view it in terms of two different  trends,  that’s to say
one in which IT is integrated  into the business  processes  across the whole company,  and another  in which IT is used
as the main business,  the value chain model can also be understood  in two different  ways. Therefore,  since most
companies  today are pursuing  their IT business  in the hope of gaining a competitive  edge from IT, our understanding
of the traditional  value chain model must also be expanded  from the business  perspective.
Such an expanded  understanding  of IT is raising several issues in academia  and in the field. Traditional  job processes
that have long been taken for granted are driving structural  changes  in companies  following  the company-wide
integration  of IT. Examples  include the elimination  of unnecessary  processes  in the decision-making  process  through
the adoption  of an intranet  information  system, and the transformation  of a company  into a more horizontal
organization  in which quality information  is supplied  to all employees  - information  that otherwise  would have been
held by a privileged  few. That is, the perception  is spreading  that the utilization  of IT is not limited  to just being
integrated  into the value chain model activities,  but that it is a (new) concept  of value chain model that could have a
decisive  impact  on the structure  of an entire organization  and its competitive  advantages.
