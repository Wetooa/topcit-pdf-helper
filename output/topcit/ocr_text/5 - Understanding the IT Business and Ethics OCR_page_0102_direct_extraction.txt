BI provides  ETL (Extraction,  Transformation,  Load) operations  on data with which enterprises  can maintain  the
consistency  and compatibility  of OLTP (Online Transaction  Processing)  data. These features,  naturally  enough, are
also included  in the EDW described  earlier; and, as indicated  by the component  elements,  it needs to be understood
that the set of processes  for collecting,  analyzing  and visualizing data, as well as the functions  for supporting
decision-making,  are in an organic  relationship  with each other.
BI consists  of a data warehouse  that stores data, a data mart where different  perspectives  can be applied and
analyzed  in multi-dimensions,  analysis tools, and dashboards  that generate  charts, simulations,  statistical  analysis,
and predictions  for visualization.
In addition,  for decision  makers, Bl can supply them with a visual presentation  of an analysis  of key management
metrics  that would normally  be released  as a standardized  summary  report. For managers  in the field, Bl provides  a
multidimensional  analytical  tool called OLAP with which they can perform  expert-level  analyses.
® Types of Bl
The types of Bl can be explained  by separating  them into 3 following  areas. They are BI, which represents  the
goals and strategies  of an enterprise:  analysis  Bl, which is about data-driven  analysis Bl; and operational  BI, which
is centered  on the day-to-day  operations  of the personnel  in charge of a specific operation.  These types of BI are
summarized  in detail as follows.
