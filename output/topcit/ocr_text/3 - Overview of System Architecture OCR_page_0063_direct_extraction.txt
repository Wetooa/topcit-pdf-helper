John Doe, who works for company  A, is a software  engineer  with four years of development  experience.
Java is the programming  language  he generally  uses, but he was recently  given a task that required him
to program  using C. Since the Java language  managed  memory  in a runtime  environment,  called the Java
Virtual Machine  (JVM), it was not necessary  to pay much attention  to memory  during programming,  When
developing  with the C language,  he had to leam the concept  of memory,  such as memory  allocation  and
retum. Most importantly,  he had to learn the memory  address  system through  pointers.  He had to be
familiar  with computer  structure  to be able to develop  software  in C effectively.  This chapter  describes  the
computer  structure  in detail.
01 Computer  Structure  and Architecture
A) Basic computer  structure
The basic function of a computer  is to run a program  code in the specified  sequence.  In other words, it reads,
processes,  and stores the needed  data. [Figure 30] shows the main components  of a computer.
+ Central Processing  Unit (CPU): Also, commonly  known as a processor,  it plays a key role of the program  running  and
data processing.
+ Memory:
- Main memory:  Closely located to the CPU, it consists  of memory  semiconductor  chips. It can be accessed  at a
high speed and can be used only as temporary  storage  because  it has no permanent  storage  capabilities.
- Auxiliary  storage device: The secondary  storage device can be accessed  at a low speed because  it includes
mechanical  devices.  It has a high storage  density,  and it is moderately  priced. Disks and magnetic  tapes are some
examples.
