Overview  of System Architecture )
[Figure 102] below shows an example  of MapReduce  outputting  the frequency  of words included  in a character  string.
The process  consists  of dividing  the string data by line (splitting)  > Receiving  the string by line and outputting  it in the
form of <Key, Value> (mapping)  — Separating  data by the key (shuffling)  >Calulating  the sum of the frequency  of each
key and outputting  it (reducing) Combines  the output  data and stores it in the Hadoop  file system (final result).

C) Hadoop  support  program
As shown in <Table 31>, Hadoop  support  service  programs  to collect, store, utilize, process,  and manage  big data, are
in development.
