04 Integrated  Development  Environment  (IDE)
A) Concept  of an integrated  development  environment  (IDE)
An Integrated  Development  Environment  (IDE) is a type of software  used for development  purposes  that
provides  an environment  in which tasks related to all program  development  can be handled  with one software,
such as coding,  debugging,  compilation,  and distribution.  Separate software  had to be used in the traditional
development  environment  in order to use such diverse functions  as the compiler,  text editor, debugger,  and
remote server accessor.  However, the IDE bundles  all these functions  into a single tool and provides  it via an
interactive  interface.  Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode are popular IDEs that support  various programming
languages.
<Table 27> Components  of the integrated  development  environment  (IDE)
Component Description
Editor A tool used to input and edit codes for programming.
A tool used to convert  code written  in programming  languages  into machine-readable  code, such
as the compiler,  interpreter,  linker, etc.
Debugger A tool for detecting  errors while running  a program.
Project  management A tool that is used to manage  a project  by providing  a system  of collaboration  system  between  teams.Build tool
B) Cl(Continuous  Integration)
@ Concept  of Cl (Continuous  Integration)
Continuous  Integration  (Cl) is a software development  activity  that frequently  integrates  the results of a
team composed  of several members.  Each developer  performs  automated  build and testing,  and then merges
changes  to the code in the central repository.  Codes are merged several times per day (at least once per day)
after quickly  checking  and verifying  any errors during automation  build.
From a software  engineering  perspective,  Cl is performed  to continuously  control quality during software
development.  Cl aims to minimize  the time required  to improve  software  quality and distribution  by replacing
the classic method  of quality  control.
@ Necessity  of Cl (Continuous  Integration)
+ Builds configuration  management.
+ Provides  an environment  in which developers  can concentrate  on development  activities  only.
+ Detects  and eliminates  problems  that may arise when integrating  codes in advance.
+ Supports  a development  process (agile technique,  etc.) that receives  feedback  frequently  based on frequent
deployment.
