<Table 30> Classification  of anomalies
Type Anomaly
If a supplier  wants to input new association  information  for a part, the supplier  should consider  the association
between  the supplier  and project  and the association  between  the part and project.
Modification  | To modify  the association  information  for a supplier  and a part, multiple  records  should be modified  because
error other associations  should also be considered.
If the association  information  for a supplier  and a part is deleted,  the association  information  for a supplier  and
a project, as well as the association  information  for a part and a project,  are also deleted.

1 A supplier  handles  a certain part. (A and  B are related.) Created
2 It can be known whether  a part has been used for a certain  project.  (A and C are Created
related.)
8 A supplier  supports  a certain project.  (B and C are related.) Created
It cannot  be known whether  a supplier  supports  a certain project  using a certain
“ part. (A, B, and C are not related.) Not created

06 Denormalization
A) Concept  and procedure  of denormalization
@ Definition:  The process  of integrating  data models for normalized  entities,  attributes,  and relationships  in order to
improve  system  performance  and simplify  development  and operations.
@ Considerations:  Data consistency  and integrity  > System  performance  and data model simplicity
@ Procedure  of denormalization
+ Investigating  denormalization  targets: Range processing  frequency,  large range processing,  aggregation  process,
