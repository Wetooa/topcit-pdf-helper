B) Chasm  trap
@ The chasm trap means that desired information  cannot be found due to the disconnection of the information  flow
when there is an optional  relationship  rather  than a mandatory  relationship.
@ ([Figure  26]) shows an example  of the chasm trap.
+ [Figure 26(a)] shows a case in which several branches  are registered  in one branch, with each vehicle being owned
by one employee.
+ In this case, we can know to which branch the employee  who owns a vehicle belongs,  but we cannot  know to which
branch the employee  who does not own a vehicle  belongs.
* To eliminate  the chasm trap, a relationship  that is missing,  even though it is required  in terms of meaning,  should be
explicitly  linked again ([Figure  26(b)]).
