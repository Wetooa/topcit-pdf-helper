Company  ‘A’ is a company  whose main focus is its financial  business.  As the company’s  capabilities  grew,
so did its size, leading  each department  and team to begin installing  its own small systems  here and there.
This in turn led to overlapping  developments  and other difficulties  associated  with development.  Compared
to the allocated  budget,  the level of informatization  attained  was disappointingly  low.
Thus, company  ‘A’ decided  to adopt an EA after recognizing  the need to establish  a plan-based
informatization  strategy  aimed at preventing  or eliminating  development  efforts that could overlap  or be
carried out indiscriminately.  It conducted  inspections  of and reengineered  its current business processes,
and established  mid-to-long-term  plans for the job responsibilities  each of its stakeholders,  as well as its
applications,  data, and technologies.
Furthermore,  the company  established  information  strategy  planning  in order to develop  informatization
strategies  at the division level. When establishing  the ISP, the company  devised  a plan that used the
current information  of the EA to prevent  any overlapping  of development  activities  and indiscriminate
development.  The adoption  of ISP made it possible  for the company  to derive the detailed  requirements  of
each individual  system and to set up a system for the efficient  calculation  and verification  of the business
scope, schedules,  and budgets.
