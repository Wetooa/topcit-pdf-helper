Database )
+ Preview  for practical  business
There are many cases in which a database  is used like an existing  file system,  and tables are created  in the
database,  but each table is actually  dependent  on individual  applications,  screens,  and reports.
For example,  when developing  a book management  system  for each team a booklist  table can be created
for each team during implementation  of the database  in the same way as managing  books using Excel files.
However,  if tables are designed  in the same way as Excel files, the advantages  of the database,  including
integration,  storage,  operation,  and sharing,  cannot  be utilized at all.
In this case, the complexity  of the application  program  also increases,  causing  problems  that can lead to
serious symptoms,  such as an increase  in the development  cost, problems  with data integrity  (lack of
consistency  due to data duplication),  and deterioration  of data processing  performance.  Therefore,  these
problems  can be prevented,  and the advantages  of the database  can be maximized  and applied  to system
development  only when we understand  the definition  and characteristics  of the database  (integration,
storage,  operation,  sharing)  and its advantages,  and apply them to practical  business.
