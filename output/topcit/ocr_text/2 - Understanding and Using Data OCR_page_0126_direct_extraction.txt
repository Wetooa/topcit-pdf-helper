Item Contents
+ Occurs  when transactions  update  the same data simultaneously.
Lost update + Occurs  when the later transaction  overwrites  the update  value before the previous  transaction
has completed  the transaction  after updating  the data.
Dirty read + Other transactions  refer to the intermediate  execution  result of a transaction.
Inconsistency + A database  remains  inconsistent  when two transactions  are executed  at the same time.
+ When a specific  transaction  cancels  processing  if data is shared by multiple  transactions,  the
part processed  by other transactions  cannot  be canceled.
+ When a transaction  executes  the same query twice, the query results differ because  other
transactions  have modified  or deleted  the value in the middle.Cascading  rollback

E) Concurrency  control  techniques
@ Lock-based  technique
@ Timestamp-based  technique
@ Multi-version  technique
@ Verification  (optimistic)  based technique
F) What is the 2PL (2-Phase  Locking)  technique?
@ The 2-phase  locking  technique  controls  concurrency  by guaranteeing  serialization  and follows  the 2PL protocol,  which
performs  jobs by dividing  ‘lock’ and ‘unlock’  operations  into the expansion  and contraction  phases.
+ Expansion  phase: A phase in which a transaction  can perform  locking  only, and cannot  perform  unlocking.
+ Contraction  phase: A phase in which a transaction  can perform  unlocking  only, and cannot  perform  locking.

@If all lock operations  (Read_lock,  Write_lock)  appear  before the first unlock operation,  the transaction  conforms  to the
2PL protocol.
