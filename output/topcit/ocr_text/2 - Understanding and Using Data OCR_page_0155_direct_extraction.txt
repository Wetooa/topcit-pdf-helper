Artificial  intelligence  (Al) refers to a technology  that studies how computers  can think, leam, and develop
by themselves  like a human intelligence.  Previously,  Al imitated  human beings as a computer  technology,
but it now is being applied  to most industrial  sectors  including  the military,  aviation,  medical,  manufacturing,
communication,  public administration,  and life services  fields. We are now living in an era in which the ethical
and institutional  issues of Al must be considered,  not to mention  the technical  issues.
