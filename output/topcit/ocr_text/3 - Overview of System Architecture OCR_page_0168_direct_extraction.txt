Initialization
Tree = {root} Tree is made only  of the root
for (y=1 to N) N is the number of  nodes
{
if (y is the root)
Diy] =0 D|y] is shortest  distance  from root to node y
else if (y is a neighbor)
Dly] = c[root][y] c[x]ly] is cost between  nodes x and y in LSDB
else

@ Bellman-Ford  Algorithm
The Bellman-Ford  Algorithm  is the leading  distance  vector  routing  algorithm.
The shortest  path can be decomposed  as follows, by expanding  the optimal substructure  of the shortest  path
problem.  The shortest  path from the starting  node s to v, is the sum of the shortest  path from s to u, and the weight
factor (distance)  between  u and v.
D(s, v) = D(s, u) + w(u, v)
The Bellman-Ford  Algorithm  performs  edge relaxation  of all edges in the graph, when calculating  the shortest  path
between  s and u. Then, how many times should it be performed?  The shortest  path between  s and u may be only s
