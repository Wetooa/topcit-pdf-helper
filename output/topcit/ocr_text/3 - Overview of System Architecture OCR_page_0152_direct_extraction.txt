109]. Forward error correction  (FEC) allows the receiving  device to detect errors and recover  from them by itself,
by transmitting  a spare bit for error recovery  in the packet. Backward  error correction  (BEC) notifies  an error to the
transmitting  device  to recover  from the error, when an error occurs  during the data transmission.

@ Error detection
Error detection uses the redundancy  (spare) concept  by adding a spare bit to detect the destination’s  error. Error
detection  methods  include VRC (Vertical Redundancy  Check), LRC (Longitudinal  Redundancy  Check), CRC (Cyclic
Redundancy  Check),  and checksum.  <Table 32> shows details of each detection  method.

Error detection Description
method
wre + Vertical Redundancy  Check
+ Most widely used for error detection  and includes  the parity check
+ Longitudinal  Redundancy  Check
LRC + Amethod  of collecting  the even parity of all bytes to create a data unit and adding it to the end of the
data block
ERG * Cyclic redundancy  check
+ A detection  method  using binary division
Checksum + Amethod  used by higher-level  protocols  and based on the concept  of redundancy  (VRC, LRC, CRC, etc.)
