he or she does not have decision-making  authority  in the project  and plays  a facilitating  role.
+ Projectized  Organization:  It is an organizational  structure  in which the project manager  is responsible  for
decision-making  and has total authority  for project execution.  It shares the same physical space by project,
allowing  prompt  communication  and decision-making.
+ Matrix Organization:  Matrix organization  is a complex  form of functional  organization  and project-oriented
organization,  and can be divided into weak, balanced  matrix, and strong matrix structure.  The weak matrix
organization  is similar to the functional  organization,  and the project manager  acts as a facilitator.  The
balanced matrix organization  is a structure  in which members  of the functional  organization  play the role of
project managers.  The project manager  acts as a coordinator  with the right to decision-making  and partial
authority.  The strong matrix organization  is similar to the projectized  organization,  and a separate project
manager  apart from the functional  organization  focuses  on project management  and is responsible for much
decision-making  and authority.
