The system architecture  is becoming  more complex  as new technologies,  such as big data, cloud
computing,  and loT, have gained attention.  While the system  architecture  consisted  of a simple combination
of servers, storage,  and network  in the past, its configuration  is changing  to meet the requirements  of
the new technologies  to provide high-performance  computing  power, high-capacity  memory,  and high-
speed communication.  In line with these changes, the  system architecture is becoming  more important.
The system  architecture  is an essential  concept  in a practical  environment  for system  implementation  and
operation.
