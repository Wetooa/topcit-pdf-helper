@® Computer  Program  Works
According  to Article 2 of the Software  Industry  Promotion  Act, the term “software”  means a collection  of
instructions  and commands  (including  audio or visual information,  etc.) that enables  equipment,  such as computers,
communications  apparatuses  and automation  equipment  and peripheral  equipment  to command,  control, input,
process,  save, output and interact,  and descriptions  used to prepare  them and other related data.
A computer  program  work is a generic  term for a computer  program  and a work of descriptive  language  of a program.
A computer  program  work includes  programming  language  (C, Java, etc.), protocol,  algorithm,  source code and object
code (compiled  source code), and © structure  and arrangement  method of the program.  Here, the source code,
object  code, program  structure  and arrangement  are protected by copyright,  but programming  languages,  protocols,
algorithms,  etc. for programming  are excluded  from the protection.  In other words, the product  of writing software  is
protected  by copyright,  but programming  languages,  protocols,  and algorithms  for writing  programs  are excluded  from
copyright  protection.
Software  is copyrighted  so that only the software  author has the right to use, copy, distribute,  and modify  the
software.  If the software  author gives someone  the right to perform certain actions, this is called a “license.”  The
software  license agreement  contains  detailed  regulations  based on the basic contents  of the purpose  of the contract,
the definition  clause, the establishment  of the license,  the term of the contract,  the storage  of records,  and royalties,
in order to clearly  set forth the criteria for settlement  in case of dispute.

Open source software  (OSS, Open Source  Software)  refers to software  in which anyone  can freely use/copy/distribute/
