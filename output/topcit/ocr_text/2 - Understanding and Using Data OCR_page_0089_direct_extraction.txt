ESSENCE
+ Temporary  table: A temporary  table that can store and process  data for each transaction  or session.
@ Considerations  when designing  a table
+ If the sum of the column  data length is more than 1 block size, vertical  split needs to be considered.
+ If the use frequency  of a specific  column  is extraordinarily  high, vertical  split needs to be considered.
+ If different  user groups use a specific  column  only, vertical  split needs to be considered.
+ When considering  vertical partitioning,  there should be no case in which a split table is processed  simultaneously  by
one transaction  or join operations  occur frequently.
O2 Data Type Design
Data are stored in a database  in various forms such as characters,  numbers, dates, and images. If a data type
is incorrectly  selected when designing  a database,  it makes the development  of an application  more difficult  or
deteriorates  performance.  Therefore,  it is very important  to carefully  determine  the data type or size in the database
design phase.
A) Character  data type
@ Fixed-length  character  type: A type of data for which as much space is allocated  and used as data are declared.
@ Variable-length  character  type: A type of data for which as much space is allocated  and used as data are actually
stored,
© Character  large object: A type of data that is designed  to be stored as large character  type data. As it is too big, the
actual type column is not stored in a database,  but stored outside  the table, and the table column stores the address
that references  the data location only. This type of data can be useful when storing large amounts  of text, such as a
book or publication.
B) Numeric  data type
@ Real type: A type of data that represents  real numbers  in floating  point and variable  point formats.
@ Integer  type: A type of data that represents  an integer  within the range of the maximum  size.
C) Binary  data type
@ Fixed-length  binary data type: A type of data that can store as much binary data as has been defined.
@ Variable-length  binary data type: A type of data that can be stored in the form of binary data by allocating  as much
space as the actual storage  size within the defined  size.
@ Binary large object: A type of data that can be stored in the form of one large binary set of data such as image, video,
and sound. Like CLOB, it is stored outside  the table, and a reference  address  is stored in the actual CLOB column.
D) Date data type
Date and time data type: A type of data that can be stored in the form of time, date, and time + date.
