@ Error correction
Error correction  methods  include a method in which the receiving  device requests  the sending  device to retransmit
the entire data, or the receiving  device  automatically  performs  a correction  using an error correction  code.
{Table 33) Error Correction  Methods
Correction Description
Single bit error + The principle  of error correction  is to locate the wrong bit, which is called a parity bit.
correction + ASCII code requires  a 3-bit redundancy  code.
Redundant  bit error + Amethod  of checking  the relationship  between  the number  of data bits and the number  of redundant
correction bits to calculate  the number  of redundant  bits required  to correct the number  of data bits given
Hamming  code + Amethod  to find the redundant  bit position  in Hamming  code.
Multi-bit  error + Amethod  of using the redundant  bit, which is calculated  by overlapping  a set of data bits, in order to
correction correct  the multi-bit  error
@ Automatic  repeat request  (ARQ)
ARQis  an algorithm  in which the receiving  side informs  the sending  side of the error, and the sending  side retransmits
the error frame to correct  the error. Typical ARQ methods  include stop-and-wait  ARQ, Go-back-N  ARQ, and adaptive
ARQ. Details  of each retransmission  algorithm  type are shown in the <Table 34> below.
(Table 34) ARQ Types
ARQ type Description
+ The transmitting  side transmits  one frame to the receiving  side, and the receiving  side transmits  an
Stop-and-wait  ARPeMERTEIBAe| ACK or NAC signal to the transmitting  side, depending  on the presence  of errors in the received frame.
+ The method  continuously  transmits  frames  to overcome  the disadvantage  of the transmission
Go-back-N  ARQ efficiency  of the stop-and-wait  ARQ. The transmitting  side assigns  a frame sequence  number  as
much as the window  size, and continuously  transmits  it to a certain unit.
. + The method  is similar  to Go-back-N  ARQ but retransmits  only the frame with an error.
Selective-repeat  ARQ . .
+ The transmission  and receipt  buffers  must be large enough
+ The method  detects  the error rate of the communication  line and dynamically  changes  and
transmits  the most appropriate  frame length
+ The method  combines  the FEC and REC.
Hybrid-ARQ + It maintains  the network  efficiency,  by performing  the FEC normally,  and improves  the reliability,  by
performing  the BEC when an error occurs.Adaptive  ARQ
