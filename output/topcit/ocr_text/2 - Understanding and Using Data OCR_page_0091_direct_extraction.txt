B) Creation  of the view
@ A view is created  from an existing  table using the CREATE  VIEW statement  ([Figure  37]).
CREATE  VIEW  View_name
[(column_name  [,column_name...])]
[WITH  ENCRYPTION]
AS select_statement  [WITH  CHECK  OPTION]
[Figure 37] View creation  syntax
@ WITH CHECK  OPTION
* This option is used to make all data modification  statements  executed  on the view comply  with the conditions  of
the SELECT  statement.
@ WITH ENCRYPTION
+ This option prevents  users from viewing  the text that creates  a view.
+ To decrypt,  the view must be deleted,  and a new view should be created.
@ Constraints
+ The user of the view should have the SELECT  privilege  for the entity used in the view definition.
+ The SELECT  INTO statement  cannot  be used.
+ Aview  ona temporary  table cannot  be created.
+ A trigger  or an index cannot  be created  for the view.
+ Up to 250 columns  can be referred  to.
C) Modifying  data with a view
@A view  does not have a separate  data copy.
@ An update  of the view always  affects  the original table.
@ Constraints
+ An update  of the view cannot  affect more than one original  table, and it can affect only one table.
+ Acolumn  that has a calculated  value, built-in  function,  or calculation  function  cannot  be updated  using a view.
+ Anerror  will occur if a view affects  a table that has a NOT NULL column.
+ A default  value should have been defined  or Null should be allowed  for the column  without  an input value.
D) Other  considerations
@ If a new column  is added to the original table after defining  the view, this column  will not appear  in the view.
@ To change  the definition  of a view itself, the existing  view should be deleted,  and the view should be defined  again.
© The view is not automatically  deleted  even if the original entity is deleted.  Therefore,  the view should be manually
deleted.
