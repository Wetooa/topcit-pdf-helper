@ Incremental  model
+ The incremental  model is useful when the system development  time needs to be reduced.  For example,  this
model is appropriate  when a system should be developed  by the date the customer  wants, even though not
all of the functions  can be developed  by that time. That is, the core parts are developed  first to make the
system  operable,  and then the rest of the functions  are implemented.
+ A system is developed  by extending  the functions  several times. The system  version in each phase runs
only a few limited functions,  and the later version includes  newly added functions  in addition  to those of the
previous  version.  Of course,  the final system  version is a complete  system into which all of the functions  are
incorporated.
+ This model is also useful when most of the requirements  are defined,  but improvements  can be made as time
goes by.
+ This model can be usefully  applied to reduce the risk of external  interfaces  (H/W and S/W) in the early phase
of development.
+ Both the V model and the VP model can be applied since the requirements  for each phase for development
of a function  expansion  are generally  clear.
@ Evolutionary  model
+ Like the incremental  model, the evolutionary  model is useful when the system  development  time needs to be
reduced.  However,  unlike the incremental  model, the development  phase for the entire system is reiterated
several times. Each system provides  all of the functions  to the user.
+ Next, changes  are identified  when a system is developed  and used, and then those changes  are reflected  in
the development  of the next system.
+ Changes  include changes  to the function,  changes  to the user interface,  and changes  to non-functional
items such as reliability  and performance  improvement,  etc. This model is suitable  when the overall system
specification  is not certain or when the product  should be continually  improved.
+ In practice,  this model is used in combination  with the incremental  model. That is, new functions  can be
added to a new system version, while the existing  functions  are improved.  A mixed model such as this has
the following  characteristics.
- Users can be trained about a system early on even though the system is not fully functional.
Users can familiarize  themselves  with the system and identify  improvements  necessary  for
practical  business,  because  they can use the system  after receiving  initial training.  By doing so, a
system  can be developed  that is needed  by practical  business.
- Also, competitiveness  can be improved  by reducing  the development  period and using the system
in the early stages.
- Since a system is developed  over time, unexpected  problems  with the system can be identified
and fixed early on.
- Or a system can be developed  by dividing  it by specialized  field. For example,  if the functions
need to be improved  from a text-based  user interface  to a graphic-based  user interface,  a
development  team specializing  in user interface  can implement  the project.
