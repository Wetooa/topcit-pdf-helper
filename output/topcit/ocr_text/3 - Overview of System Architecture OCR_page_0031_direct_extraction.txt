that houses the CPU and the main memory.  The mainframe  features  excellent  stability  and performance,  but it is
very expensive  because  an enterprise  made all the elements  from the CPU to OS, the development  language,  and
the application  programs,  The mainframe  began downsizing  gradually  in 1997 when the attention  to super Unix
servers, such as HP, Sun, and Silicon Graphics,  increased.  Downsizing  refers to replacing  a mainframe  server with a
super Unix server, While Unix servers  were generally  equipped  with a Power CPU, it is worth noting  that more mid- to
large-sized  servers  began featuring  Pentium  CPU in the server market  in 1997. It was around  this time that Windows
NT servers, using Intel CPU, were on the sharp rise. Twenty  years later, in 2017, x86 servers,  featuring  Intel CPU, are
dominating  the Unix server  market. Currently,  the server  market is divided into x86 servers and non-x86  servers.
Although  the market  is divided  into two major server  types in terms of sales,x86  servers  account  for more than 70%
when comparing  the number  of server  units sold.
This server has a stack structure.  The computer  hardware,  consisting  of a CPU, main memory,  and auxiliary  memory
is at the bottom.  An OS that abstracts  computer  hardware  and provides  services  to software  is located above it.
On top of the OS, middleware,  such as a webserver,  WAS, and DBMS server to support  the flexibility  of convenient
expansion,  as well as the reduction  of application  programs  and independence  of computer  hardware,  is located.
Application  programs  provide  services  to users using this middleware.

While some argue that an abacus used in calculations  in ancient  times is the origin of computers,  the Turing Machine,
devised by the English mathematician  Allen Turing in 1936, is generally  regarded  as the beginning  of modern
computers.  This Turing Machine  proved the mathematical  concepts  and calculation  processes.  Afterward,  ENIAC,
created in 1946, is known as the first programmable  general-purpose  computer.  Using 18,000 vacuum tubes, it
weighed  30 tons and was literally as large as a house. Later, EDSAC,  the first computer  that embedded  the program
