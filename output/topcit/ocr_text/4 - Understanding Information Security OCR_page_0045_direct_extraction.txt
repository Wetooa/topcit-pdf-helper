B) Access  control  policy
The system security  policy is the high-level  instructions  for designing  and managingthe  access control system.
In general, the policy is the expression  of the basic principles,  desired by the organization,  to protect  target
system  resources.  That is, the access  control principle  defines  the subject  (who), time (when), location  (where),
object (what), and behavior  (how) that can be accepted  or refused. The access  control principle,  which limits
the scope of access,  can be divided into the following  two basic policies:
@® Minimum  privilege  policy
This policy is called the “need-to-know’  policy. System  subjects  should use the minimum  amount  of information
that is needed for their activities.  This policy has the effect of applying  strong control over object access.
However,  sometimes  this policy may impose  excessive  useless  limitations  on the legitimate  subject.
@ Maximum  privilege  policy
This policy is based on the principle  of maximum  availability  that is applied to increase  the benefits  of data
sharing.  That is, this policy can be effectively  applied to the case when no special protection  is needed,  due to
the high reliability  of data exchange  with the user.
C) Types of access  control policies
This policy is designed  to implement  an access control system that only allows authorized  users to access
information  resources.
Representative  access control policies include mandatory  access control, a discretionary  access control policy,
and a role-based  access  control policy.
@ Mandatory  Access  Control  (MAC)
A security  level is given to the subject and a security label is given to the object. Then, it is determined
whether  the subject in question  can access the object, according  to the predetermined  rule. This policy is
mainly used for military purposes.  A strong security  system can be maintained,  but its management  efficiency
is deteriorated,
