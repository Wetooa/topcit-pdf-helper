+ Preview  for practical  business Do we need to maintain  software?
Maintenance  costs account  for 60% of the entire software  process cost, of which 60% is spent on
functional  enhancement.  Of the remaining  40%, 17% is spent on error correction,  18% on maintaining
adaptability  to support  other platforms,  and 5% on refactoring.

Maintenance  - 60%
Software  maintenance  is the continuous  modification  and supplementation  of fully developed
software that is currently  in use, for the purpose  of adapting  it to changes  in the environment,
correcting  errors, and improving  its performance.  To reduce maintenance,  the system must be
properly  developed  so that it can flexibly  adapt to environmental  changes.
After its development,  software  will be continuously  modified  and supplemented  from the beginning
of its use until its final disuse for various  reasons.  Software  is a system that is directly  connected  to a
person's  consciousness  or behavior.
Therefore,  if the software  is not well maintained,  it will lose its vitality, that is, it will no longer be fit
for use. Therefore,  software  maintenance  is more important  than initial development,  and requires
more effort and cost.
