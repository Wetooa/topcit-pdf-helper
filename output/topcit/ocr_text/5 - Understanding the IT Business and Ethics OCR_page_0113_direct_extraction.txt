With the aim of improving  the quality of patent administration  and laying the
foundations  for customer-oriented  administrative  services,  the Korean Intellectual
Property  Office (KIPO) declared  its core vision of ‘Promoting  Technology  Innovation
Korean  Intellectual  and Establishing  an Environment  Conducive  to Innovation  by Effectively  Protecting
Property  Office nq Promoting  the Use of Intellectual  Property’ and its mission of  ‘Becoming  an
Intellectual  Property  Powerhouse  through  the Innovation  of Patent  Administration’.  Based on this vision and
mission statement,  the patent office developed  five strategic  objectives,  taking into account  the unique
nature of public institutions  and the two conflicting  interests  of public benefit and financial  profit. In 2005,
the patent  office created  the BSC system,  which links the performance  targets  of individual  employees  to
the five strategic  objectives  of KIPO.
The Korean Intellectual  Property  Office developed  the BSC system in three phases, as follows. In the Ist
phase (second  half of 2004), KIPO established  the performance  management  model for each department.
It also established  its mission,  vision, and strategic  goals, and then derived  the key success  factors  (19) and
the key performance  indicators  (32) for realizing  those goals.
Thus the strategic  framework  of the office was completed  by November  26, 2004. Based on this strategic
framework,  and in alignment  with its strategic  goals, the office announced  the performance  goals, key
success  factors  and key performance  indicators  that each department/bureau  must pursue,  on December
21, 2004. These factors  and indicators  were the core areas of the one-year  job performance  agreements
signed between  the commissioner  and the bureau/department  heads, and between  the bureau/department
heads and the team managers,  on December  28, 2004.
In the 2nd phase (first half of 2005), the organization-level  BSC design was followed  by the individual-level
performance  management  model design. The organizational  performance  indicators were distributed  to
individual  employees,  who were asked to align organization-level  performance  with individual  performance
by reflecting  the organization's  performance  score in the individual  performance  score. By April 30, 2005, an
individual  performance  and competency  evaluation  system had been established  through  which employees
could be motivated  to meet their job goals. At the same time, as part of its effort to introduce  a more
performance-centered  HR policy, the office announced  a new plan in which the result of each individual
employee's  performance  evaluation  would be more closely  linked to the compensation  system.
In the 3rd phase, deployment  of the information  system began on April 1, 2005, and was completed  by the
end of June. Concurrently,  the information  system construction  work was carried out from April 1, 2005 and
completed  at the end of June. The performance  management  system was implemented  using the best
solution  so as to enable the office to manage  performance  as a whole. A strategic  operational  system was
also put in place to monitor  the execution  of the strategies  at all times, and thereby  permit the office to
respond  quickly.
