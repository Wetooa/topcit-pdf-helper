common  modules  that are additionally  required  to apply encryption,  as well as application  logic that needs to
be changed  should be analyzed.  Then, the application  module  that needs to be optimized  should be selected.
© Testing  database  encryption
Business  tests, such as applications,  are conducted  in this phase, after applying  encryption,  by creating the
same test environment  as the database  application  operating  environment.  The problems  that can occur when
migrating  to an operating  environment,  should be identified  by running  tests. Migration  to the operational
environment  should be prepared  by resolving  all issues. All applications  and all query statements  should be
tested.
@® Applying  and monitoring  database  encryption
Database  application  security  should be applied to the operating  environment  in this phase, by synthesizing
the items verified in the test phase. Encryption  should be applied to data, and source code that was
modified  in the test and verification  phase, and optimized  query statements  should be reflected.  Issues that
were identified  in the test phase should be resolved  and applied to the operating  environment.  It should
be continuously  monitored  and checked  whether  any errors occur in the applied applications  and query
statements,  and whether  applications  are running  properly.
04 Database  encryption  key management
A) Type of database  encryption  keys
If the encryption/decryption  key is leaked, the encryption  is not effective.  Therefore,  the encryption  key should
be redundant  (encryption/decryption  key and the master  key), according  to the principle  of key redundancy,  so
that only authorized  persons  can access it.
<Table 32> Database  encryption  key
Type Description
Encryption/decryption  key A key used to encrypt  data, and to decrypt  the already  encrypted  data.
Master  key A key used to store and distribute  the encryption  and decryption  key after encryption.
B) Management  methods  by encryption  key lifecycle
@ Key generation  stage
An encryption/decryption  key should be generated  using a safe random number  generator,  and an algorithm
with proven stability  should be used for the encryption  key derived  from user input.
@ Key distribution  stage
Security  should be maintained  when distributing  keys, by encrypting  the encryption  keys using an asymmetric
key cipher algorithm,  so that only the authorized  person can access  the keys.
