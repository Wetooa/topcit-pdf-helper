A data model that is as complex  as a maze can ruin a project.  A complex  maze, like the one shown below
left, means that countless  trials and errors will be required  to find a fast path. Such a data model does
not consider  business  characteristics  and physical  characteristics.  As a result, the model has to undergo
countless  trials and errors to obtain the desired  result because  the path to the data is not clear. Also, even
if the same number  of paths is passed,  join operations  are generated  by checking  additional  conditions
only, without  passing  through  the optimized  path. In the end, multiple  join operations  further  degrade
performance.
In addition,  if an entity is expressed  unnecessarily  in large numbers,  data are processed  inefficiently  because
an SQL statement  should read several tables, while the intended  result can be obtained  by reading  and
processing  data from one table alone.

If we check the data only, the two kinds of problems  that arise due to increased  data can be summarized
as follows:
- Increased  data — Data duplication  > Problems  occur in data consistency.
- Increased  data — Fall in SQL response  speed — Performance  declines.
These two problems  become  more important  as the number  of data grows, and can be solved by
optimizing  data modeling,  which is the ideal way to fundamentally  resolve the problem.  However,  data
modeling  cannot  be performed  at any time. Therefore,  when data modeling  is performed  again, it should be
optimized  for efficiently  processing  data.
