@® Phase of secure SDLC requirement  definition
A phase that defines security  objectives,  according  to the characteristics  of the project and software,  and
analyzes  security  weakness  and impact, according  to the potential  threat. Security  requirements  for software
development  are derived in this phase.
@ Secure SDLC analysis/design  phase
A phase that designs  security  architecture  and security  requirements  in the entire architecture  design process.
Developer  training  is implemented,  and security  test plans are designed  in this phase in order to build a safe
security  system.
© Secure  SDLC coding  phase
Coding rules are defined by checking  the weaknesses  and strengths  of the used programming  language  from
a security  perspective.  The static unit test of the developed  code is conducted,  and compliance  with the
predefined  secure coding rules are verified.  When a commercial  package  is used, security  vulnerability  content
and action details found in the package  are checked.
® Secure  SDLC testing  phase
A dynamic  unit test is conducted  on the developed  program,  and the usability  of the security  applied
application  is tested. Matters  to improve  security  are derived and applied, by checking  the vulnerability  of the
infrastructure  and application  program,  independently  of the system.
@® Secure  SDLC maintenance  phase
When modifying  codes, according  to the software  change management  procedure,  impact on security  is
evaluated,  vulnerabilities  are checked  periodically,  and matters  to improve  security  are derived  and applied.

@® Secure  coding  techniques  for responding  to the SQL injection  attack
+ Attack overview
If the validity  of the data entered in the web application  program,  linked with the database,  is not verified,  an
attacker  can read or  manipulate  information  from the database  by inserting  an SQL statement  into the input
form and URL field. The SQL injection  attack refers to this security  vulnerability,
