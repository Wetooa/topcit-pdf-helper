@ The necessity  for the EDW
f an enterprise  wishes to maintain  uniformity  of viewpoint  across its entire organization,  it must consolidate  the
information  that it possesses  and any external  information  it needs from an enterprise-wide  perspective  and keep it
as the master  information.
n today’s rapidly changing  business  environment,  enterprises  have to extract enterprise-perspective  data by
conducting  diverse data analyses  for users in diverse sectors. This is because  enterprises  need to have sufficient
orecasting  capability  for making  strategic choices  and responding  to changing  user requirements  brought  about by
changes  in the business  environment.  Enterprises  also have to integrate  their information  resources  and reorganize
heir management  system  as part of redesigning  their system  to prevent  data duplication.
@ Characteristics  of the EDW
The EDW was created  with a clear purpose  for its use. The concept  explains  a very import characteristic  of the EDW,
amely, that of being topic-centered.  Upon adopting  the EDW, critical data within and outside  the company  become
concentrated  and consolidated  in one place; and data are loaded and used in a time-based  order. Once stored, data
will not be destroyed  or changed  unless there is a particular  reason for doing so. These characteristics  of the EDW are
described  in detail as follows.5
<Table  44> Characteristics  of the EDW
Characteristics Description
+ Structures  the system  around  the topic of processing  the data to be analyzed  like a dailySubject-Oriented
transaction.
+ Extracts  and integrates  the internal  and external  data of an enterprise.
Integrated + For different  formats  of data expression,  when extracting  data, the process is managed  so
that data can be expressed  in a uniform  format.
+ While preserving  the accuracy  of the data for a certain period of time, time elements  like the
Time Variant day, week, and month are properly reflected.
+ To maintain  consistency  of analysis,  properties  do not change  when they have been
Non-volatile recorded properly
+ The stored data exist as read-only,  and will not be deleted  unless  there are special rules or
events  requiring  their deletion.
@ Configuration  of the EDW
The EDW is configured  so that the work support  system collects, transforms  and loads data during operations,
analyzes  data that meet the given requirements,  and visualizes  them in such a way that they will be of assistance
when making  decisions.  From a macro perspective,  all these processes  are referred  to as the EDW, and from a
microscopic  point of view, the repository  for storing  data is referred  to as the EDW.
