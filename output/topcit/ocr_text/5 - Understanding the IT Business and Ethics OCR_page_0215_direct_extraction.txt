@ Acquisition  of Industrial  Property  Rights
Industrial  property  rights are acquired  by registering  with the Korean  Intellectual  Property  Office.
The first-to-file  rule applies to registration,  and since it is protected  only in the country  in which the registration  is
made, the rights are recognized  only when a separate  application  is made in each country  (Article 38 of the Patent
Act, Article 8 of the Utility Model Act, Article 16 of the Design Act, and Article  9 of the Trademark  Act).
Industrial  property  rights grant the creator  an exclusive  right for a certain period of time, after  which anyone  can use
it, in order to seek technological  progress  and industrial  development.
