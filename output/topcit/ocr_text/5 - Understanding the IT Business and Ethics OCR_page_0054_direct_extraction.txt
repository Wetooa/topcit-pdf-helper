>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
When a company  is contemplating  the deployment  of an IT business,  the decision  to develop  it in-house  or
outsource  its development  has always  been a difficult  decision  to make from a corporate  perspective.
It is also difficult  to choose  whether  to use package  products  or to develop  systems  from scratch  when the
decision  is made to outsource  IT.
For these reasons,  whenever  a company  pursues  the deployment  of an IT business,  it has to make an in-
depth study of what method  would enable the company  to respond  actively  to changes  in the environment
and be of help to the continued  existence  and development  of the IT business.
There is a growing  awareness  that, in order to strengthen  corporate  competitiveness,  specific procedures
must be developed  for the adoption  of an IT business; and that, at the end of its deployment,  comes the
building  of the information  system.  As a result, for the adoption  of an IT business  to produce  the maximum
effect, a company  must set up an organizational  structure and process  for the many different  standards
involved  in the building  and operation  of the information  system.
