Software  Development )
However,  the software  version of each customer  varied as time went by. In the end, the development
team was unable to track the customers’  requirements  and software  versions.  The source code was
patched  frequently,  and bugs that did not exist before began to appear  one by one. The team had to
perform  tedious  debugging  for each source code line almost every day.
If they had known and utilized such concepts  as branching  and merging  of configuration  management,
baseline,  baseline  promotion,  change tracking,  and configuration  audit, they would not have struggled  with
new bugs that appeared  every day by systematically  responding  to requests  for changes.
Further  efforts are required  to fully understand  and utilize these concepts,  but the effect is certainly  worth it.
If you have ever managed  to complete  a software  development  project without configuration
management,  you must be very lucky. However,  | think all of us must have experienced  this difficulty
at least once or twice. What if Mr Ko’s team had only started the project after establishing  a software
development  process, even though it was simple, and established  a configuration  management  plan
according  to the situation?  It is quite probable  that a ridiculous  thing like this would never have happened.
In conclusion,  configuration  management  surely helps software  development.  It takes more activities
to understand  and utilize those concepts,  but the effect is certainly  more than that.

01 Overview  of Software  Configuration  Management
A) Definition  of software  configuration  management
Software  configuration  management  (SCM) is a series of activities  developed  to manage  software  changes
during the software  development  process.  Software  configuration  management  is the task of finding and
controlling  the causes of software  changes,  checking  that software  has been properly  changed,  and notifying
the relevant  person of the result. It is applied to all stages of software  development  and is performed  during
the maintenance  phase as well as the development  phase so as to reduce the overall cost of software
development  and guarantee  the minimization  of risk factors  during the development  process.
