01 Concept  and Process  of Testing
A) Concept  of testing
Testing is a method of checking  or confirming  that the operation,  performance  and stability  of an application
or system satisfies  the demands  of the user or customer,  by identifying  or detecting  defects  or faults etc. The
general  principles  of testing  are as follows.
@ Testing  shows the presence  of defects
Testing  activity is designed  to reveal the presence  of defects. However,  it is almost impossible  to prove that
software  has no defects.
@ Exhaustive  testing  is not possible
Even a very simple program  cannot  be tested for all cases.
© Testing  should start during the initial stages of development
If tested early, the development  period can be reduced and defect prevention  activities  can be performed,
eventually  resulting  in a reduction  of costs.
@ Pesticide  paradox
The repetitive  use of the same pesticide  mixes to eradicate  insects will over time lead to the insects
developing  resistance  to the pesticide,  thus rendering  the pesticides  ineffective.  The same applies to software
testing. If the same set of repetitive  tests is conducted,  the method will be totally ineffective  in discovering
new defects.
© Testing  is context  dependent
The approach  as well as the methodology  and severity  differ for each field.
© Absence  of error - fallacy
Finding  and fixing defects  will be of no help whatsoever  if the ‘system  build’ is unusable  and does not fulfill the
user's needs and requirements.
B) Testing  process
Testing should be coordinated  and managed  by emphasizing  a process  comprising  various components.  The
table below shows the main activities  of the process  concerned.
