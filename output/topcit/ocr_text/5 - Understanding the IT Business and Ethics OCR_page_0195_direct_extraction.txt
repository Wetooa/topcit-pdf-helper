@ The EU General  Data Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)
The GDPR is a unified rule created  by the European  Parliament  to strengthen  the privacy  of European  citizens.
It was promulgated  by the European  Parliament  in 2016 (Regulation  (EU) 2016/679),  and after a grace period of about
two years, it took effect in each EU member  state from May 25, 2018. When using data of EU citizens,  you must
comply  with the GDPR. For example,  even if there is no business  establishment  in Europe,  any company  that provides
goods and services  to residents  of the European  Union (EU) must comply with the regulations  of the GDPR. In
addition,  when a company  violates  the right of personal  information,  it is required to notify the supervisory  authority
within 72 hours.
The main contents  of the GDPR are the expansion  of the application  of personal  information  processing  (for all
companies  that process  personal  information),  enhancing  the rights of data subjects, strengthening  the responsibility
of data controllers,  prohibiting  the transfer  of personal  information  abroad in principle,  and taking measures  to protect
information  from the processing  design stage when processing  personal  information.
In GDPR, the three entities  involved  in the process  of processing  personal  information  are defined  as the data subject,
the controller  and the processor.

information  created  by him/her.

to the type thereof  determines  the purpose  of processing,  and is in charge of processing  means. Even if the data is
the same, the controllers  can be differentiated  if the purpose  of processing  is different.
+ Processor:  Refers to an individual,  corporation,  or public institution  entrusted  with processing  personal  information
on behalf  of the controller, and processes  personal  information  as directed  by the controller,
