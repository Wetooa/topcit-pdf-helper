Overview  of System Architecture )
When classifying routing protocols,  based on AS, the routing protocol  within the AS is called the inter gateway
protocol  (IGP). The leading IGP includes  the routing information  protocol  (RIP), using a distance  vector routing
algorithm,  and the open shortest  path first (OSPF),  using a link-state  routing  algorithm.  The routing  protocol  between
AS is called the exterior  gateway  protocol  (EGP). The leading  EGP is the border  gateway  protocol  (BGP) that uses a
path-vector  routing  algorithm.
D) Routing  protocol  type
The routing protocol includes  RIP, which uses the distance-vector  routing  algorithm  and delivers  the routing  table
information  every 30 seconds  through  broadcasting,  IGRP. which improves  some of the RIP problems  by reflecting  the
network  state (bandwidth,  delay time, load, etc.), OSPF, which uses the link-state  routing  algorithm,  and BGP, which
connects  between  AS. <Table 50> shows  the details  of each protocol.
Table 50) Routing Protocol  Types
Protocol Description
+ RIP uses the distance-vector  routing  algorithm  and delivers  the routing  table information  every 30 seconds
RIP through  broadcasting.
(RFC 1058) + The number  of hops is limited (up to 16hop),  VLSM is not supported,  and load balance  is not available.
+ It does not reflect  the network  state (bandwidth,  delay time, load, etc.).
+ IGRP enhances  some of the problems  of RIP.
IGRP + It reflects  the network  state (bandwidth,  delay time, load, etc.).
+ The number  of hops is increased  (up to 255 hops), VLSM is not supported,  and load balance  is available.
+ OSPF uses the link-state  routing  algorithm.ae  Rec | * Information  on the occurrence  of changes, such as user-specified  routes, the most economical  routes, and
n 47) multiple  routes, spreads  faster than RIP
+ Topology  information  remains  the same across all routers,  VLSM, and load balancing.
BGP + EGP method  that connects  AS and the interconnection  of large networks
(RFC 4271) + Uses the TCP technique,  based on the path-vector  routing
06 IPv4 Overview
A) What is an IPv4 (Internet  Protocol  Version  4) address?
The IPv4 address  is the 32-bit address  used on the IP layer, as shown in [Figure 123]. It is an identifier  that makes the
router or host connection  to the Internet  unique and universal.
