The /etc/profile  file is a login script for setting  the default  use environment  of all the log-in users. If the access
right of the /etc/profile  is incorrectly  set, unauthorized  users can cause a breach incident  by changing  the user
environment,  using various methods.  Therefore, remove  the writing privilege  for the /etc/profile  from the users,
other than the root (bin).
+ How to remove  other users’ privileges  of the /etc/profile  file:
# Is -al /etc/profile
# chown root /etc/profile
# chmod o-w /etc/profile
@ Setting  umask
To check the umask setting details of the current user, run the “umask”  command  at the command  prompt.
The umask value should be set to “027” or “022”. If the umask value is set to “027”,  a file is created with the
access rights of “rw-r-----  ” and if the umask value is set to “022”, a file is created with the access rights of
“rw-r--r--”.  Therefore,  the umask value should be set to “022” so as not to allow unnecessary  access.
+ How to set umask:
In SUN, uncomment  the UMASK option in the /etc/default/login  file and set it to 022. For other UNIX
operating  systems,  add “Umask  022’ in the profile.
E) Service  security
@® Stopping  unnecessary  services
If unnecessary  service ports are open, it can cause security  vulnerability,  Therefore, unused services  should be
removed.  <Table 34> shows  a list of daemon  services  and service  ports that should be checked  for stopping.
