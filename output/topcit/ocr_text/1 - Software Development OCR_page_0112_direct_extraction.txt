Projects  fail mostly because  of inappropriate  requirements  management.
According  to data from Standish  Group, a global market  research  organization,  50% of IT project
failures in overseas  countries  are related to requirements  management,  and 70-80%  of the total
project cost is caused by the failure of requirements  management.  The above data also apply to
domestic  projects.  The main causes  of these results can be summarized  as follows.
- Inadequate  definition  of requirements/insufficient  communication:  Insufficient  understanding  of
the requirements  in the early development  process due to limited resources  and timelines,  and
incomplete  dialogue  between  stakeholders.
- Lack of change management:  When changing  the customers’  requirements  or the development
deliverables,  its impact  and relevancy  are not considered.
