[Figure  2] 3-level database  architecture
To understand  data independence,  it is helpful to understand  the background  to the introduction  of the concept
of data independence.  The opposite  of data independence  can be defined as data dependency.  Here, the subject
of dependency  generally  refers to an application  program.  An application  is the interface  object which interacts
with users and handles  the user requirements.  It can be said that data dependency  has the purpose  of reducing
continuously  increasing  maintenance  costs, data complexity,  and the number  of duplicated  data. The concept  of
data independence  was also introduced  to maintain  independence  between  the screen and the database  against  the
users’ constantly  evolving  requirements.
It can be said that data independence  is a three-schema  architecture,  which was proposed  by the special
subcommittee  of the X3 committee  under the American  Standards  Institute  (ANSI) for the DBMS and its interfaces,
The main purpose  of this three-schema  architecture  was to reduce interference  in changes,  by separating  the
user's view of the database  from the view by which the database  is actually  expressed.  When data independence  is
secured,  the independence  of each view can be maintained,  data can be changed  without  affecting  the view by layer,
and different  DDL (data definition  language)  and DML (data manipulation  language)  can be provided  according  to the
schema  by phase.
@ 3-level database  architecture  of ANSI-SPARC
The data independence  model, which is based on the 3-level database  architecture  proposed  by ANSI/SPARC,
presents  a model composed  of an external  phase, a conceptual  phase, and an internal  phase, none of which interferes
with the others.
