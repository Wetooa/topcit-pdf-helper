@ Boyce-Codd  normalization  ([Figure  32])
+ It is assumed  that there is a functional  dependency  relationship  between  (professor,  course name) — (text material
name), (text material  name) — (course  name) in the table on the left.
+ In this case, the table on the left is not the Boyce-Codd  normal  form.
+ The reason is that there is functional  dependency  (text material  name) — (course  name) wherein  the determinant  is
not a candidate  key,
+ The Boyce-Codd  normal form table is derived  by dividing  the un-normalized  table into two tables, as shown on the
right.

04 Database  Design  in Which Normalization  is Applied - (4th Normalization)
A) Concept  of the fourth normalization
The fourth normalization  is the process  of removing  more than two multi-valued  dependencies  (MVD) if they occur in
one relation.
B) Characteristics  of the fourth normalization
@ The fourth normalization  is possible  only when there is a semantic  association  constraint  between  attributes.
@ It is established  when all attributes  are primary  identifiers.  (Primary  key)
© Multi-valued  dependency  can be established  when there are three or more associated  attributes.
@ It corresponds  to normalization  by semantic  association,  not by the functional  dependency  relationship.
@© When there are three attributes,  A, B, and C, there is a semantic  relationship  as follows. However,  an anomaly  occurs
when creating  a table using these attributes.
+ Relationship  between  A and B: A and  B are related.
+ Relationship  between  A and C: A and C are related.
+ Relationship  between  C and B: C and B are not related.
