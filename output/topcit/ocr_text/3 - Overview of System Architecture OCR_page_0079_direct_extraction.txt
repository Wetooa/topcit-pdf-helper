Each processing  unit in the MISD parallel computing  architecture  runs different  instructions  and processes  the same
data. The pipeline  architecture  is an example.  It is not a widely used architecture.
@ Multiple  instruction  streams  - multiple  data stream,  Multiple  Instruction  Stream  Multiple  Data Stream (MIMD)
In a MIMD structure,  multiple  processors  process different  programs  and different  data, and most parallel computers
fall into this category.  It can be classified  into a shared memory  model and a distributed  memory  model, depending  on
how it uses the memory.  According  to the degree of data interaction,  the shared memory  model is called a tightly-
coupled  system,  and the distributed  memory  model is classified  as a loosely-coupled  system.

@ Symmetric  multiprocessor  (SMP)
SMP is a tightly-coupled  system in which all processors  use the main memory  as the shared memory.  It is easy
to program  since the data transfer  can use shared memory.  On the other hand, it has poor scalability  and may
experience  a bus bottleneck,  since it uses an internal  bus to access the main memory  and share the data.
