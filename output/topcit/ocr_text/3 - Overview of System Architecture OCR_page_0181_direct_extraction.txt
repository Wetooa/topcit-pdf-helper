* Practical  preview Operating  path of transport  layer protocols
The transport  layer protocols  operate  between  the computer  of user A, and the webserver  myservercom
that requests  data, i.e., end-to-end  service. Data packets  are delivered  through many hops between  a
client and a server. The nodes, positioned  between  the terminals,  such as the wired/Wireless  routers,  are not
involved  in the transport  layer protocol  operation.  TCP [1], UDP [2], and SCTP [3] are the leading  transport

01 Concept  of Transport  Layer Protocol
The transport  layer protocol transmits  application  data between  end-point  hosts. The server application  running  on
the server side receives  a request  from the client side, processes  it, and sends a response  to the client. On the client
side, a user selects  an application  to receive  the service the user wants, makes a request  to the server, and displays
the response  to the user. Applications  that traditionally  use networks,  operate in a client-server  structure,  and the
lowest  protocol,  connecting  the client application  and the server application,  is the transport  layer protocol.
Transport  layer protocols  that have been widely used are TCP (Transmission  Control Protocol)  [1] and UDP (User
Datagram  Protocol)  [2]. SCTP (Stream  Control Transmission  Protocol)  [3], which combines  the advantages  of TCP
and UDP is a new protocol introduced  after 2000. This chapter  focuses  on TCP and UDP which are currently  widely
used.
