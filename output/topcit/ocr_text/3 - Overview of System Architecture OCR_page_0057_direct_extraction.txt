C) Factors  that affect the virtual memory  unit performance
+ Locality:  A tendency  to intensively  refer to only some pages while a process  is running. It is divided into temporal
locality  and spatial locality.
+ Working  Set: A set of frequently  referred  to page lists for a certain  period to execute  a process  efficiently.  It reduces
page absence  and page replacement  by placing  the frequently  referred  to working  sets in the main memory.
+ Thrashing:  A phenomenon  in which the CPU utilization  rate decreases  because  page replacement  takes longer than
the processing  time. The degree  of multi-programming  is reduced,  the CPU utilization  rate is increased,  or a working
set is used to prevent  thrashing.
0? File System
A) Understanding  of file system
A file system stores related data to find and access  the OS data and programs  quickly. It is a directory  structure  that
provides  information  on an aggregation  of files and all files in the system.
@® Concept  of file
It is a set of data with a name and stored in an auxiliary  memory  unit, such as a disk or tape. The OS maps files
to physical devices. In other words, when the OS writes a program  or data to a file, it is permanently  stored in a
nonvolatile  physical  device.
@ File attributes
Files have several properties  to enable the ability to identify  and manage  them. The most common  is the file name,
which is expressed  as a single string. A process  or user can independently  create and access  files using the file name
attribute.  The types of file attributes  are described  as follows:
+ Name: Should be maintained  in a legible form by users.
+ Location:  Points to the device and location  of the file and includes  the directory  path.
+ Size: Includes  the current  file size (in bytes, words,  or blocks) and the maximum  allowable  size.
+ Protection:  Controls  who can read, write, or run the file.
+ Time, date, and user identification:  Include the data related to the creation  time, recent information,  and recent
usage.
B) Concept  of directory
A directory  is a logical structure  to manage  tens of thousands  of files managed  by a file system,  and can be the total
size of gigabytes  or terabytes.  It records  the information  about all files. The following  actions are performed  on a
directory:
+ File search:  A user can search  a file from the directory  structure.
+ File creation:  A new file is created  and added to the directory.
+ File delete: Unneeded  files are removed  from the file.
+ Directory  list: Lists files in a directory  and shows the directory  item.
