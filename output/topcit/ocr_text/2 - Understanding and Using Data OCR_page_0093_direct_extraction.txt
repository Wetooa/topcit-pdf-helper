@ Partitioning  transparency
+ Partitioning  transparency  informs  users how the global schema  has been split.
+ Users do not have to know how the global schema  has been split because  the global query entered  by the user is
converted  into several  fragment  queries.
+ Vertical  partitioning  splits a relation  into relations  made up of a subset  of attributes.
+ Horizontal  partitioning  splits a relation  into relations  made up of a subset  of tuples.
@ Location  transparency
+ Location  transparency  means that users or applications  do not need to know the physical location of data in a
distributed  database.
+ That is, users should be able to access data using the same command  regardless  of the location of data or the
input system.
@© Replication  transparency
+ Replication  transparency  means that users should not need to know which data are redundant  or where the
redundant  data are stored.
+ That is, users should be able to think that they are using logically  unique data.
© Failure  transparency
+ Failure transparency  means that data integrity  should be guaranteed  even if a failure occurs in each distributed
computer  system  or network.
+ The distributed  database  should maintain  the atomicity  of transactions  regardless  of a component  failure.
@ Concurrency  transparency
* Concurrency  transparency  means that the consistency  of the results is maintained  even though multiple
transactions  are executed  at the same time.
+ To maintain  the consistency  of distributed  transactions,  the distributed  database  management  system mainly uses
locking  and timestamp  methods.
