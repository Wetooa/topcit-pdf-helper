@ Electronic  signature  and encryption  in PKI
{Figure 20] describes  the process  for user authentication  and message  confidentiality,  and <Table 11>
describes  the main operation  steps of the sender and receiver  in the PKI environmentwhich  is when both the
sender and the receiver  operate  the public certificate  encryption  system. The session key in [Figure 21] is a
one-time  secret key, generated  by the sender, to apply the secret key system to the message.  The sender
encrypts  this key, using the public key of the receiverto  safely transmit  it. This encrypted  session  key is called
an electronic  envelope.

Item Order Description
Phase 1 | Creating  a message  digest  by applying  a hash algorithm  to the original message
Encrypting  the created  message  digest, with the sender's  private key, by applying  a public keyPhase 2 ; . -Sender cryptographic  algorithm  (generating  an electronic  signature)
Phase 3_ | Encrypting  the original message,  with a session  key, by applying  the private key cryptographic  algorithm
Phase 4 | Encrypting  the session  key used for encryption,  with the receiver's  public key (e-envelope)
Generating  a message  digest, by decrypting  a document  that is electronically  signed with the sender's
public key
Phase 2 | Extracting  the session  key, by decrypting  the encrypted  session  key, with the receiver's  private  key
Phase 3. | Decrypting  the encrypted  original  text using the extracted  session  key
