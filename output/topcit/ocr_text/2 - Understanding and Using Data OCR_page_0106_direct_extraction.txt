(OML).

B) Changes  in SQL and the characteristics  of SQL3
@ Changes  in SQL
SQL was developed  by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlain  and F. Raymond  Boyce in the early 1970s, and its
standards  have been changed  periodically  by the ANSI, as follows.

Year Name Alias Characteristics
1986 SQL SQ-86 First SQL standard
. Adopted  a major revision  (ISO9075)  FIPS 127-2.
es sQ2 SQis2 Relational  database
. Object-oriented  database
rep sas SQL1999 Added the regular expression,  recursive  query, trigger, etc.
2003 sala SQL-2003 XML-related  characteristics,  Window  functions,  standardized  sequences,  and a
SQI-2006 column that has an automatically  generated  value
In progress  | SQL/NM Consistent  access  to the metadata  registry
@ Characteristics  of SQL3
The object-oriented  characteristics  of SQL3 can be seen as the common  characteristics  of the object relational
DBMS..
