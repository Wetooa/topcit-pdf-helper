Overview  of System  Architecture
>> Recent  trends and issues
Communication  is established  by transferring  data through  electrical  or optical signals  over physical  media.
In the OSI 7 hierarchy,  the physical  layer is at the bottom,  and one can understand  the mechanisms  at the
lower-level  network  by learning  the media and standards  for this physical  layer. Moreover,  it is necessary  to
understand  the datalink  layer that connects  the physical  media and standards  with the upper layers, and to
further  learn the media access  control method  and the logical link control method.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain the sub-layer  (datalink  control and media access  control) of the datalink  layer,
2. To be able to explain the error detection  on the datalink  layer and error correction  techniques,
