03 Database  Design in Which Normalization  is Applied (1st, 2nd, 3rd,
Boyce-Codd)
The table derived by normalization  is called the “normal  form” table. The first normal  form (INF), second normal  form
(2NF), third normal form (3NF), Boyce-Codd  normal form (BCNF), fourth normal form (4NF), and fifth normal form
(5NF) have been introduced  in both the academic  world and practical  business.  In particular,  it is known that the third
normal  form and the Boyce-Codd  normal form are frequently  utilized.

B) Example  of normalization
@ First normalization  ([Figure  29])
+ The table on the left is an un-normalized  table, because  the “Courses”  field does not have atomic  values.
+ The first normal  form table, shown in the table on the right, can be derived by decomposing  the attribute  “Courses”
