@® Concept  of thread
A thread is a basic unit for using a CPU and is all called a lightweight  process.  As shown in [Figure 19], a process
generally  has one or more threads.  A thread shares the memory  unit, such as codes, data, and files, and creates
its own register and stack. While processes  use more CPU time than threads  for context  exchange,  threads  can
exchange  context  more economically  because  threads  share the memory  unit.

[Figure 19] Relationship  between  Thread  and Process
@ Multi-thread
As shown in [Figure  20], a single-thread  process  is a case in which a thread exists for a process,  and a process,  having
multiple  threads,  is called a multi-threaded  process.  A thread operates  with the status of “ready”, “blocked”,  “running”,
and “terminated”.  A CPU can occupy  only one thread at a time. In other words, only one thread runs at a time, and the
status of the other threads  is “blocked.”  When a thread is blocked,  other threads  can run. There are certain benefits
to using multi-threads.
