@ Overhead  Cost and Royalty
Overhead  cost is indirect expenses’  incurred in the areas of planning,  management,  and general affairs for the
administrative operation  of the software  developer.  Usually, it is calculated  as 110 to 120% of the direct labor
cost. Royalty  is an amount  paid in exchange  for the use and accumulation  of technology  developed  and owned
by the software  developer,  and it is calculated  as 20 to 40% of the sum of direct labor cost plus overhead
cost?
@ Direct Cost
Direct cost refers to expenses  directly required  for software  development,  such as royalties  for computer
system or software  tools, software,  professional  expenses,  travel expenses,  and materials  costs, etc. directly
incurred  for the software  development  project.
In the field of private projects,  the man month calculation  is used to calculate  project development  cost,
and also for mutual verification  interchangeably  with the function  point analysis,  which has recently become
mandatory  in public projects.
C) COCOMO(Constructive  Cost Model)
COCOMO  is one of the estimation  methods  of the cost of a software  development  project. It calculates  the
cost by using a regression  formula  with parameters  such as development  period, man per month, and mainte-
nance costs that are put into the modules  and subsystems  that make up the system.
COCOMO  is divided into three types: Basic, Intermediate,  and Detailed,  depending  on the complexity  of the
calculation  model. In addition,  it is divided into three types: Organic  Mode, Semi-Detached  Mode, and Embed-
ded Mode, according  to the type of applied project. Each is calculated  by taking into account  the effort, devel-
opment  time, average  staff size and productivity.
A brief look at the COCOMO  calculation  method  is as follows:
Case of the Basic COCOMO  model
@ Effort Applied)  E = a * (KLOC)  >
*aand  b are coefficients  by project  type (see table below)
* KLOC (Kilo Line Of Code) is the estimated  number  of delivered  lines of code in thousands
