C) Conduct  scenarios  and rehearsals  (practice)
Scenario  is a kind of simulation  of using a given time in a certain way. No matter how good the presentation
material  is, if you aren't prepared  to when to throw a certain message,  the presentation  is highly likely to fail.
Therefore,  it is good to write a message  to explain in a slide note and print it out for rehearsal.  Rehearsal  is
good to practice  once or twice by imaging  as if there is an audience  to hear you.
D) Relaxing  tension  before starting
Tension  is the greatest  enemy  of the presentation,  and lowering  tension  is a very important  factor in an actual
presentation.  An example  of how to reduce tension  before a presentation  is below.
* Clench  and unclench  your fist repetitively.
+ Do a belly breathing.  Repeat  inhaling  deeply  and exhaling  long.
+ Go to the presentation  venue early to get ready.
+ Do more rehearsals  to enhance  confidence.
+ Having a chat with a colleague  before the start can reduce the tension
+ Encourage  yourself  by saying “It’s okay to make a mistake.”  and “Right now! I'm okay.” in your mind.
E) First greeting
Most novice presenters  are not good at first greeting.  That's why you may feel nervous  throughout  the entire
presentation,  as if the first button was misplaced.  For example,  let's say you made your first greeting  as fol-
lows.
“Good morning.  I'm A from OO department  at OO Company.  (Greeting  at the same time)
“Good morning.”  (Greeting),  “I’m A from OO department  at OO Company,  It's nice to see you.”
Which would be better?  In the first case, there are too many words to say before bowing.  The timing to make
a bow may not coincide  with the applause  of the audience.
As in the second example,  if you greet the audience  with a short greeting  message  to the audience,  and after
receiving  applause,  look around and introduce  yourself,  you will be able to give a more relaxed presentation.
F) Responding  to the audience's  reaction
The presentation  is present. You make a connection  with others and communicate  with them, and the pur-
pose is to draw empathy  and make the other person make decisions.
You should be able to think about the voice tone, speed, content,  emphasis,  and story transition  from various
angles while monitoring  the reaction  of the other person. The positive  and negative  reactions  of the audience
are as follows.
