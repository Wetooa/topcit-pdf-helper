@ Configuration  of ERP
Most operational  functions  of an enterprise,  from purchasing  to production,  distribution,  marketing,  sales, service,
finance, accounting  and human resources,  are organized  in a way that ensures  interdependencies  between  the
functions  and a balanced  distribution  of resources.
For example,  when a customer  places an order, the sales representative  enters it into the ERP system and the
finalized  order data (how much, where and when the delivery  must be made) are communicated  to the department
which requires  the data. To meet the order, the data concerning  raw materials  (when, how much and at what price
they were procured)  are also sent to the relevant  department  in a similar fashion. The factory  will produce  the
order on schedule,  and the production  data will be entered into the ERP system and transmitted  to the shipping
department.  The shipping  department  will then deliver  the goods to the customer  on the desired  date.
The ERP system  provides  an environment  in which these operations  can take place organically.
