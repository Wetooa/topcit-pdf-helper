SISD is a single processor  system that sequentially  processes  an instruction  and data, one at a time. It is the
conventional  computer  architecture  that follows von Neumann's  concept.  The controller  interprets  an instruction
and operates  the processor  in order to run the instruction  while fetching  a piece of data from the memory  unit and
processing  it. The performance  may deteriorate,  since it requires  reading  the instruction  each time it acquires  the
processing  data. The performance  may be improved  by using simultaneous  processing  techniques,  such as pipelining
and superscalar.

The structure  of processing  multiple data with an instruction  to simultaneously  perform the same operation  on
multiple  data. It is also called an array processor,  as it enables  synchronous  parallel processing,  Intel’s processor,  made
in the SIMD structure,  is the Pentium  processor  with the MMX instruction  set. The name is “multimedia  acceleration,”
which is the code that can quickly process  frequently-used  floating-point  arithmetic  operations.  The processing
speed is high because  it can process  multiple  operations  with an instruction.
