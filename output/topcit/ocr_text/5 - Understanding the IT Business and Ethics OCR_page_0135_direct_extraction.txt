>> Recent  trends and key issues
The rapid development  of IT network  and IT infrastructure technologies  has not only brought  about
a revolution  in the IT industry,  but also introduced  IT-based  innovations  across all industries. Existing
products  are being reborn as products  with new values through  convergence  with IT technology,  while
technologies  that received  little or no attention  in the early stages of their development  are now becoming
a reality and attracting  renewed  interest  due to their integration  with other technologies.  Meanwhile,  public
services  built around smart infrastructures  have greatly improved  efficiency  in managing  public services.
Diverse industries  are constantly  turning  out new products  that feature convergence  services.  However, it
must be understood  that these market  changes  and paradigm  shifts would not have occurred  without  the
latest IT business  services  and technologies.
