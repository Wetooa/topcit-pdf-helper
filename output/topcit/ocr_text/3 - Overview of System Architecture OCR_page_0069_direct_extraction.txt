B) Factors  for performance  evaluation  of memory  unit
+ Capacity
+ Access  time
+ Cycle time
+ Bandwidth  of storage  unit
+ Data transportation
+ Cost
C) Type and characteristics  of the memory  unit
Memory  units can be classified  according  to the use, physical storing method,  data retention,  and content
preservation.
Table 12) Types of Memory  Units
Classification  Criteria Description Type
Main memory  | Memory  device to temporarily  store a program  or RAM and ROM
device data that a computer  processes
Usage Auniliary Amemory  device that stores  data semi- /
permanently  by compensating  for the mainmemory : : ; Magnetic  disk, optical disk, etc.
. memory’s  insufficient  storage  capacity  and usingdevice : vas
non-volatile  characteristics
Magnetic A device  that stores binary data according  to the Magnetic  tape, hard disk, zip drive, etc.magnetic  flux direction  by maintaining  magnetism
Physical A device that records data on the surface of an cD (Compact  Disc)
poles Optical aluminum metallic disk using a laser beam DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)method BDA (Blu-Ray  Disk)
Semiconductor A device  that stores analog  data using integrated RAM, ROM, and flash memory
circuit technology
Data aintainable Volatile The memory  that loses all data when power is off | RAM-based  SSD (Solid State Disk)
when power . The memory  that preserves  stored data even ROM, magnetic  core, and auxiliary
is off Non-volatile ;when power  is off memory  device
Sequential To access the required  location  in the memory
. . Magnetic  tapeaccess space sequentially  from the beginning
Access  method - -
, To directly  access  the required  location  in the ,
Direct access Disk, flash memory,  etc.memory  space
Destructive The memory  in which the stored data are Magnetic  core
Preservation  of destroyed  after reading
data Non- The memory  that retains the stored data even Memory  devices except for the
destructive after reading magnetic  core
D) Addressing  mode
An address is the location  in the main memory  where data is stored. Various addressing  methods  are available  to
designate  instructions,  using limited instruction  bits and using the memory  unit capacity  efficiently.
+ Direct addressing  mode
+ Indirect  addressing  mode
+ Implied  addressing  mode
