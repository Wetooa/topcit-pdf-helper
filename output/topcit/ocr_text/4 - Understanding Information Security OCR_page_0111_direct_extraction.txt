Information  security
The modification  of message  attack  obtains  unauthorized  results by illegallychanging  parts of legal messages,
delaying  message  transmission,  or changing  the message  sequence.
The denial-of-service  attack interferes  the normal use or management  of communication  equipment  (specific
computer  or network).  This attack is generally  called a DoS attack. Most of these attacks  are made against  a
specific  target.
The active attack has characteristics  that are opposite  to the passive attack. It is very difficult  to prevent
active attacks completely,  because  all communication  equipment  and communication  lines cannot be
physically  protected  at all times. Response  to active attacks  aims to detect an attack and recover  from the
collapse  or delay, due to such an attack.
