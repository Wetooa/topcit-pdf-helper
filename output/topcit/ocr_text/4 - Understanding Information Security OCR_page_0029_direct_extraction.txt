Information  security )
only two keys, that is, their own private key and a public key.
The public key cipher has the advantage  of being used for various authentication  functions  and secure key
exchange,  because  only each user knows their private key corresponding  to the public key, which can be
checked  by everyone.  RSA (Rivest, Shamir  and Adleman),  ElGamal,  and ECC (Elliptic  Curve Cryptosystem)  are
the representative  public key cryptographic  algorithms.
*RSA
The RSA public key cryptosystem  is used for encryption  and authentication.  The safety of this system is:
based on the difficulty  of factoring  a large integer. RSA has the characteristic  that ciphertext  for the same
message  is always the same, because  no random numbers  are used in the encryption  process.  Since the
safety of the RSA system depends  on prime number  p and q, the prime number  selection  conditions  are
important.
+ ElGamal
ElGamal was proposed in 1984 by Stanford  University  cryptographer,  T. ElGamal,  and is the first public
key cryptographic  algorithm,  based on the difficulty  of the discrete  algebra problem.  When a message  is
encrypted  with ElGamal,  its length is doubled.  However,  different  ciphertext  is created  each time, even
though the same message  is encrypted  because  random numbers  are used for encryption, which is a great
advantage  from the perspective  of information  security.
+ ECC
The Elliptic Curves encryption  system is based on the discrete  logarithm  problem  on the elliptic curve. Since
its safety is high and its speed is fast, it draws attention  as a new public key encryption  system.  For example,
it is known that a 1024-bit  key of RSA and a 160-bit key of elliptic curve cipher have the same level of
security.  In addition,  the ECC system is suitable  for the encryption  of mobile communication,  such as a mobile
phone with limited power supply.
