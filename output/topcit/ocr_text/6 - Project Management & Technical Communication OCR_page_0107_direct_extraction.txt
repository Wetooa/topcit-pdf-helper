[Figure 35] Cost Control  Screen (Example)
In the example  above, the duration  of the [Writing]  activity  was calculated  as five days, and it was planned
to be completed  by July 31st. As of August Ist, the five days of planning  have not been completed.  If the ac-
tivity is calculated  as the cost (assuming  KRW 300,000  per day), it is 5 (days) x 0.9 (completion  rate) x KRW
300,000  = KRW 1,350,000.  In addition,  if the activity had been completed  as scheduled,  it would be, if calcu-
lated as a cost, KRW 1,500,000.  In other words, as of August Ist, 1,500,000-1,350,000  = KRW 150,000  of work
has not been completed,  meaning  the cost of KRW 150,000  has been excessively  spent.
The above cost control management  method is called Earned Value Method,  and cost control management
applying  EVM is called Earned Value Management.
03 Cost Estimation  Technique
The most common  project  cost estimation  techniques  include  Function  Point (FP), Man/Month  (M/M), and COCOMO.
A) Function  point (FP)
Function  Point is a method  of estimating  the cost by measuring  the scale of software  development  as a Func-
tion Point (FP) and multiplying  the unit price per function  point. It is an international  standard  (ISO/IEC  14143)
that quantitatively  calculates  functions  requested  by and delivered  to users from a user's point of view, and is
a cost calculation  method  for software  development,  maintenance  and operation.
Compared  to the LOC (Line Of Code)-based  COCOMO  method or the Man/Month  (M/M) method,  it has the
characteristic  of grasping  the size of the development  project before initiation  by identifying  the required
function  of the user.
Software  functions  are divided into Data Functions  and Transaction  Functions,  and more specifically,  data
functions  are subdivided  into Internal Logical Files and External  Interface  Files, and transaction  functions  are
subdivided  into three types: External  Inputs, External  Outputs,  and External  Inquiries.
