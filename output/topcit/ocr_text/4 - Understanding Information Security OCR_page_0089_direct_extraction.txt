B) Method  of controlling  access  to the database
@ Agent  method
A method of accessing  a database,  using a dedicated  client for database  access, after installing  an agent
with the access control and logging function in the database  server itself. This method  can implement  strong
access  control,  but it can cause performance  degradation  of the database  server, due to the traffic therein.

@ Gateway  method
A method  of passing  all database  server  connection  requests  through  the database  access  control server (proxy
server). This method provides  the most powerful  access control function.  As the database  access control
server can be configured  in redundancy,  work is not affected,  even when  a failure  occurs.

© Network  sniffing  method
A method  of analyzing  and logging network  packets,  using TAP equipment,  etc. There is no need to install a
separate  agent between  the database  server and client, and a system can be built, without  any load on the
network.  However,  it is not easy to fundamentally  block the damage  to the data integrity  caused by improper
alteration.
