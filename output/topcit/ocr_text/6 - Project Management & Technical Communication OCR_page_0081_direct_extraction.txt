O2 Project  Management  Methodology
A) Project  management  methodology
Typical project  management  methodologies  include PMBOK,  ISO 21500, and PRINCE2.
The most representative  PMBOK  (Project  Management  Body of Knowledge)  is a project management  knowl-
edge system published  by the PMI (Project  Management  Institute),  a non-profit  project management  organi-
zation in the United States. In September  2017, the 6th edition of PMBOK  was released,  which consists  of five
process  groups: initiating,  planning,  executing,  monitoring  and controlling,  and closing; 10 knowledge  areas:
scope, cost, schedule,  quality, risk, communication,  resources,  procurement,  and stakeholder  management:
and a total of 49 processes.  In the 6th edition of PMBOK, the project manager's  Talent Triangle (Technical
Project Management,  Leadership,  Strategic  and Business  Management)  was added. PMI operates the  PMP
(Project  Management  Professional)  qualification  system as the license of project  management  experts.
ISO 21500 is a project  management  standard  established  by ISO (International  Standard  Organization),  an in-
ternational  organization  for standardization.  The overall content  is similar  to that of PMBOK.
Unlike PMBOK, PRINCE2  (PRojects  IN Controlled  Environments)  is a structured  project management  method-
ology developed  in the UK and mainly used in Europe and Australia,  and a project management  professional
license.  It consists  of Seven Principles  (Continued  Business  Justification,  Learn From Experience,  Defined  Roles
and Responsibilities,  Manage  by Stages, Manage by Exception,  Focus on Products,  Tailor to Suit Project En-
vironment);  Seven Themes  (Business  Case, Organization,  Quality, Plans, Risk, Change,  Progress);  and Seven
Processes  (Starting  Up A Project,  Initiating  A Project,  Directing  A Project,  Controlling  A Stage, Managing  Prod-
uct Delivery,  Managing  Stage Boundaries,  Closing  A Project).  While PMBOK describes  project management
centered  on the project manager,  PRINCE2  deals with project  management  more practically,  focusing  on vari-
ous participants  and outputs  in addition  to the project  manager.
The project management  methodology  defines  the project life cycle and clarifies  and manages  inputs, tools
and technologies,  and outputs  in detail through  the systems  engineering  approach  at each stage, to support
the achievement  of project  goals using limited resources.  Recently,  Agile methodology  as a flexible and practi-
cal approach  to project  management  is garnering  a lot of attention.
B) Agile methodology
Agile methodology  is an adaptive  model that continuously  creates prototypes  at regular intervals,  adds and
modifies  requirements  in a timely manner,  compared  to existing  traditional  methodologies  based on thorough
planning  and explicit  outputs.
The purpose  and spirit of Agile methodology  is well represented  in the Agile Manifesto.

+ Individuals  and interactions  over processes  and tools
+ Working  software  over comprehensive  documentation
