Windows  and Android,  and the web platform  based on the web browser.  FIDO server, RP server, and RP client
are the components  that should be provided  by the server. Therefore,  if they are regarded  as a part of the
server, the standard  protocol is not needed anymore.  Therefore,  FIDO 2.0 does not use the UAF protocol,  but
exchanges  messages,  using its own protocol defined by the server. The FIDO client, which was provided  as an
Android  app in the existing  FIDO 1.0, will be provided  as an API by the operating  system,  or as a JavaScript  API
by the web browser.
C) Network  segregation  and network  linking
Network  segregation  refers to network  blocking,  which separates the business  network  from the external
network  in order to block illegal access from the external Internet  network  and to prevent  the leakage  of
internal information.  There are two types - physical  network  segregation  and logical network  segregation.

D) Fraud Detection  System  (FDS)
The FDS is a system that detects suspicious  transactions  and blocks abnormal  financial  transactions  by
comprehensively  analyzing  device information,  access information,  and transaction  details used in electronic
financial  transactions.  Pattern analysis is the core engine of the FDS because  the usual transactions  of the
user are analyzed,  and abnormal  behavior  is detected  when an action that violates  the analyzed  pattern is
taken. The FDS has the following  functions.
© Information  collection
The FDS collects  user media environment  information  and accident  type information  by collecting  information
on user information  and behavior.
@ Analysis  and detection
The FDS detects  abnormal  behavior  by analyzing  various correlations  by user type and transaction  type, and
by testing  the pattern,  based on the analysis  of abnormal  behavior,  using the collected  information.
@ Response
The FDS blocks an illegal transaction  by blocking  the transaction  or by requiring  additional  authentication  when
abnormal  behavior  is detected.
