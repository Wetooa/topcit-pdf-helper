02 Risk Management  Process
Risk management  is generally  carried out over the following  four stages:
Risk Identification ish Aurel  ys) Risk Response Risk control
Evaluation
+ Primary  risk + Evaluation  based + Risk avoid, mitigate, + Observation  of risk
recognition on probability  and transfer, acceptance response
+ Risk categorization impact + Financial/ + Risk assessment
+ Risk profiling Organizational + Early warning

A) Risk identification
It is important  to find the risks in the right time as possible.  Risk identification  involves  identifying  and docu-
menting  risks that may affect the project. A commonly  used risk identification  method is documentation  re-
view. The scope and schedule  of tasks specified  in the contract  are legally valid and should be prioritized.  The
contract,  proposal,  and project  execution  plan should be cross-checked  and double-checked  for any omission.
If something  omitted  from the project  execution  plan is specified  in the contract  or proposal,  even if it is not
actually  implemented,  it violates  the acceptance  criteria.
<Table 64> Risk Identification  Method
Risk Identification Explanation
Method
Documentation  Reviews | Review  plans, assumptions,  previous  related project  files, contracts  and project  documents
Information  Gathering  | Use techniques  such as brainstorming,  Delphi Technique, interviews,  and root cause analysis  to
Techniques identify  risks.
Create a checklist  based on precedents  and knowledge  accumulated  in similar projects  or
Checklist  Analysis other sources  of information.  The lowest level of RBS (Risk Breakdown  Structure)  can be used
as a risk checklist
Examine  the validity  of assumptions  and identify  inaccuracy,  instability,  inconsistency  or
Assumption  Analysis incompleteness  of assumptions  as project risks
Use diagramming  techniques  to identify  risks, such as a Cause and Effect Diagram,  a
Diagramming  Techniques  | System  or Process  Flow Diagram  that expresses  how various  elements  of the system are
interconnected,  an Interrelationship  Diagram  that depicts  the relationship  among  factors,  etc.
