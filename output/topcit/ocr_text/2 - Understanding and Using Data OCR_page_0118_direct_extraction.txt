04 Query Optimization  and Optimizer
Query optimization  refers to the process  of making  a DBMS select one optimal strategy  by systematically  evaluating
several strategies  for executing  query statements.  It is used by systems  that support  advanced  relational  query
languages.
A) Query optimization  process
@ For query optimization,  the intermediate  query statement  created  by the parser is converted  into a certain form of
sub-expression  and represented  as a query tree.
@ Then, an internal expression  is rewritten  into an efficient  query statement  using logical conversion  rules. Multiple
conditions  are combined  into one condition,  and projection  is performed  as early as possible  to remove any
unnecessary  attributes.  Selection  is also performed  as early as possible.
© Access  plans are created  and specified  by the join procedure,  selection  procedure,  etc.
@ The most efficient  access plan is selected  by evaluating  them. The evaluation  criteria to consider  include the disk
access cost, storage  cost, calculation  cost, and communication  cost.
B) Optimizer
An optimizer,  as the core engine of the DBMS, checks for grammatical  errors in SQL statements  according  to the
various requests  of the user, and then finds an optimal path or a processing  procedure  by creating  and adopting  the
fastest  data access path. When SQL specifies  the desired data (what) in a relational  database,  the DBMS optimizer
automatically  decides  and handles how to get the data. As such, the optimizer,  which guarantees  the physical data
independence  of the database  and finds the method of executing  the user's SQL queries efficiently,  is making a
significant  contribution  to the commercial  success  of the relational  database.
C) Roles of the optimizer  in each query processing  phase
Query processing  is divided into 5 phases - parsing,  query rewriting,  query optimization,  QEP generation,  and query
execution.  The optimizer  acts in the query rewriting  and query optimization  phase. QEP (Query  Execution  Plan) refers
to a query execution  plan, which is the detailed  information  necessary  to execute  a query.
