planning,  acquisition, and contracting  stage.
In the planning  stage, preliminary  work such as feasibility  analysis  and budget  planning  of the project  is carried
out. In the acquisition  stage, scope definition  and Request  For Proposal  (RFP) are carried out, and if necessary,
a RFP briefing  can be held. Subsequently,  in the contracting  phase, the proposal  submitted  to select a business
operator  is evaluated,  and the final business  operator  selection  and contracting  are conducted  through
technical  negotiations.
When planning  a new project,  it is necessary  to approve  the unit project or program  according  to the portfolio
under management  to achieve  the organization's  enterprise-wide  strategic  goals. In addition,  a high-level  plan
for the project should be reviewed by considering  whether  there is an integrated  management  program  for
relevant  projects.
There is a Project  Cost/Efforts  Curve as shown below that demonstrates  the importance  of the initial project
planning  stage. If enough  time is spent on planning  in the early stages, unnecessary  confusion  can be avoided
in the latter stages. This is because,  if you predict  various  risks or issues that may occur during initial planning,
and establish  a response  plan in advance,  or a process  for handling  unexpected  problems,  you can respond
effectively  in case of various risks or issues that may arise in the project process.  On the other hand, if the
initial plan is poorly formulated  and executed  right away, the project may seem to be progressing  quickly at
first yet cause confusion  at an exponential  rate as it moves through  the latter stages. Many projects  neglect
the initial planning  stage and jump directly  to the executing  stage, resulting  in a failure of the entire project.

From the developer's  point of view, a proposal  is made in advance  to initiate a project. A proposal  is the act
of writing and submitting  a document  to the acquirer  to win the order based on the RFP from the acquirer. It
contains  the proposal  outline, introduction  of the proposing  company,  project execution and management.
After the evaluation  of the submitted  proposal,  if it is selected  as the preferred  bidder, the contract  is
concluded  through  technical  negotiation,  and the project  begins.
