@ Graph
A graph is data structure  that expresses  the many-to-many  relationship  between  the connected  elements,  and
is a set of vertices  that represent  objects and the edges that connect  those objects. Graph data structures
often solve problems  based on graph theory by expressing  several complex  problems  on a graph, such as
electric  circuit analysis,  shortest  distance  search, artificial  intelligence,  etc.
<Table 11> Types of graphs
Type Description
Undirected  | A graph that is connected  by undirected  lines between  the
graph vertices of the graph.
Directed A graph whose connection  lines are directional,  where the
graph sequence  of vertices  expressed  in pairs is important. =)v©)
[N;| Complete  | A graph that has as many edges as possible  by connecting
graph all the vertices  with each other on the graph./tNh
Weighted  | A graph in which a weighted  value is assigned  to the edges
graph that pass through  the vertices  of the graph.
The graph is expressed  in memory  using various  graphing  methods  depending  on the function being performed
or method  of application.
+ Adjacency matrix: A method of graphing  using a sequential  data structure.  The presence  of the edge
connecting  two vertices  of the graph as a matrix is stored in a matrix by using a two-dimensional array for
the matrix.
+ Adjacency  List: A graphing  method  using a linked data structure.  Nodes are connected  as many times as the
sequence  number  of each vertex using a simple linked list created by connecting  adjacent  vertices  for each
vertex.
