[Figure 147] Standard  Scope  of Each loT Standardization  Organization  [10]
C) Core loT technologies
loT’s main technologies  are a sensing  technology,  a wired and wireless  communication  and network  infrastructure
technology,  and an loT service  and interface  technology.
@ Sensing  technology
Sensors  collect object information.  Various sensors, such as temperature,  humidity,  heat, gas, illuminance,  and
ultrasonic  waves, are installed  in the object  to obtain information  about  the surrounding  situation.  Sensors  are needed
to minimize  power consumption  in order to operate  for a long time. Physical  sensors  have evolved  into smart sensors
with a standardized  interface and information  processing  capability,  and they include  a virtual sensing  function  that
extracts  specific information  from the sensed data. As the sensor layer's role has increased,  the hardware  platform
market  is evolving  to facilitate  connecting  various sensors,  control,  and communication,  using open-source  hardware
(OSHW).
@ Wired/wireless  communication  and network  infrastructure  technology
Although  objects generally  use wired means, such as Ethernet  or power line communication  (PLC), to access the
Internet,  wireless  communication  is more efficient  when considering  the installation  convenience  and mobility.  Short-
range wireless  communication,  such as WLAN, Bluetooth,  ZigBee, and UWB, and mobile communication,  such as 3G
and LTE, are available.  Moreover,  new technologies  for sensor  networking  are constantly  being proposed.
+ BLE (Bluetooth  Low Energy):  Also called Bluetooth  Smart, it is low-power,  short-range  wireless  communication  that
is not compatible  with existing  Bluetooth  but is compatible  with Bluetooth  4.0.
+ Z-Wave: It is a protocol  for devices  that use intelligent  mesh network  topology,  do not have a master  node, and
require low power and low bandwidth.
