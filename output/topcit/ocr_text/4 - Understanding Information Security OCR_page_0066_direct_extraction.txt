© Risk identification
+ A risk means the possibility  that an unexpected  situation  occurs and affects (damages)  an organization,  and
can be expressed  as a function  of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.  The value of each information  asset
should be estimated,  and risks of each asset should be identified  during the risk identification process.
@ Risk assessment
+ The scope of risk analysis  should be selected  based on the scope of the information  security  management
system, according  to the business,  organizational,  locational,  asset, and technical  characteristics  during the
risk assessment  process.
+ For efficient  risk analysis,  a quantitative  or qualitative  method should be selected,  depending  on whether
the risk can be quantified  or not. Alternatively,  the baseline  approach,  detailed risk approach,  or combined
approach  should be selected,  depending  on the approach.
