+ The objective  is to represent  and link up web data in a formalized  structure
Assignment  of linke + The objective  is to make the job of linking data existing  on the Web a lot easier by
information assigning  link information.
+ Usefulness  of linked data
Linked data can be reused, reduce redundancy,  and maximize  interoperability  to achieve data integration.
Furthermore,  added value can be created  through  linked data and network  effects  will result in data expansion.
