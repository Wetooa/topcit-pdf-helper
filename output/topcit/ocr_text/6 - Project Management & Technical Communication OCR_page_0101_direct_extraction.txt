[Figure 33] Critical Path Method@  (Example)
Any delay in activities  on the critical path will result in a delay in the overall project  schedule.  Hence, activities
on the critical path become  intensive  targets  of schedule  management.
B) Schedule  development  technique  - critical chain method  (CCM)
Critical Chain Technique  or Critical Chain Method  is a scheduling  method  that allows the project  team to buf-
fer the project  schedule  in consideration  of limited resources  and uncertainty.
In order to consider  the effects  of resource  allocation,  optimization  and leveling,  and activity duration  un-
certainty  on the critical path determined  by the Critical Path Method,  the concept  of buffering  and buffering
management  is added to the CPM.
The figure below shows how Buffer is added to the example  of the CPM assuming  the uncertainty  of the du-
ration of the activities.
[Figure  34] Critical  Chain Method  (Example)
The buffer  added at the end of the critical chain is called Project  Buffer, and it its to prevent  the target finish date from
slippage  along the critical chain.
An additional  buffer, called Feeding  Buffer, is placed at each point at which non-critical  activities which don’t belong to
the critical chain (red line in the figure) merges into the critical chain. The size of the feeding  buffer should be deter-
mined by taking into account  the uncertainty  over the duration  of the feeding  chain linked up to that buffer.
After determining  the buffer schedule,  the activities scheduled  for the latest possible  start and finish dates should be
scheduled.  As a result, the critical chain method  focuses  on managing  remaining  buffer durations  against  the remaining
durations  of chains of activities,  instead  of the total float of network  paths.
