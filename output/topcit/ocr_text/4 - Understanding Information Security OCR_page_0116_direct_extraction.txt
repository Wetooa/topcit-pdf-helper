the structure  of the TCP/IP protocol.  [Figure 59] shows security  protocols  by layer, based on the OS! 7-layer
reference  model.
+ Security  protocols  related to the application  layer
There are various  security  protocols  related to the application  layer, such as PGP and S/MIME that provide
e-mail security  function,  Kerberos  that provides  authentication  functions,  and SSH (secure shell) that
supports  secure  remote  access,  etc.
+ Security  protocols  related  to the transport  layer
SSL (Secure Socket Layer)/TLS (Transport  Layer Security)  is a protocol  that acts above the transport  layer,
which provides  the secure transport  layer services to the application  layer. TLS is the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) standard  for SSL, and it provides  end-to-end  security  and data integrity.
+ Security  protocols  related  to the Internet
The IPSec (IP Security)  protocol  that acts above the Internet  layer, which provides  security  features,  such as
authentication  and encryption,  to the Internet  layer. This protocol  is used to implement  VPN services.

C) Types of network  attacks  and countermeasures
@ DoS attack
The DoS attack disturbs  the normal operation  of a specific server by causing  various types of load. It is an
attack on availability,  one of the security services.  Typical DoS attacks include land attacks, ping of death
attacks,  Syn flooding  attacks,  and Boink attacks.
+ Land attack
An attack that sends a packet  to the target, by making  the IP address  of the source and destination  identical
to the attacker's  IP address.  Server  operation  fails, due to serious  failure in the IP protocol  stack because  the
host that receives  the packet  falls into an infinite loop of receiving  and sending  the packet.
This attack can be responded  to by blocking  packets  whose source IP address  is the same as the server's  IP
address,  among  the packets  flowing  into the network,  using a router or packet  filtering  tool.
+ Ping of death attack
When an attacker  makes an ICMP packet that much larger than the normal  size and sends it, the packet is
divided into many small fragments  and transmitted  to the attacking  network.  Accordingly,  the attack target
