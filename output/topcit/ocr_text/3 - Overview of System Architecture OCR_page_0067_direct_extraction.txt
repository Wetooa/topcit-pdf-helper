<Table 10> shows  the entire instruction  cycle. The CPU components  needed in each cycle are different.
<Table 10) Relationship  between  Instruction  Cycle Types and CPU Components
Type Detailed  Operation Related  CPU Component
Fetch cycle+ The cycle fetches  an instruction  from the memory  unit location
pointed  to by the PC.- Register  (PC, MAR, MBR, and IR)
~ CPU internal  bus
Execution  cycle+ The CPU decodes  the fetched  instruction  code and performs  the
needed  operation,  according  to the result.- Register  (AC)
- ALU
- Control  unit
Interruption  cycle+ The cycle inspects  the interruption  request  signal, stores the
current  PC data in the stack, and loads the ISR’s beginning
address  to the PC.- Register  (MBR, PC, MAR, SP)
Indirect  cycle+ The cycle is the process  of reading  the actual data address  from
the memory  unit before the execution  cycle begins.
E) Instruction  set structure,  CISC and RISC
Instruction  set, or ins’- Register  (MAR, IR, MBR)
- CPU internal  bus
ruction set architecture  (ISA), refers to the machine  language  instructions  that a microprocessor
can recognize,  understand  its function,  and execute.  The ISA is part of the programming-related  computer
architecture,  and it includes  data types, instructions,  registers,  addressing  modes, memory  structures,  interruptions,
exception  handling,  and external  input/output.
The leading ISAs are the complex  instruction  set computer  (CISC) and the Reduced  instruction  set computer  (RISC).
<Table 4> shows the concepts  and differences  in these structures,
* CISC:A complex  instruction-type  computer  that embeds  many complex  instructions  into the hardware  in order to
process  the complex  instructions  as a single instruction.
* RISC: A reduced instruction-type  computer  that embeds  a few simple instructions  into the hardware  to process
complex  instructions  as a set of simple instructions.
