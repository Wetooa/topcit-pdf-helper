Data’. This suggests  standards  on methods  of de-identification  for big data utilization  to ensure the safety of
personal  data, and for businesses  who intend to use and provide  de-identified  personal  data.
<Procedure  for de-identification  for big data utilization>
@  (Preliminary  Review)  Verify whether  specific  data is personal  data or not. Data that is confirmed  to be non-personal
data can be used as freely as possible  without  any legal restrictions.
@ (De-identification)  Take measures  to make individuals  unidentifiable  by means of, for example,  deleting  or replacing
all or some of the elements  from dataset.  If the attributor  included  in the dataset  is not related to the purpose  of
data use, it is deleted  in principle.
@(Adequacy  Assessment)  Assess whether  an individual  is identifiable  by easily combining  de-identified  data with
other data by the “De-identification  Adequacy  Assessment  Panel”
@ (Follow-up  Management)  Take necessary  measures  such as safety measures  for de-identified  data and monitoring
likelihood  of re-identification  to prevent  re-identification  in the process  of using de-identified  data.
Managerial Safety Measures:  Need to designate  a person in charge of de-identified  data files, prohibit  sharing  of
data on de-identification,  and destroy  data once a purpose  of usage is achieved.
Technical  Safety Measures:  Need to restrict access to de-identified  data files, manage  access records, and install
and operate  security  programs.
+ Protective  measures  when de-identified  data is leaked: Analyze  cause of leakage,  and implement  both managerial
and technical  safety measures  to prevent  additional  leakage,  Withdraw  and destroy  leaked de-identified  data
@ Ethical Issues of Autonomous  Vehicles
Self-driving  cars are integrated  with technology  that collects information  from the external  environment,
communication  technology  among vehicles  and between  vehicles  and road infrastructure,  and advanced  information
processing  technology  and excellent  algorithms.
Self-driving  cars store information  gathered  from sensors in the cloud and analyze them with big data to find the
optimal route. Since it reduces  the accident  rate from the user's point of view, it provides  stability  and saves users
the time to concentrate  on driving, providing  convenience  and efficiency.
However,  like the recent incident  on the Internet  where a company  hacks and remotely  controls  autonomous  vehicles,
problems  such as remote control attacks  by hacking  and information  leakage due to malicious  code infection  are
emerging  as related issues. The major ethical issues related  to self-driving  cars are as follows.
+ The ethical dilemma  of self-driving  cars (controversy  on how to deal with accidents  and who is the cause of the
accident)
+ Safety issues of autonomous  vehicles (reaction  to detection  of pedestrians  and obstacles  in the vehicle path,
occupant  protection  and safety)
+ Remote  control attack and availability  threat due to hacking
+ Threat  of life and property  loss due to hacking,  real-time  exposure  of user information
+ Privacy  invasion  due to leakage  of personal  information  collected  by in-vehicle  sensors  and computers  such as travel
