C) Standard  e-Government  framework
@ Introduction  to the standard  e-Government  framework
Designed  for public projects,  the standard  e-government  framework  standardizes  and implements  the
basic functions  necessary  for developing  and operating  a Java-based  system.  The framework  provides  the
implemented  environment  (execution,  development,  management,  and operation)  and common  modules  that
are the basis for developing  various types of software  required by the private sector and the government.
Developers can  develop a system by reusing the common  modules  in the base environment  provided  by the
standard  framework  and by developing  unique functions  exclusively  for each service.
@ Purpose  and characteristics  of the standard  e-government  framework
The framework  aims to standardize  application  software  and improve  quality and reusability  by establishing  a
development  framework  that can be applied to public projects.
+ Improves  e-Government  service quality.
+ Improves  the efficiency  of investment  in informatization.
+ Enables  fair competition  by conglomerates  and small and medium-sized  businesses  using the same development
base.
