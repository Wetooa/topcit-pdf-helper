Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
There may be several causes of this paradox,  but in most cases it is attributable  to the lack of a system for clearly
explaining  a company’s  business  and IT operations  to its stakeholders  from an overall perspective.  For these reasons,
enterprises  need an EA, as it can provide  a bird’s eye view of the enterprise’s  business  while simultaneously  creating
close working  relationships  between  different  information  resources.
B) Conceptual  diagram  of an EA and its components
@ Conceptual  diagram  of an EA
The deployment  of an EA starts with the enterprise  business  strategy.  The enterprise  business  strategy  is converged
with the IT strategy,  and the EA is the fruit of this convergence.

@ The components  of an EA
An EA is delegated  or inherits  the IT governance  control system. To be more precise, the establishment  of an EA
itself is both an act of IT governance  and an instrument  of IT governance  control.
In addition  to IT governance,  the key components  of an EA are business  architecture  (BA), applied architecture
(AA), data architecture  (DA), and technology  architecture  (TA). The standard  profile (SP) is a sub-structure of the
technology  architecture  and can be understood  as the detailed  specifications  of a list of technologies,
