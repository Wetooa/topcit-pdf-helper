C) Stack and queue
@ Stack
A stack is one of the linear lists. In this data structure,  data are saved in the storage space in order of data
input, and the last input data are output first. That is, an element  stored in the stack can be accessed  only
from the place designated  as the top, and an element  is inserted  at the top only and the inserted  element  is
stacked  on the top and output  first.

Stack
[Figure  2] Conceptual  diagram  of the stack
The types of stack operations  are as follows.
+ top(): Returns  the data value at the top of the stack.
+ push(): Inserts data on the stack.
+ pop(): Deletes  and returns  data from the stack.
+ isempty():  Returns ‘true’ if there is no element  on the stack or returns ‘false’ if there is an element  on the
stack.
+ isfull(): Returns  ‘false’ if there is no element  on the stack or returns ‘true’ if there is an element  on the stack.
@ Queue
Like the stack, the location  of insertion  and deletion is limited. However,  unlike the stack, the place of data
insertion  is different  from that of deletion.  The queue has a structure  in which an element  can be inserted  at
the bottom  and deleted at the top only. Elements  are listed in order of insertion,  and the element  inserted  first
is at the front and thus is deleted  first.
