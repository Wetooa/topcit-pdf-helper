@ SIP message  structure
SIP uses an SIP uniform resource  identifier  (URI), similar to an e-mail address,  to identify  users to provide services,
without  being dependent  on IP addresses.  A SIP message  contains  the START LINE to describe  the method type
to request  and SIP URI, the HEADER  to set the value to control the session, the BODY containing  the type set in
Content-Type,  and CR/LF a blank space between  HEADER  and BODY.
C) H.323
H.323 is an ITU-T standard  for providing  voice, data, and video services  over LAN where quality is not guaranteed.
Startup  VoIP service providers  use it widely because  it can provide multimedia  services  without  changing  the existing
network's  underlying  structure.
[Figure 144] shows the H.323 network  architecture.  The service components  include terminals,  such as general
telephones,  fax machines,  and PCs equipped  with multimedia  equipment  that are used by end users. Other
components  are a gatekeeper  that converts  between  E.164 and the IP address, performs  redirection  and
authentication for calls, and manages  the components  and bandwidth,  and a gateway  that performs  the logical
connection  mapping  (encoding,  protocol,  and call control)  of different  networks  (IP network,  PSTN, ISDN, ATM, etc.).
