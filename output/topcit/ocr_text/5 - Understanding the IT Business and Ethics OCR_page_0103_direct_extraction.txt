The BI dashboard  is one of the most important  elements  of the BI functions  because  it permits users to make
intuitive  judgments.
This is a data visualization  tool that displays  in one glance the status of key quantified  metrics  and performance
metrics  for an enterprise.  Through  dashboards,  metrics such as sales, costs, profits, and risk levels in various areas
are presented  on a single screen so as to help decision  makers make quick decisions  by making  it easier for them to
identify  the areas they should pay close attention  to.
In general,  the screen configuration  of dashboards  is easy to customize  as it supports  easy customization  and easy
integration  with tools such as spreadsheets  and real-time  data analysis.
