@ Methods  of Writing  Meeting  Minutes
In other words, meeting  minutes  are documents  that clarify communication  by organizing  meeting  results. In
case of collaboration,  it is very important  to organize  meeting  minutes  because  the content  of communication
may be subtly changed  later due to differing  interests.  The specific  method  of writing  the minutes  is as follows.
Record  the date and time, place, theme of the meeting,  participants,  discussions,  and decisions.  If the meeting
lasts for a long time, you can use an electronic  recorder.
Minutes  are basically  written in accordance  with the 5W1H principle:  When, where, who, what, how, and why.
It is of utmost  importance  to record the summarized  opinions  presented  at the meeting.  As described  above,
minutes  serve  a role as the official letter that prevents  you from overturning  what was previously  agreed.
The completed  minutes  are circulated  via e-mail  to the attendees  of the meeting,  and opinions  are received  or
signed after public disclosure.  The minutes  of the meeting  must be confirmed  as it will become  an important
document  to record business  process  in the future. Nowadays,  meeting  minutes  are usually shared by e-mail,
so it is good to ask stakeholders  for opinions  after writing in the e-mail, "| have organized  the minutes  as
above, and please review them and offer us your opinion.”,  adding “If there is no special opinion, | will share
them or proceed  as they are.’
