ESSENCE
+ Builder  pattern
- Definition:  Used when the returned  objects  are not the simple inheritance  target of the basic output  object,
but are completely  different  user interfaces  composed  of different  combinations  of objects.
- Advantages:  An object having  different  expression  methods  can be created  in the same way.
- Disadvantage:  It is easy to create a new object, but it is very tricky to modify  each component  of the object.
- Use examples:  When developing  a translator  system that translates  entered Korean into various languages
and outputs  the result.
+ Factory  Method  pattern
- Definition:  A method of indirectly  creating  an object using a proxy function,  rather than directly  calling the
object  constructor.
- Advantages:  Programming  is possible  using the same form, regardless  of the object to be created.
Therefore,  it is flexible and scalable.
- Disadvantages:  A new subclass  must be defined  each time the type of object  to be created  changes.
- Use examples:  When a program  is double  clicked in the OS, the program  is operated  by the OS.
+ Prototype  pattern
- Definition:  A method  of creating  an object by duplicating  an existing  object.
- Advantages:  There is no need to create a separate  class to create an object. An object can be added and
deleted  at runtime.
- Disadvantage:  All classes, which are the data types of objects  to be created,  should implement  the Clone()
member  function.
- Use examples:  When creating  a graphic  editor like MS Visio.
+ Singleton  pattern
- Definition:  Used when fixing the number  of class objects  at less than N.
- Advantages:  Easy to manage  the number  of objects  in the class.
- Use examples:  When a device manager,  which needs only a single object, manages  objects.
