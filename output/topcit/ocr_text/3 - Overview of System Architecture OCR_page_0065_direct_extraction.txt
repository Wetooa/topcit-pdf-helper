Since the von Neumann  and Harvard  architectures  each has advantages  and disadvantages,  the most recent high-
performance  CPUs apply both architectures  in their design. In other words, they separate  the cache memory  for
instruction  and data, and they apply the Harvard  architecture  inside the CPU (CPU and cache) and the von Neumann
architecture  outside  CPU (CPU and memory),  as shown in [Figure  32].

A) Definition  of CPU
The CPU is the most important  part of computers,  as it interprets  instructions  and handles arithmetic  or logical
operations  and data processing.  It plays the key role of running  programs  and processing  data.
B) CPU execution
As shown in <Table 9>, the CPU operation  is divided into a function  that commonly  runs for all instructions,  and a
function  that runs only when necessary,  according  to the instructions.

As shown in [Figure 33], a CPU consists  of a control unit, an arithmetic  logic unit (ALU), registers,  and buses  that
