01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
IT business  services  consist  of a general-purpose  work support system that assists in performing  some of the
tasks involved  in running  a business;  a system that assists decision  makers when making decisions;  and IT service
management  (ITSM), a management  technique  for the systematic  management  of IT services.
The general-purpose  work support  system is composed  of ERP (enterprise  resource  planning),  SCP (supply chain
management),  and CRM (customer  relationship  management),  all of which can help an enterprise  to maintain  close
relationships  with its customers  by analyzing  their needs.
The decision  support  system consists  of the business  intelligence  (Bl) unit and the decision  support  system (DSS) for
providing  support  when making  decisions.  In both units, the backbone  is the enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW) that
collects  data internally  and externally  and analyzes  the data.
ITSM, the IT service manager,  leverages  the IT Infrastructure  Library (ITIL) in defining  the processes  and activities
of the IT services.  ITSM, when used in combination  with international  standards  like ISO/IEC 20000, can improve
and enhance  the quality of IT services.  It can also provide IT services  that will satisfy the users, but only when the
definitions  of service levels and the management  of service levels are installed  in advance.

A) Enterprise  solution
IT business  is a key enabler  of enterprise  competitiveness  and continuous  innovation. In the past, it was simply a tool
for supporting  business  activities,  but today it plays an important  role as a tool for survival  within a highly competitive
environment.
During the short 30-year  period since the introduction  of enterprise  computing  in the early 1980s, the power of
computers  has grown exponentially  and enterprises  have left many examples  of how computers  should be used in
the business  environment.  These examples  have now evolved  into formal solutions.
+ An “enterprise  solution”  is a collective  term for the information  systems  that support  the management  activities
which an enterprise  must perform in order to maximize  business  efficiency  and gain competitive  advantages  in its
business  environment.
+ The value and utility of an enterprise  solution  will vary depending  on the business processes  and activities  to be
defined,  and not by the function  provided  by the information  system.
+ Enterprise  solutions  are a broad concept  encompassing  advance  IT planning,  job specific solutions  that will be
configured  together  for building  a business  operation  system  using IT systems,  and maintenance&  repair for directly
operating  the aforementioned  IT system.
