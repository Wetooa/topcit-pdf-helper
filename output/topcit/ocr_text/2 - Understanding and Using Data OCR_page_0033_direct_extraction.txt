02 Object  Relational  Database
A) Object  relational  database  (ORDB)
@® Concept  of the object  relational  database
Even though the object-oriented  database  was introduced  to solve the weakness  of the relational  database
regarding  new advanced  applications,  it showed  certain limitations  in terms of its use in an enterprise  environment.
To overcome  this, the object relational  database  was introduced  by combining  the existing  relational  database  with
the concept  of the object-oriented  database  and expanding  its functions.  Currently,  most commercial  databases  are
object  relational  databases,  such as Oracle’s  Oracle9i,  IBM’s DB2 UDB, and Microsoft's  SQL Server.
@ Characteristics  of the object relational  database
The object relational  database  has the following  characteristics.
<Table 11> Characteristics  of the object  relational  database
Characteristic Description
Supports  user-defined  data types Users can define and use new types of data in addition  to basic data types.
Supports  the reference  typeData can be accessed  based on navigation  using the reference  structure  in such a
way that one object record refers to another  object record.
Supports  a nested  tableA data model with a complex  structure  can be designed  because  one column  ina
table is composed  of another  table.
Supports  large-scale  objectsSupports  LOB (Large Object)  as a basic data type for large-scale  unstructured
data such as images,  audio, and video
Supports  table inheritance  relationships
03 Understanding  KMLAccommodates  the advantages  of the object-oriented  database  by specifying  the
inheritance  relationship  between  tables.
A) Concept  and characteristics  of XML (Extensible  Markup  Language)
HTML (HyperText  Markup Language) is mainly used to create and format web documents  in a web environment,
but it remains  unsuitable  for specifying  structured  data extracted  from a database.  Therefore,  the World Wide Web
Consortium  (W3C) has developed  an extensible  markup language  (XML) as a standard  language  that is used to
structure  and exchange  data in a web environment.
XML has the following  characteristics,
© Simplicity:  XML can simplify  SGML (unused  functions  have been eliminated,  while major  functions  have been retained).
@ Openness:  XML can be used together  with HTML on the web, and can exchange  meta-data.
@ Scalability:  It can create its own tags and supports  self-description.
