+ Preview  for practical  business Establishing  a system for creating  a
reuse culture
Development  teams need to change their perception  and culture in order to incorporate  software
reuse into the development  process.  To reuse software,  developers  are required  to change  their way
of thinking,  and a new culture should be created  from the organization  and policy perspectives.  The
following  should be performed  to fully establish  the system.
- Composition  of the reuse management  organization:  The reuse management  organization  is
needed to establish  the reuse-based  method of software  development.  This organization  should
introduce  and establish  procedures  and standards  related  to reuse and enact and implement  a policy
for increasing  reusability.
- Training  on reuse: Training  on software  reuse should be conducted  on a regular basis to create an
atmosphere  or culture conducive  to software  reuse within the organization.  The training  should be
also provided  to project  managers  and organization  managers,  in addition  to developers.  In terms of
content,  the training  for managers  should differ from that intended  for developers.
- Introduction  of a reward system to increase  reusability:  Reuse may be perceived  with extreme
discomfort  when first introduced. Therefore,  a method should be devised  to increase reusability  by
policy. Introducing  an incentive  system  for reuse is the representative  method  in this regard.
- Securing  reliability  for reused components:  To make developers  trust reused components,  the
reliability  of the components  managed  in the reuse library should be sufficiently  guaranteed  and
measures  to help them find suitable  components  should be prepared,  in addition  to the change of
developer's  awareness.
