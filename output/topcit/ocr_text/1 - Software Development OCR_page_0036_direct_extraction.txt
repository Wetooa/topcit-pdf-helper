Software  Development )
@ Obstacles  to software  reuse and measures  to remove  the obstacles
+ Technical  plan
- Use of a new design and development  methodology.
- Development  of the reuse software  library.
- Use of the automation  tool (CASE).
+ Administrative  and institutional  methods
- Establishment  of a compensation  system.
- Active management  strategy.
- Organizational  change.
F) Considerations  when reusing  software
+ Reuse software  if productivity  can be improved.
+ Software  development  process  based on systematic  software  reuse.
+ Establishment  of a system  for promoting  a reuse culture.
+ Creation  of a reuse environment  through  initial investment.
* Continual  improvement  and enhancement  of the library.
+ Software  reuse that is supported  by tools.
+ Software  productivity  evaluation  and measures,
+ Management  of a set of information  on reused components.
+ Deliverables  for software  reuse:
Architecture,  source code, data, designs,  documents,  estimates  (templates),  human interfaces,  plans,
requirements,  test cases
+ Top-down/bottom-up  development  approach.
+ Granularity  of reusable  components.
G) Effects  of software  reuse
+ Reduces  the TCO of software  production.
* Creates  sharing  and utilization  effects  for producing  high-quality  software.
+ Promotes  the sharing of information  on system development  and the sharing of deliverables  from other
projects.
+ Has an educational  effect on the system  structure  and the method  of developing  a good system.
O2 Reverse  Engineering
A) Definition  of reverse  engineering
Reverse  engineering  is a field of software  engineering  in which a developed  system  is deconstructed  to reveal its documents,
design  techniques,  etc. Reverse  engineering  is a series of activities  aimed at understanding  and modifying  a system,  which
are performed  during  the software  maintenance  phase. That is, information  or a document  corresponding  to the deliverables
