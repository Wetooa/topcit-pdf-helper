D) Classification  of big data analytics
Big data analytics  refers to the process  of “discovering  meaningful  patterns  from big data.”

Concept Description
+ A statistical  technique  used to predict  the possibility  of an event’s  occurrence  (probabilityee) of occurrence)  using a linear combination  of independent  variables.
+ Amethod  of quantitative  analysis  that classifies  an interested  group into several
Decl  sont  eelaDal  si subgroups  or performs  Prediction  by drawing a decision tree chart.
+ Amethod  of analysis  that handles  a problem  with parallel/distributed/probabilistic
calculation  based on the idea that digital information  is a network  of nerve cells,
rather than a method  of processing  digital information  based on a deterministic  binary
computational  model using the human brain itself as the model.Neural network  analysis
+ A technology  that extracts  and processes  useful information  by applying  natural language
processing  technology  and document  processing  technology  to unstructured/semi-
Text mining structured  data.
+ The core technologies  of text mining  include  document  summarization,  document
classification, document  clustering,  and feature  extraction.
