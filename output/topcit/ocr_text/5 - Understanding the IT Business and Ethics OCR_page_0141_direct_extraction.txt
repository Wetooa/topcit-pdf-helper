These technologies  in combination  with services  such as social network  services,  augmented  reality, mobile games,
and advertising,  are boosting  the utilization  of the services.  Network-based  location detection  technologies  include
the following:
<Table71>  Network  based location  determination  technology
Category Description
A method  of calculating  the location  of a device by measuring  the location  value of the base
Cell ID/Sector  ID station and the distance between the base station and the device.
A method  of calculating  location  of a device by measuring  the angle of arrival of signals sent from
AoA (Angle of Arrival) each base station to the device and the location values of at least 2 base stations.
TDoA (Time difference  of | Amethod  of calculating  location  of a device by measuring  the time difference  of arrival of signals
Arrival) sent from each base station to the device and the location  values of at least 3 base stations.
Fingerprint/  Pattern A method  of calculating  the location  of a device by using the location information  of base station
Matching and the intensity  of the radio signal sent by the base station
With the advancements  in IT technology  and mobile communication  technology,  the technique  of location
determination  has also evolved.  In the 2G era, location  determination  was based on the principle  of simple cell-based
positioning.  But for 3G location  determination,  the Global Positioning  System (GPS) was adopted.  In the 4G era,
location  determination  has become  highly precise  with very narrow  error margins  because  the technology  has greatly
improved  the high error margins  that had been the weakness  of base stations  and the difficulty  of determining
positions  in indoor areas and areas with many impediments  to GPS. And wherever  an access  point (AP) exists,
location  determination  has become  possible  with Wi-Fi.
@ Mobile Commerce
Mobile technology  can be characterized  by 3 words: “Anytime”,  "Anywhere",  and "Any Device"  It is these characteristics
which has made mobile technology  the essential  backbone  of mobile businesses  from mobile based commerce  to
mobile based entertainment,  communication,  search, and location  information.
Mobile commerce  is mobile business  that utilizes  mobile devices  like smartphones,  tablets,  and smart pads for trading
goods, services,  and information
