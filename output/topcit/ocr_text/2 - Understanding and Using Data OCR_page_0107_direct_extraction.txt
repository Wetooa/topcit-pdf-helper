02 Data Definition  Language  (DDL)
A data definition  language  is used to describe  the database  schema in such a way that computers  can understand
it. Specifically,  it manages  the creation,  change, and deletion  of a table structure.  The main statements  of the data
definition  language  include  CREATE,  DROP. ALTER, and RENAME.
A) Types of data definition  language
@ CREATE:  Defining  and creating  an object
A table, view, index, schema,  function,  etc. can be defined using the CREATE  statement.  A primary  key and foreign
key can be defined  when creating  a table, and the object should not be the same as other created  objects.
@ ALTER: Changing  an object
Once  a table has been created,  it is best to keep its structure  intact. However,  it may be necessary  to add or delete
columns  and constraints  while using the table due to changes  in the work requirements  or the need for system
operation.  At this time, the structure  of the table can be changed  using the ALTER  statement.
© DROP: Deleting  an object
This command  is used to delete all data and structures  of the table when it has been created incorrectly  or is no
longer needed. However,  the referenced  constraint  related to the table concerned  should be deleted first before
deleting  a table. In Oracle, the CASCADE  CONSTRAINT  option can be used to delete it at the same time.
@ RENAME:  Changing  an object  name
This command  is used to change  the table name.
