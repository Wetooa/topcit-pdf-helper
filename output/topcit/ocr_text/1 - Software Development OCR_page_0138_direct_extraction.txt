A) Technology  trends  of software  development  tools
@ Highlighting  the cloud-based  integrated  development  environment
Integrated  development  environment  software  supports  all tasks related to programs  and development,  such
as coding, debugging,  compilation,  and deployment,  in one unified program  development  environment.  It has
been highlighted  as a development  tool capable  of meeting  the calls of open source and global IT companies
for rapid development.  This environment  is evolving  into a cloud-based  one, such as Codenvy,  GoormIDE,
and Cloud9,  which enables  development  regardless  of the location  and does not require the installation  of an
integrated  development  program.
@ Integrating  software  development  tools and ALM (Application  Lifecycle  Management)
Performance  management  tools, requirements  management  tools, issue management  tools, etc. that support
development  were designed  to manage  specific purposes  and specific steps. Since the introduction  of the
cloud, it has been evolving  into a tool that encompasses  development/test/operation  due to the complexity
of the infrastructure  and the market environment,  which demands  ever faster IT services.  The main purpose
of the performance  management  tool was to prevent  application  delays and improve  performance.  Recently,
such tools have been integrated  with ALM, which detects  changed  codes and manages  the changes,  and
supports  build/distribution  comprehensively.
B) Technology  trends  of programming  languages
® TypeScript,  an extended  version  of JavaScript
JavaScript  is one of the most popular  and powerful  programming  languages  in the world. It is often used to
make an interactive  web page by adding some effects to a web page, creating  a game, animation,  or drop-
down menu, and effectively  controlling  the web interface.  This programming  language  is basically  useful for
front-end  development  and is used by 88% of all websites.
Recently,  TypeScript  has been highlighted  as an extended  version  of JavaScript.  TypeScript  is an open source
project  created  by Microsoft  in 2012, and is used as the base language  of Angular.
+ Key features  of TypeScript
- It includes  the functions  of JavaScript  as it is based on JavaScript.
- Itis a “static type” language  that checks types at the time of compilation.
- It offers ease of compilation  in all browsers  and environments,  making  it highly useful.
- It enables  easy coding  and learning  because  everything  is a class or component.
- It is applicable  to large-size  application  programs.
