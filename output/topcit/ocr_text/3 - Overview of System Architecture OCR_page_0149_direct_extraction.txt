ESSENCE
indicates  the start of a frame, and destination  and source addresses,  which are physical  addresses.  Physical  addresses
have a 48-bit  address  system and have unique values  for each device, unlike logical IP addresses.  It is necessary
to use the physical  address  to check a device location below layer 2, since IP addresses  are used in layer 3. Trailers
include  a frame check sequence  (FCS) to check  for errors during a data transfer.
03 Datalink  Layer Configuration
A) Sub-layers  of datalink  layer
A datalink  layer consists  of two sub-layers:  an LLC (Logical  Link Control)  sub-layer  and a MAC (Media Access  Control)
sub-layer.  The LLC sub-layer  is responsible  for the connection  between  the MAC sub-layer  and the network  layer
(layer 3). The lower MAC sub-layers  are responsible  for control according  to the topology  on physical layers  or other
characteristics.

[Figure 106] IEEE 802.3 Frame Structure
The sub-layer  is located at a higher level among the sub-layers  of the datalink  layer. It is responsible  for the data
transfer  between  two adjacent  nodes on the IEEE 802.2 or datalink layer network.  The adjacent  nodes have the
destination  service access  point (DSAP) and the source service  access point (SSAP) on the LLC layer. The LLC layer
can use various  MAC sub-layer  protocols  to facilitate  the communication,  regardless  of the network  topology.
