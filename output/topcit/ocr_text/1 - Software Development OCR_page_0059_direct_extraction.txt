[Figure  12] Type and degree  of coupling
@ Data coupling
+ Data coupling  refers to coupling  when the interface  between  modules  is composed  of data elements  only.
+A module passes data as a parameter  or argument  while calling another  module, whereupon  the called
module  returns  the processing  result of the received  data.
+ Data coupling  does not have to know the contents  between  modules  at all. It is the most desirable  coupling,
as changes  in one module do not affect another  module  at all.
@ Stamp coupling
+ Stamp coupling  refers to coupling  in which a data structure  such as an array or record is passed over to the
interface  between  modules.
+ In stamp coupling,  two modules  retrieve  the same data structure.  If the data structure  is changed, that is,
if the format or structure  is changed,  all modules  that do retrieve it, along with the module that does not
actually  retrieve  the changing  field, are affected.
© Control  Coupling
+ Control  coupling  refers to coupling  in which a control element  (function  code, switch, tag, flag) used to control
a logical flow is transferred  from one module  to another.
+ It occurs when the parent module knows and controls  the detailed  processing  procedure  of the child module
or when the processing  functions  are split into two modules  in the design.
@ External  coupling
+ External  coupling  refers to coupling  in which data (variables)  declared  externally  by one module  are referenced
by another  module.
* Each module  can limit the scope of referenced  data.
@® Common  coupling
+ Common  coupling  refers to coupling  in which several modules  share a common  data area.
* Common  coupling  weakens  modules’  independence  because  any changes  to the common  data area affect all
of the modules  that use the common  data.
© Content  coupling
+ Content  coupling  refers to coupling  in which one module directly  refers to or modifies  the internal  function  or
internal  data of another  module.
+ When one module  is branched  into the middle  of another  module,  it is also content  coupling.
