@ Effects  of SLA deployment
+ Seamless  communication:  Used as a communication  tool between  consumers  and suppliers  of services.
+ Prevention  of conflicts:  Narrows  the expectation  gap (vs reality) for service levels and lays the foundation  for
resolving  the gap.
* Objective  evaluation:  An objective  and quantitative  evaluation  of service  quality is possible.
+ Continuous  control: Provides  a control  system  for managing  services.
@ Component  elements  of the SLA and the metric  for each item
An SLA sets the service target levels for service level management  metrics, provides  performance measurement
standards  for the objectives  of the service,  and has a system  for reporting  service levels.
<Table 52> Component  elements  of the SLA
Component  elements Description
Provides  performance  metrics  for quantitatively  judging a service  levels (i.e. each serviceService  Level Metrics
area).
Establishes  the standards  of the service. For example,  the target level and the minimum
level of the service  level management  metric. Imposes  penalties  when the service  level
falls short of the target, and provides  incentives  when the service  level exceeds  the
target.Service  Level Objectives
Method  of quantitatively  measuring  the pre-defined  service  level metrics  (includesService  Level Measurements ae ‘imeasuring  interval,  measuring  team, frequency  of measurement,  etc.)
Service  Level Reports Format  and method  of reporting  the service level used in the communication  system
Some examples  of metrics  defined in the SLA are shown in the table below. In particular,  the items described  using
metrics  are also called “service  level items” or “configuration  items’ (Cl).
<Table 53> Examples  of SLA metrics
