O2 Understanding  of Copyright
A) Definition  and Classification  of Copyright
@ Definition  of Copyright
Copyright  is a right arising to a person who created a work, and generally  refers to an exclusive  right granted to
the author  of a work by law. The copyright  applies from the time the work is created,  and follows the non-formality
principle,  meaning  that it is automatically  generated  even without  formal requirements  or registration  procedures  for

Author's  economic  rights include  the right of reproduction,  performance,  broadcasting,  transmission  rights, exhibition,
distribution,  production  of derivative  works.
