G) Understanding  PLM
Product  lifecycle management  (PLM) is a product  life cycle management  solution.  It is a production/design  process
that increases  a product’s  added value and reduces  costs by uniformly  managing  the entire process  from creation  of
the product  design drawings  to production  of the final product.  PLM provides  product  information  data management
server  system,  both of which are related to the product  life cycle and the network  of multiple  client systems.
@ Definition  of PLM
PLM can be defined as a support  system that integrates  and manages  information  related to products  - such as
drawings,  documents,  CAD/CAM  information, basic parts information,  design changes,  and process  information.  These
forms of information  are generated  throughout  the entire product  life cyclesof  the products  that are developed  and
manufactured  by an enterprise.
@ Configuration  of PLM
Recently,  PLM has come to be understood  as a concept  that includes  not only product  planning,  but also the post-
sales services  provided  to customers.  Managing  the entire cycle of an individual  product  from the planning  stage
until it is sold is the key role of PLM. However,  organic  support  from other work support  systems  is a prerequisite  for
fulfilling  this role. To understand  the components  of PLM, it is sometimes  helpful to visualize  the flow of a product's
entire life cycle.
