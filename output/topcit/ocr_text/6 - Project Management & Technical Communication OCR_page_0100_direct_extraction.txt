<Table 45> Result  of Backward  Scheduling  by Activity
Activity  Name LS (Late Start) Duration LF (Late Finish)
: 9(10-1)A 13-3 + 1) 3 3(4-1)
B 10(11-2 +  1) 2 11(12-1)
G 12(13-2 + 1) 2 13(14-1)
_ 11(12-1)D 4(7-4 + 1) 4 7(8-1)
E 8(13-6 + 1) 6 13(14-1)
F 14(16-3  + 1) 3 16
For Activity  “F’, there is no LS of successor  activity,  so LF starts with 16.
In the case of Activity  “D’, there are two successor  activities:  “C” and “E”. In this case, the “C’” and “E” activities
can start only after the “D’ activity  ends. The “C’ activity  must start on the 12th at the latest (LS, Late Start),
and the “E” activity  must start on the 8th at the latest.
Therefore,  Activity  “D’ must finish on the 7th at the latest (Late Finish), and the faster “E” of the two activities
can start normally  on the 8th. So, the LF of Activity  “D’ becomes  8 (LS of Activity  “E”) - 1 = 7. Subsequently,
the LS of Activity  “D’ also becomes  7 - 4 + 1 = 4. After calculating  both the LS and LF of the individual
activities,  write them as shown in the figure below.

[Figure  32] Critical Path Method@  (Example)
@ Total Float, Critical Path Calculation
The formula  for calculating  Total Float for each activity  is as follows:
+ TF = LF - EF or
+ TF=LS-ES
The reason for calculating  Total Float is to determine  the critical path. In other words, the critical path is a path
that connects  activities  whose Total Float is “zero”. Therefore,  the critical path in this example  becomes  “A-D-
E-F’ indicated  in red as shown in the figure below.
