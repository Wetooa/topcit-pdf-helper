B) Spring  Framework
@ Introduction  to the Spring  Framework
The Spring Framework  is an open-source application  framework  for the Java platform,  which provides  a
comprehensive  basic structure  for the development  of Java-based  enterprise  applications,  and various  services
necessary  for dynamic  web application  development.  The Spring Framework  is utilized as a core basis for the
standard  e-government  development  framework  on account  of its proven stability  and flexibility.
@ Characteristics  of the Spring Framework
The Spring Framework  uses  a lightweight  container  called POJO (Plain Old Java Object) to manage  the life
cycle of the Java object, such as creation  and destruction,  and guarantees  loose coupling  between  objects by
using DI (Dependency  Injection),  which sets the dependency  relationship  between  objects using configuration
files or annotations.  It also uses AOP (Aspect-Oriented  Programming)  to support  the combination  of functions
that are commonly  used in multiple  modules,  but which are not related to core business  logic, such as logging,
security, transactions,  etc., if they are executed  after separation.  In addition,  it provides  database  libraries  such
as JDBC, MyBatis,  Hibernate,  JPA, etc., and supports  the interface  with various  APIs necessary  for developing
enterprise  applications  such as JMS, mail, and scheduling.
