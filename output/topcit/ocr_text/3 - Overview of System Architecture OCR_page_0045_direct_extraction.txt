@ Input/output  system  management
The OS helps users use a device, even if they do not know its characteristics.  Here, a device refers to an input/output
device and includes  a mouse,  keyboard, printer, and speaker. Users can easily use these devices with the functions
provided  by the OS.
© Auxiliary  memory  unit management
The volume of data used by a computer  system is growing  larger, from gigabytes  and even to terabytes.  However,
the data used by a computer's  CPU is that which is in the main memory  unit. The main memory  does not provide  the
capacity  at the terabyte  level. The OS hands the following  auxiliary  memory  unit management  function  to store the
managed  data:
- Empty  space management
~ Storage  allocation
~ Disk scheduling
© Networking
A distributed  system is a set of memory  units or separate  processors.  Each processor  communicates  at a high speed
through  the network.  The network  integrates  scattered  computer  resources  into a system  to improve  the calculation
speed, share data, and to enhance  reliability.
@ Command-interpreter  system
A command-interpreter  system is one of the system programs  that enables  users to access  the main OS functions.
In MS-DOS  of UNIX shell, a user can enter a command  with a keyboard  in order to run an OS function.
