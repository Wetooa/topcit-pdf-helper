within the buffer. The data transfer  time indicates how long it takes to transfer  the read data to the main memory.
The access time is the sum of the seeking  time, the rotational  latency, and the data transfer  time. This section
describes  techniques  to minimize  the access  time by minimizing  the seeking  time and the rotational  latency.
@ First come first serve (FCFS) disk scheduling
FCFS services  the requests  in the order they are received.  The head position moves in the order of the requested
tracks in the disk standby  queue. It is easy to program  and provides  fair service to all requests.  However,  the head
movement  may be inefficient,  and it can unnecessarily  increase  the response  time. The execution  sequence  does not
change,  even when it receives  a priority  request.

@ Shortest seeking time first (SSRF) disk scheduling |
The scheduling  technique  first services  the request  that is closest  to the current  head position,  among  the requested
services  waiting  in the queue. It minimizes  head movement  because  it takes a lot of time to move the head in the
disk drive. It maximizes  the service response  rate per unit time by minimizing  the head movement  in order to process
the queue requests.  The response  time variation  can increase  depending  on where the requested  input or output
data is on the disk. It can cause starvation  for the requests  seeking  data that are positioned  in the inner or outer
cylinder. It offers a higher processing  rate and a shorter  mean response  time than FCFS.
