Technologies  that make up smart grids can be largely  grouped  under smart grid platforms  and smart  grid applications.
The platform  has intelligent  devices, bi-directional  communication  and sophisticated  control system for managing
distributed  and intelligent  power  grid. The platform  is configured  to operate  renewable  energy  applications,  intelligent
electric  vehicle charging  stations,  smart metering  applications,  power grid monitoring  applications,  demand  response
applications.  Intelligent  storage  devices have electronic  sensor and meters that monitor  the current state of the
smart  grid and has digital intelligent  devices  that can make basic decisions  on their own.
The IT infrastructure  attached  to the power  grid act as the IT elements  that are critical to the operation  of the smart
grid. It optimizes  energy efficiency  and gets people to consume  energy  through  bi-directional  exchange  of real time
information  (about the supply and demand  for electricity).  Therefore,  the smart grid must be equipped  with open
system networks  and protocols  so that its value-added  services  could create new products,  services,  and markets
and not limited to just providing  power. The communication  infrastructure  should provide end-to-end  services
between  intelligent  devices and maintain a reliable and steady supply of electric power. Furthermore,  development
must abide by standards  to support  interoperability  for various  interfaces.

Microgrid  is an extension  of a smart grid. The US Department  of Energy (DOE) defines a microgrid  as "a group of
interconnected  consumers  and distributed  energy  resources  (DERs) under a clearly  defined  electrical  specifications  that
can be controlled  by the system  as a single entity  and that could be connected  to the system  or made independent.”
An easy way to understand  micro grid is to view it as a power grid constructed  for a local area that connects
electricity  users with distributed  energy resources  such as wind and solar power. It is a power grid that can make a
grid owner become  self-sufficient  in power by operating  independently  of existing  electric  grid and still connect  to the
regular  grid when necessary.  In South Korea, microgrid  pilot testings  are underway  in Jeju Island's  smart  grid complex,
Gapado,  Marado,  and Ulleungdo.
