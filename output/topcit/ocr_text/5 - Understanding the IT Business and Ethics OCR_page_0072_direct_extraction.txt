Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
Faced with the increasing  complexity  and scale of enterprise  information  systems  and the growing  need for the
systemized  management  of information  resources,  enterprises  have become  dependent  on IRM because  it provides
a common  standard  and management  system for the entire range of informatization  procedures  (informatization
planning,  development,  and performance  evaluation).
The IRM informs  the EA of its framework  for information  resources,  and the EA presents  the IRM with guidelines  for
enterprise  resource  schemes  and reference  schemes.  That is, IRM and EA exist in a complementary  relationship.

05 IT Business  Process  Improvement  Techniques
Improving  business  processes  is seen as an essential  means of securing  competitiveness  in a rapidly changing
business  environment.  All enterprises  are committed  to maximizing  their operational  efficiency  by structuring  their
organizations in order to respond  quickly  to the market environment  and gain price competitiveness  over their
competitors. They also focus on technology  innovations  for the purpose  of developing  new business  models and
services.
To realize these business  objectives,  enterprises  try to improve themselves  by adopting  a number  of innovation
techniques.  Despite  these efforts, many companies  often suffer from weakened  market competitiveness  and
economic  losses. This is because  the larger the scale of the enterprise  or the number  of employees,  the harder it
becomes  to manage  the organization,  while the ways in which business  tasks are carried out in practice  often contain
unrealistic  or inefficient  elements.  Innovative  techniques  such as BPR and PI described  below, along with management
tools like 6 Sigma, are being used strategically  by enterprises  as a means of improving  their business  processes.
