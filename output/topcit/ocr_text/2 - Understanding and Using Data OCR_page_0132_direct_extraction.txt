01 Concept  of Database  Failure  and Recovery
A) Definition  of data recovery
Data recovery  refers to the restoration  of the consistency  and integrity  of a database  before the occurrence  of an
unexpected  (database)  failure while operating  the database.
B) Types of database  failures
<Table 54> Types of database  failures
Type Main content
Transaction + Logical error: A transaction  cannot be completed  due to an internal error.
failure + System error: An active transaction  is terminated  by force due to error conditions  such as deadlock.
+ Failure  of power, hardware,  software,  etc.
+ Checks  integrity  to ensure that the stored contents  are not affected  by system  failure.
+ When a part or all of the disk storage  is broken.
+ Re-executes  transactions  (redo) that were completed  after dumping,  using the most recent  dump and log.
+ Occurs  due to the users’ lack of understanding  of the database.
+ DBA’s mistakes  made while managing  the database.System  failure
Disk failure
User failure
C) Basic principles  of database  recovery:  Principle  of information  redundancy
@ Archive  or dump: Copy and store a database  to another  storage  device.
@ Log or  journal:  Record  the old values and new values of changing  data each time a database  is changed.
D) Types of database  recovery  actions
@ Redo: Archive  copy + log => Status after commit
+ If the contents  of the database  itself are damaged,  the most recent copy is loaded, and any changes  made after
making  the copy are read from the log and executed  again so that the contents  of the database  can be restored.
+ This corresponds  to the completed  transaction  at the time of failure occurrence.
+ Changed  values are stored in a disk (forward  recovery)  by executing  the write operation  again.
@ Undo: Log + backward  cancellation  operation  => Start status
+ If contents  that are being changed  or have been changed  cannot be trusted even though the contents  of the
database  itself have not been damaged,  the database  is restored  to its original state by cancelling  all changes.
+ This corresponds  to the transaction  in progress  at the time of failure occurrence  (incomplete  transaction).
+ Previous  values are restored  by cancelling  the write operation  (backward  recovery).
