The “normalization”  theory is the foundation  of completing  a system and is one of the most important
theories  that need to be understood  when building  a system in the field. The theory  of first normalization  is
the starting  point for normalization,  which removes  duplication  from a file system  in order that data can be
processed  stably. This situation  occurs frequently  in the actual project site, so it is necessary  to learn the
details in depth. The first, second,  and third Boyce-Codd  normalizations  are performed  based on function
dependency,  whereas  the fourth and fifth normalizations  are performed by  the semantic  association
between  attributes.  Data should be managed  stably when building  a system.  Normalization  is an important
theory that everyone  should know when developing  an information  system, because  normalization  is the
most important  and basic theory  for ensuring  stable data management.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain the concept  and characteristics  of file dependency.
2. To be able to explain abnormal  normalization.
3. To be able to design a database  by applying  normalization.
4. To be able to explain denormalization.
5. To be able to explain the points to be taken into consideration  for performance  design.
+ Normalization  removes  anomalies  by removing  data redundancy.
+ Denormalization  is a design technique  for improving  query performance,
