[Figure 14] Cardinality  of the relationship
@ The relationship  connecting  the weak entity and the identifying  entity is called an “identifying  relationship”  and is
distinguished  from the general  relationship  by marking  it with a two-line  diamond.
C) Attribute
@ An attribute  represents  the intrinsic  nature of an entity or relationship  and is represented  using an ellipse.
@ Identifier  (key attribute)
+ Anidentifier  is represented  by underlining  the attribute’s  name.
+ An attribute  or a set of attributes  that always has a unique value in all entity sets (e.g. student ID, vehicle
registration  number,  etc.)
+ When an identifier  is made by combining  several attributes,  the attributes  concerned  are combined  first to make a
complex  attribute,  and are then marked  by underlining  it.
+ If there are multiple  attributes  that can be an identifier,  mark all of them by underlining  them.
@ Weak entity separator  (partial key attribute)
As a weak entity does not have an identifier,  it should be connected  to another  entity that plays the role of an
identifying  entity, and the identifier  of the identifying  entity and some attributes  of the weak entity are combined  to be
used as the identifier.  The attributes  of the weak entity used at this time are called separator  or partial key attributes.
@ Multi-valued  attribute
A multi-valued  attribute  can have multiple  values at the same time, which are distinguished  from general attributes
(single-valued  attribute)  by marking  them with a two-line  ellipse
© Derived  attribute
A derived  attribute  refers to an attribute  that can be derived  from other stored data and is distinguished  from general
attributes  (storage  attribute)  by marking  it with a dotted ellipse.
Example)  The number  of people in each department  can be derived by counting  the number  of employees  in the
department.
