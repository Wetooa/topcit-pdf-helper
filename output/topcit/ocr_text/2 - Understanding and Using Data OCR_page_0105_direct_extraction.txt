Since most of the recent information  systems  store data in a database,  an adequate  database  processing
language  is needed  to process  values by linking a program  to a database.  In particular,  as more than 90%
of the databases  adopted  by a project  are mostly  relational  databases  in the majority  of cases, developers
should be familiar with the relational  database  language.  So how well should developers  familiarize
themselves  with the relational  database  language?  Objects  such as tables and views are managed  by the
data architect  (DA) or the database  administrator  (DBA) in some large-scale  projects;  however,  developers
manage  everything  from table creation/change/delete  to data processing  in most projects.  Therefore,
it is desirable  for the developer  to know all of the data definition  language  (DDL), data control language
(DCL), and data manipulation  language  (DML) of the relational  database,  in order to perform those tasks
smoothly.  That is, relational  database  languages  are one of the key database  build and operation  areas that
developers  should know well, and it is recommended  for developers  to learn those languages  to such a level
that they can use the syntax  quite freely,
