ESSENCE
Refactoring  is performed  for the following  reasons.
+ Refactoring  makes error detection  and debugging  easier.
+ Changes  in software  requirements  can be responded  to more effectively.
+ Complex  code is simplified,  and source code readability  is improved.
+ Program  productivity  and quality are improved.
@ Time for refactoring  and procedure
* Codes are written first without  plans, and the second similar codes are written in duplication.  However,
refactoring  is performed  when writing the third similar codes. Therefore,  it is important  to decide on the time
to perform  refactoring.
+ Refactoring  is generally  performed  when the time taken to add a new function  to the existing  code is inefficient:
when the design changes  in such a way that addition  is not easy; when eliminating  bugs; or when reviewing  codes.
+ Refactoring  procedure
<Table 34> Refactoring  procedure
Target  selection Maintenance,  inspection,  and XP methodology  application
aac Including  a senior who plays the role of a mentor
Performance  control Change  control,  configuration  management,  CCB control
Performing  technique Design pattern,  AOP execution
Testing Unit/integration  test, regression  test
Result arrangement Documentation,  actualization,  application  of the operating  system
+ When performing  refactoring,  it is necessary  to make small-scale  changes  (single refactoring)  and test
whether  it works. If it works well, one can proceed  to the next factoring  phase. If not, it is necessary  to solve
the problem,  undo the refactoring  work, and then keep the system running.
B) Concept  of a code smell
@® Concept  of a code smell
The term “code smell’ means the code to be refactored,  such as a program  that is difficult  to read or has
duplicated  logic, which makes it difficult  for developers  to read or maintain  it. A code smell is the part that is
difficult  to understand,  modify  or expand.  If it is difficult  to read the code, refactoring  should be considered.
@ Common  code smells
Type Description
Duplicate  code Functions  or data codes are written  in duplication.
Long method The inside of the method  is too long.
Vast class One class has too many properties  and methods.
Long parameter  list A method  has too many parameters.
Class modified  for two If the method  of one class is modified  for more than two reasons,  the class is responsible  for
reasons more than one job.
