C) IP-SAN
@ Concept  of IP-SAN
This type of SAN uses the gigabit  Ethernet  Internet  protocol  (IP), instead of a fiber channel.  While the SAN requires
a SAN switch and SAN storage  disks, it increases  interconnectivity,  since it is connected  using the existing  Ethemet
network.  It can unify the network  management  and overcome  the distance  limitation  of SAN, since it can use an IP
IP-SAN  includes  FCIP, iFCP, and iSCSI, while iSCSI is the most widely-used  type.
@ Fiber Channel  over IP (FCIP)
FCIP is used to connect  a remote  SAN. It encapsulates  data to TCP/IP  for interconnection  when transferring  a frame
to a remote location.  It groups the scattered  SANs into a massive  fiber channel  fabric. A failure of a SAN can affect
SANs in other regions  included  in the fabric.

iFCP provides  a TCP/IP connection  dedicated  to regional  SAN, using the iFCP gateway.  Unlike FCIP a SAN failure does
not affect SAN in other regions,  since it does not create a massive  fabric. Since it converts  protocols  using a gateway
and can be implemented  without  changing  the infrastructure,  it provides  highly compatible  interconnectivity  in both
hardware  and software.
