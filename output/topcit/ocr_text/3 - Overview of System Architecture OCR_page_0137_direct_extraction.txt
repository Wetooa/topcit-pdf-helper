+ Support  for application  container:  Application-specific  container  configuration  support
OS-level  virtualization  has the following  disadvantages:
+ Host OS-dependent
+ Not possible  to configure  the kernel for each container
04 Storage  and Network  Virtualization  Technologies
A) Storage  virtualization
It enables  service  implementation  by virtually  allocating  only the minimum  space initially required,  with thin-
provisioning  technology,  instead of configuring  the required  storage space. Moreover,  it provides  an environment  to
use heterogeneous  storage  system integration.
B) Network  virtualization
It implements  L2, L3, and L7 switches,  network  firewalls,  and security  devices  that existed in the form of hardware
appliances  as virtual machines.  It enables  networking  resources  to operate  separately  through  internal virtualization,
even in a shared physical  environment.
05 Cloud Platform
A) Definition  of cloud platform
A cloud platform is a cloud operation system to collect, control, and operate resources,  such as servers,  storage,
networks,  and virtualization  technologies.
B) Openstack
Openstack  is an open-source  project that develops  all software  blocks needed to build public and private cloud
computing  platforms.  It also refers to the community  of open-source  developers,  enterprises, and users that want to
implement  and operate  cloud computing  with open source. Moreover,  Openstack  establishes  industry  standards  for
cloud computing  platforms,  independent  of the equipment  type or vendor's  implementation  technology.
@ Main Openstack  projects
+ Nova: The core component  for automatic  control and the operation  of large-scale  virtual computer  instances
+ Swift: Implementation  of large-scale,  reliable  cloud object storage  services
+ Glance: Storage,  registration,  management,  and delivery  of virtual disk image files
+ Keystone:  Integrated  authentication  and authority  system
+ Cinder: Volume  replication,  snapshot  support,  and block storage
