>> Recent  trends and major issues
The data modeling  technique  represented  by individual  entities  and relationships  has been used widely. In
recent times, however,  there has been an increase  in practical business  techniques  that try to express  the
composition  or workflow  of a business  more elaborately  in terms of the data modeling  expression  method.
Among  these, the extended  data model supplements  the shortcomings  of the traditional  data model which
expresses  the composition  with simple entities  and relationships  only and has the strengths  of the object-
oriented  data model. This model expresses  the object-oriented  inheritance  structure as a super-type  and
a sub-type  of data modeling,  and designates  a grouping  type that has multiple  attribute  values in a single
entity. An analysis  of commonly  implemented  projects  showed  that about 70% of them use the super-type
and sub-type  method.  As a result, even though  data modeling  is deployed,  there are many cases in which
the physical  data model is created  without  a clear standard.  Therefore,  concrete  data modeling  techniques,
which developer  can understand  accurately  and apply to practical  business,  need to be acquired  and applied
in the field.
Actually,  if the following  knowledge  and techniques,  which are frequently  mentioned  in actual projects,  are
known or learned,  they can be applied usefully.
- It is essential  to fully know and apply the normalization  rules, which are the starting  point of creating  a
database.
- Do not casually  think that inquiry performance  is slow in normalized  models.
- Denormalization  technology  should be applied  based on a proper  understanding.
- Auser-independent  conceptual  schema should be applied to data modeling  from the viewpoint  of data
independence.
- The meaning  and effect of identifier  relationships  and non-identifier  relationships  should be understood
before applying  them.
- Conversion  should be performed  after understanding  the concepts  of super-type  and sub-type  and after
considering  performance.
- Do not create a data model with a missing  relationship.
- History  data modeling  (occurrence,  change,  progress)  in consideration  of performance  should be available.
- When setting  primary  keys, the performance  and index characteristics  should be considered.
