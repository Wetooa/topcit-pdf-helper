Detailed  Method  of Writing  by Item
+ Purpose: It should be well described  in one or two sentences  about why this work is done and why this
proposal  is made.
+ Status/Issue:  Since general plans are for improvement  purposes,  in order to achieve the  purpose,  the
current  situation  and the issue/cause  should be well described.
+ Improvement  plan: Describe  the solution  to the problem  raised in the current  situation/issue.  In this case, it
is good to use a table. In particular,  depending  on the nature of the document,  there are many cases where
the manager  chooses  between  <Plan 1> and <Plan 2> based on the strengths  and weaknesses.  In this
case, it is good to use a table to describe  the contents,  strengths,  and weaknesses  of each section.
+ Schedule:  Organized  to describe  schedule  and major issues for each item
+ Attachment:  If there are attachments,  number  them as 1, 2, etc. E.g. 1. One copy of Reward  Recipient  List, 2.
One copy of Public Record
+ End: The word “End” indicates  that the document  is over. If there is no attachment,  you can mark the end
two spaces apart from the last letter of the document,  and if the table is the last part of the document,
mark it at the bottom left of the table. If there is an attachment,  you can mark it two spaces apart from
the last letter of the attachment.
