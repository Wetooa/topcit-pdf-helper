F) Utilization  of data structures
Data structures  are mainly used in data sorting, search, file organization,  and index. The utilization  fields by data
structure  can be summarized  as follows.
@ List: Array implementation,  DBMS index, problems  such as search or sorting,  etc.
@ Stack: Interrupt  handling,  sequence  control of the recursive  program,  saving the retum address  of the subroutine,
calculating  an expression  represented  in postfix  notation,  undo function  of the text editor, etc.
@® Queue: Job scheduling  of the operating  system,  queue processing,  asynchronous  data exchange  (file I/O, pipes,
sockets),  keyboard  buffer use, spool operation,  etc.
@ Deque: A data structure  that makes the most of the strengths  of the stack and queue only, and which is mostly
used in the fields related  to the stack and queue.
© Tree: Problems  like search and sorting,  grammar  parsing,  Huffman  code, decision  trees, games,  etc.
© Graph: Computer  network  (local area network,  internet,  web, etc.), electric circuit analysis,  binary relation,
simultaneous  equations,  etc.
02 Algorithm
A) Algorithm  overview
@ Algorithm  definition
An algorithm  is a description  of a series of processing  procedures  used to solve a given problem  by stages.  It is
a specification  that logically  describes  a step-wise  procedure  by abstracting  the problem-solving  method.  The
algorithm  is not designed simply to obtain the desired result, but also to develop  an efficient  method in terms
of processing  time and storage  space use.
@ Conditions  of algorithms
<Table 12> Conditions  of algorithms
Condition Description
Input More than one data that are needed  to execute  an algorithm  should be entered  from outside.
Output More than one result should be output after executing  an algorithm.
7 Instructions  for each processing  step of the algorithm,  indicating  the content  and sequence  of the jobDefiniteness ;to perform,  should be clearly specified.
Finiteness An algorithm  must be terminated  after execution
