F) Checklist  for business  documents
Good quality business  documents  cannot be produced  unless the final inspection procedure  for business  doc-
uments is conducted  from the  objective  perspective  of a third party. To do this, it is necessary  to compare
and review whether  your document  conforms  to the requirements  described  in the checklist  below after writ-
ing the document.

G) Use of business  documentation  tools
Commonly  used commercial  tools for writing business  documents  include word processors  (HWP, MS Word),
presentation  tools (MS PowerPoint,  Prezi), and spreadsheets  (MS Excel, Google Spreadsheet).  These tools
support  many functions  that can meet the requirements  of business  documents,  so knowing  how to use them
well comes in handy.
@ Word Processor
It is a tool that is commonly  used to create relatively  lengthy  documents  such as outputs  of specific  work,
minutes,  and manuals.  It has a standardized  structure of  table of contents,  and each table of contents  has a
tree structure  for each level. The main functions  are the insertion  of tables and pictures,  and maintenance  of
the layout structure.
