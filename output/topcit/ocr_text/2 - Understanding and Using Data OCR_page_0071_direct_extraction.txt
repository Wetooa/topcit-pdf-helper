O2 Concept  of Functional  Dependency  and Rule of Inference
The anomalies  described above can be prevented  by decomposing  each table based on specific  criteria. Functional
dependency  is one of the most useful criteria that can be applied when decomposing  a table in this way and is
expressed  as the relationship  between  a determinant  and a dependent.  Additional  functional  dependency  can be
inferred  based on the previously  discovered  functional  dependency.  At this time, Armstrong’s  Axioms  are used.
A) Functional  dependency
@ Definition:  There are the subsets X and Y of the field defined in the table R. At this time, if the values of X of the
arbitrary  record pair t1 and t2 are the same, and the Y values of those two records  are always the same, Y is functionally
dependent  on X.
@ Expression:  X >Y (Dependent  Y is functionally  dependent  on determinant  X.)
+ (Example)  (Resident  registration  number)  — (Name)
+ If the resident  registration  numbers  of two records  are the same in the table about people, it means  that the names
of these two records  are always the same.
