Now, it’s time to start creating  a program  structure  centered  on the data flow. The guidelines  needed  to create
a transform-based  program  structure  are based on identifying  the input flow, transform  center, and output  flow
of the data flow diagram.  Mapping  the structure  table in the data flow diagram  is performed  by the guidelines.
Three components  can be found if the root program structure is created in the transform  flow-oriented  data
flow diagram.  The three components  are as follows.
+ Input control module,  which processes  input.
+ Transform  control module,  which processes  transform.
+ Output  control module,  which processes  output.
The input control module receives  input data from the lower-level  modules  and sends them to the upper-level
module.  If necessary,  the input data are refined and transmitted  to the upper level. The output control module
receives  output  data from the upper level and sends them to the lower-level  modules.  If necessary,  this module
also refines  the output  flow and transmits  it to the lower-level  module.
The number  of control modules  is subject to system complexity,  and the number  of control modules  that
process  transform  is determined  by transform  centered  complexity.  The figure below shows a simple program
structure  based on transform.
