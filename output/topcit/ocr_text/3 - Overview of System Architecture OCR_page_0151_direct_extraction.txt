[Figure 108] ARP packet structure
The ARP packet is organized  of the 6-byte destination  MAC address,  6-byte source MAC address,  2-byte Ethernet
protocol  type, 2-byte hardware  type, 2-byte protocol  type, 1-byte hardware  address  length, 1-byte protocol  address
length, 2-byte operation  code, 6-byte sender hardware  address,  4-byte sender  protocol  address,  6-byte target
hardware  address,  4-byte  target protocol  address,  and 18-byte  padding.
B) MAC address  search scenario
Since Router  C and computer  with user A are in the same network  section,  with user A, as shown in [Figure 103], the
MAC address  is required  for communication.  In that case, the computer  with user A sends an ARP request  through
broadcasting  to all systems  in the network  section. The data section of the frame, transferred  through the ARP
request,  contains  the ARP packet, as shown in [Figure 108]. On receiving  the response,  router C transfers  its MAC
address  in the ARP packet  to the computer  with user A through  unicast,  to find each other's  MAC address.  The MAC
address  is stored in each system's  cache memory.  In that case, wired/wireless  router B stores the port-MAC  address
table of the system  connected  to its cache memory  ports.
05 Techniques  of Datalink  Layer error Detection  and Correction
A) Concept  of error control
Transferring  frames through  the data link layer can cause various  errors, depending  on the network  condition  or the
operation  of the transmitting  and receiving  device. Types of errors include single-bit  errors, in which only one bit of
the data part is changed,  multi-bit  errors, in which two or more non-contiguous  bits are changed  in the data unit, and
burst errors, in which two or more consecutive  bits are changed.
Error control is the function  of detecting  and correcting  errors when transmitted  data does not arrive properly,  or
when an error occurs during transmission.  Error control methods  can be divided into two types, as shown in [Figure
