>> Recent  trends and major issues
According  to the annual White Paper on the Data Industry  published  by the Korea Data Agency,  the
domestic  data-related  market is showing  a steady growth trend. The trend also shows that interest  in
the diversity  and availability  of data is increasing  significantly.  Considering  this trend, the fields of data
utilization,  database  construction,  and data solutions  seem to be maintaining  a steady rate of growth
in all industries  in Korea. It is also obvious  that personnel  requirements  in the related fields will increase
significantly  in the coming  years. Likewise,  we can anticipate  the main trends of business,  such as the
spread of the cloud platform  to the data environment,  increased  interest  in data quality management,  and
increased  decision-making  based on data. Judging  from these trends, it is evident  that competence  related
to the processing  and utilization  of data is becoming  increasingly  important.
