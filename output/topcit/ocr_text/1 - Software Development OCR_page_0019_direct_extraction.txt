As such, even though software  is prone to be defective  due to its intrinsic nature, the domestic
software  industry  tends to overlook  it on such pretexts  as a lack of budget or a shortage  of
manpower.  One can understand  their view that they don’t have any other options. It is natural
that the software  development  period and cost increase  when quality is taken into account.  This
phenomenon  is further aggravated  by continuous  issues that have been pointed  out for a long time,
but which still have not been resolved,  namely, the difficulty  of getting  the right software  price, the
lack of developers,  a development  culture  centered  on SI projects,  etc. [Source]  “Quality  improvement
is essential  in the software-centered  era.” - https://blog  naver.com/rsupport/221358144195
In the past, software  development  projects  could be conducted  normally  without  systematic
implementation  simply by relying on the experience  of programmers.  However,  today’s  large projects
involving  hundreds  of developers  face many challenges,  such as communication,  schedule  and cost
management  issues that arise from the lengthy development  period and changes  to ambiguous
and complex  requirements,  etc. Therefore,  it is essential  to understand  how to develop  and manage
software  systematically  and to improve  enterprises’  competencies,  in order to develop  software  of
the highest  quality and promote  productivity.
