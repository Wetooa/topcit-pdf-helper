D) Hierarchy
A hierarchy  can be defined as a system composed  of several layers that provide  its own specific service. It has
the advantage  of making  problem  solving  easier when applied.  If a problem  occurs, it can be checked  in an easy
layer. Also, it is compatible  with other equipment  because  the equipment  is standardized.  The seven layers of
the OSI (Open System Interconnection)  model, a network  protocol  developed  by the International  Standards
Organization  (ISO), is a representative  example  of the hierarchical  structure.
03 Method  of Expressing  Software  Architecture  Design
A) Context  model
The boundary  between  the initial requirements  analysis  system and the external  environment  should be set.
The context  diagram represents  a system as a large process before dividing  the system. This model shows
system IO data by describing the system area that should be developed,  determining  the boundary  between
the system and the external  environment,  and presenting  the interface  with the outside.
This model focuses  on the interface  between  the system and the external  environment.  When beginning  an
analysis,  analysts  should focus on understanding  the data exchanged  between  the user and the system, as
well as the type of mutual exchange,  first. When the boundary  of the system is set, the inside of the system is
analyzed  to realize it. It is the same as giving priority  to goals in developing  a system.
B) Component  diagram
A component  is a part that can be reused, so that a well-made  part can be purchased  from other fields
and plugged in, to speed up software  development  and increase  productivity.  In essence, reusability  is the
foundation  of this technology.  Reuse technology  is designed  to speed up software  development  and increase
productivity  by reusing  proven parts as much as possible.
Components  should communicate  and cooperate  with other systems  or external  devices. The standard for
component  implementation  and documentation  should be established  to guarantee  the interoperability  of the
components.  Here, “components  association”  is a process  of assembling  components.  There are several types
of association  including  sequential  association,  hierarchical  association,  and additional  association.
C) Package  diagram
Commercial  software  developed  for a large number  of users is called a “package”,  and subsystems  are often
released  as packages.  Once defined as a package,  the relationship  of dependence  between  packages  can be
minimized  by hiding the inner details of the package  from the outside.  The package  composed  of a subsystem
is a set of functionally  related classes.
The package  diagram represents  the relationship  of dependence  between  subsystems.  It is suitable  for
representing  software  architecture  because  it represents  a subsystem  that is abstracted  at a higher level. If
subsystems  are divided to minimize  the association  relationship  between  subsystems,  dependence  between
objects  can be minimized  and complexity  can be reduced.
