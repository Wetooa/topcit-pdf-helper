+ Block cipher algorithm
The block cipher algorithm  performs  the encryption  and decryption  process, using the cryptographic
algorithm  that transforms  fixed size input blocks into fixed size output blocks using a secret key. The block
cipher algorithm  includes  Feistel Network,  DES (Data Encryption  Standard),  AES (Advanced  Encryption
Standard),  IDEA (International  (Data Encryption  Algorithm),  SEED, and ARIA. <Table 3> shows major attack
techniques  against  the block cipher system.
<Table 3> Block cipher  attack  techniques
Attack  technique Contents
Differential  attackThe differential  attack  is a method  of attack  on the selected  plaintext.  This attack  technique  finds the
key used for encryption  by using the bit difference  of the ciphertext  blocks, which corresponds  to the
difference  of two plaintext  blocks.
Linear  attackThe linear attack is a method  of attacking  plaintext.  This attack  technique  finds the encryption  key by
properly  linearizing  a nonlinear  structure  inside a cryptographic  algorithm.
Brute force attackAn attack technique  that finds the encryption  key by comparing  plaintext  and ciphertext  by using all
possible  encryption  keys used for encryption.
Statistical  analysisAn attack technique  that decrypts  ciphertext  using all known statistical  data, including  statistical  data
on the frequency  of each word used in ciphertext.
Mathematical
analysisAn attack technique  that decrypts  ciphertext  using mathematical  theories,  including  statistical
methods.
+ Stream cipher algorithm
A stream cipher is a method developed  mainly in Europe. Unlike block ciphers that perform encryption  and
decryption  in blocks, ciphertext  is created by the bitwise XOR operation  of the plaintext  bit string, and
the bit string of the key, as shown in [Figure 7]. RC4 is a representative  stream cipher, and there are other
algorithms,  such as A5/1 and A5/2.
