Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Immediate  addressing  mode
+ Displacement  addressing  mode: Relative  addressing  mode, indexed  addressing  mode, and base-register  addressing
mode
E) Locality
The locality is a tendency  in which programs  intensively  refer to a specific  area in the moment,  rather than uniformly
accessing  information  in the memory  device.
+ Temporal  locality:  Recently  accessed  programs  or data are more likely to be accessed  again in the near future.
+ Spatial locality:  Data stored adjacent  to the storage  device is more likely to be accessed  continuously,
+ Sequential  locality: Instructions  are fetched  and executed  in the order in which they were stored, unless branched
(about  20%).
04 1/0 Device
A) Concept  of I/O device
The device is necessary  to perform an input operation  that stores data to be processed  by the CPU in the memory
unit, as well as an output  operation  that transfers  the processing  results  from the main memory  to an output  medium.
B) I/O controller  structure  and addressing  methods
An /O controller  is necessary  to process  inputs and outputs,  as shown in [Figure 36], and it plays the following  roles:
+ I/O device control  and timing  coordination
* Communication  with the CPU
* Communication  with the I/O device
+ Data buffering
+ Error detection
