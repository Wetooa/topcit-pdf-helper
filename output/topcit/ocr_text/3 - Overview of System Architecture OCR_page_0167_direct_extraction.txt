It is a procedure  used by the control unit of a communication  network  to determine  whether  to accept a connection
request.
© Service  quality model and protocol
Service quality models include  the integrated  service (IntServ)  model and the differentiated  service (DiffServ)  model.
The service  quality  protocol  is the resource  reservation  protocol  (RSVP).
Table 48) Service  Quality Model and Protocol  [6]
Service  quality  model Description
Integrated  service - Flow-based  quality model that explicitly  reserves  resources,  such as bandwidth  for the given data
(IntServ) flow
Resource  reservation - A protocol  standardized  to reserve  and secure the bandwidth  needed  by the application  programs
Protocol  (RSVP) between  terminals  (RFC 2110)
Differentiated  service - Class-based  service quality  model that specifies  the required  service type each time a packet is
(DiffServ) transmitted,  and operates  according  to packet priority
05 Routing  Protocol  Algorithm  and Type
A) What is a routing  protocol?
Routing  protocol  defines  the types of messages  exchanged  between  routers,  exchange  procedure,  and actions  when
receiving  a message,  for efficient  setting  and updating  of the routing  tables.
B) What is a routing  algorithm?
The routing algorithm  finds the low-cost  path between  a source router and a destination  router in a graphical
network,  connected  by links with a cost between  routers. The low-cost  path refers to the path of minimum  value
among  the sum of link costs out of all possible  paths from the source to the destination.  <Table 49> shows the types
of routing  algorithms.
Table 49) Routing  Algorithm  Types
Algorithm Description
+ Link state routing  algorithm
+ Each router calculates  the low-cost  path to all destinations  with the configuration  and link-state  information
of the entire network.Link state
Routing
+ Distance  vector routing  algorithm
Distance  vector + Each router maintains  the low-cost  path table (vector)  to all destination  routers.
Routing + The initial router path cost table only maintains  the cost data of the directly  connected  routers, and the
router notifies  the path cost data to the neighboring  routers.
