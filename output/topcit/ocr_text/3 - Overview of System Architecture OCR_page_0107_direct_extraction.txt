Liveness Embedded  software  should never stop its operation,  even after unexpected  events.
Resource  and Embedded  software  should meet the resource  (CPU processing  speed, memory  size, and user
environmental  constraints  | interface)  and environmental  (power  supply  and protocol  compatibility)  constraints.
04 Embedded  OS
A) Concept  of embedded  OS
An embedded  OS is an operating  system that is optimized  to execute  the application  programs  running  on a
computer  system that perform specific functions  for controlling a  machine  or other systems.  It is optimized  for a
specific  system  that has hardware  with a built-in  microprocessor,  and it performs  set purposes.  In the early embedded
systems,  the hardware  was directly  controlled  using the assembly  language,  and it operated  without  a separate  OS.
However,  as the embedded  system applications  have diversified, the need to use an OS has increased,
B) Embedded  OS structure  and applied  technology
As shown in [Figure 73], an embedded  OS generally  has a structure  to support the stable application  program
execution  with a low-specification  processor,  a limited memory  and storage  device, and poor operating  environment
conditions.
