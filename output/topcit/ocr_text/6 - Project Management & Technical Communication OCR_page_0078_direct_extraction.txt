The initiating,  planning,  executing,  and closing process  usually proceeds  at each relevant  stage, whereas  the
monitoring  and controlling  process  is evenly conducted  throughout  the life cycle.
<Table 34> Project  Management  Process  Groups
Process  Group Explanation
Formal project  initiation,  stakeholder  identification,  project  manager  appointment,
Dene proces project charter development
Planning  process All planning  activities  to achieve  project  goals and create outputs
Executing  process A process  to complete  the tasks defined  in the project  management  plan.
Monitoring  and controlling
process A process of tracking  project performance  and progress,  and making adjustments
Closing  process A process  to complete  all activities  including  contractual  obligations
The life cycle is the period from when a service or product  is released  until it is no longer used or retired from
the market. The life cycle of a project refers to the period from initiating,  planning,  executing,  monitoring  and
controlling,  and closing  of the project.
Project  life cycle management  is to approach  project management  in the systems  engineering  model. It is to
facilitate  the management  of the entire project by dividing  the life cycle into detailed stages, and system-
atically managing  inputs, technologies,  tools, and outputs  for each stage. The life cycle simply describes  the
whole process  by each step to prepare  the basis for the systems  engineering  approach,  and the methodology
is a concrete  specification  of inputs, technologies,  tools and outputs  for each step.
The predictive  life cycle is a planning-focused  life cycle, and it is determined  at the beginning  of the project
as knowledge  about the project scope, schedule,  and cost is accumulated  empirically.  It is mainly applied to
