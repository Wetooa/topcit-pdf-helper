of various properties  and operations  that represent  the properties  of the object concerned.  The documents
created in the preceding  phase can be used to find a class, its properties,  and the relationships  between
classes.  Problem  description  documents  or use case scenarios  can be used to identify  a class.
B) Dynamic  modeling
The classes constituting  a system  can be found and the properties  and relationships  of the classes can be
identified  using the static modeling  described  above. Now let’s learn how to perform  dynamic  modeling  based
on the results of static analysis.  While static modeling  literally focuses  on the static structure  of a system,
dynamic  modeling  is a process  of finding  the operations  of classes  by paying  attention  to changes  in the state
or behavior  of the objects  that constitute  a system,  or the interactions  between  objects.
Dynamic  modeling  identifies  class operations  based on interactions  between  objects.  Class operations  are
defined to perform the functions  requested  by the messages  of other objects. In general,  a UML sequence
diagram  is used to represent  the interactions  between  objects.  The sequence  diagram  emphasizes  the transfer
process of the messages  exchanged  between  objects over time, while the collaboration  diagram  expresses
the cooperative  relations  and exchanges  of message  between  objects.  These two diagrams  are also called an
interaction  diagram.
The activity  diagram is used to accurately  understand  the process  of handling  events in a class. It is used to
understand  the procedure  for handling  complex  processes  or to identify  the additional  operations  of a class.
This activity  diagram  can help to understand  the activities  occurring  in each use case and the dependencies
between  them. In addition,  if the operation  of a specific  object is composed  of a complex  structure  internally,  it
can be represented  using an activity  diagram.
The table below divides  the UML diagram  into the functional  model, static model, and dynamic  model.
