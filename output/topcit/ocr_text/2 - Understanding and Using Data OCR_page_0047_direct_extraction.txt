03 Impact  of Database  Design in the Project  Lifecycle
Data modeling  can be clearly defined in the project lifecycle because  it is separated  into the analysis phase and the
design phase. Usually, business-oriented  logical data modeling  is performed in the analysis  phase, and physical  data
modeling  is performed  by considering  hardware  and performance  in the methodology,  based on information  engineering
or structural  models, In the spiral model, the logical data model and the physical  data model are performed  on both sides
according  to the size of the task in the analysis  and design phase. The logical data model is performed  more frequently
in the analysis  phase.

As a project is implemented  by separating  it into the data axis and the application  axis, matters  identified  by both sides
are mutually  verified  in order to increase  the completeness  by phase. However,  the object-oriented  concept  is performed
in an integrated  way without  separating  data modeling  and processing  modeling,  because  modeling  is performed  by
