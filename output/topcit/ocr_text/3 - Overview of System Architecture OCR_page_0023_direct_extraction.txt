01 Concept  of System  Architecture
A) Understanding  system  architecture
@ Overview  of system  architecture
An information  system is a system that uses information  technology  (IT). The information  system provides  services
using a computer,  and a computer  operates  with a combination  of hardware  and software.  Implementing  an
information  system used inside an enterprise,  or provided  as a service  to users, requires  the design and construction
of IT infrastructures,  such as hardware  and software  design and development.  Software  designs the software
components  and operations,  such as the connection  of the software  components  and constraints  based on software
architecture.  Hardware,  like software,  designs  and develops  the hardware  architecture.  System architecture  refers
to the architecture  for a system to provide services,  based on hardware  and software  architecture.  In a broader
definition,  it refers to all architecture,  including  the application  architecture  (AA), data architecture  (DA), and technical
architecture  (TA), for constructing  an information  system.  A narrow definition  refers to the document  that defines  the
configuration  and relationship  of hardware,  such as a server, storage,  network  and security,  and certain  software  parts,
such as OS and middleware.
@ Definition  of system  architecture
* Definition  as defined  by the International  Council  on Systems  Engineering  (INCOSE)
The fundamental  and unifying  system structure  defined in terms of system elements,  interfaces,  processes,
constraints,  and behaviors.
