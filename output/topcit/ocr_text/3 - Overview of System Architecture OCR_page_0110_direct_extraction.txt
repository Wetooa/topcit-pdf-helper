Overview  of System  Architecture
>p> Recent  trends  and issues
With the advent  of the information  age, the social demand  to construct  information  system infrastructure
is increasing,  and various information  systems  are being implemented  for business  efficiency  and customer
service improvement.  These information  systems  generally  consist  of hardware,  software,  and human
resources.  It is necessary  to understand  the concept,  architecture,  and structure  of the information  to
implement  a successful  information  system.
Recent information  systems  tend to adopt a large number  of web-based  structures.  In that regard,
theinformation  system projects  of the planners  (public institutions)  and implementers  (systems  integrators
and hardware  manufacturers)  need to procure hardware  resources  that suit the project scope in order to
improve  the efficiency  of investment  in information  systems.
Information  system infrastructure  is generally  implemented  by purchasing  servers, storage,  and network
devices  separately  from each vendor, then integrating  them for the project. Moreover,  they also purchase
software  separately,  and thus need to test and verify if it works properly  with the hardware.
The complex  structures  and procedures  of constructing  information  system infrastructure  have inevitably
resulted in inefficiency  in construction  time and system management.  The converged  infrastructure
that integrates  the hardware,such  as storage,  servers, and networks,  with the virtualization  solution  and
the management  software  into a product,  and validates  it in advance  for supply to customers, has been
introduced  to compensate  for it. Moreover,  the hyper-converged  infrastructure  that complements  the high
investment  cost has also appeared.  These efforts to increase  the efficiency  of system  implementation  are
ongoing,
