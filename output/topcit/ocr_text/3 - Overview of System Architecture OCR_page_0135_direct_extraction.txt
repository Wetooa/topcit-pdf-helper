© Full virtualization
Full virtualization  completely  virtualizes  the hardware.  Although  the guest OS perceives  that it owns and accesses
the hardware  directly,  the virtual server  uses the resources  that the hypervisor  emulates  to look like hardware.  If the
guest OS intends  to monopolize  the hardware,  the hypervisor  must handle  these commands  separately.  A CPU (Intel's
VT or AMD-V)  that supports  virtualization  is necessary  to emulate  hardware  resources,  other than the CPU, fully.
The performance  has greatly increased  since the hypervisor, included  in the CPU, handles  it at high speed. There is
no need to modify  the guest OS, since the CPU handles  full virtualization.  Therefore,  there are no restrictions  on the
guest OS. Linux-based  guest OS and Windows  guest OS can operate  simultaneously.  The native hypervisor  generally
corresponds  to full virtualization.

@ Para-virtualization
Para-virtualization  does not completely  virtualize  the hardware,  and the guest OS must operate  through  the
hypervisor  in order to access the hardware  resources.  It is a method  of using the hypervisor  API, without  hardware
emulation,  It is necessary  to partially  modify  the guest OS's kernel to use the hypervisor  API.
It has the advantage  of providing  a high performance,  since it can control it through  a hypervisor,  without  hardware
emulation.[t  has the disadvantage  that it can use only an open-source  OS as a guest OS, since the kernel of the
guest OS needs to be partially  modified.
