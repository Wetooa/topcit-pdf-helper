and u, and all (|V|—1) nodes of the graph, excluding  u, can be the shortest  distance  between  s and u. Therefore,  the
Bellman-Ford  Algorithm  performs  the edge-relaxation  |V|—1 times for all edges.
(Figure 121] shows Bellman-Ford  Algorithm’s  pseudo-code.

C) Routing  protocol  types
The routing  protocol  is classified  into static routing  and dynamic  routing,  depending  on the routing  type, as shown in
(Figure 122]. The dynamic  routing  method is divided into the EGP (Exterior  Gateway  Protocol)  method  and the IGP
(Interior  Gateway  Protocol)  method, according  to the classification  of AS (Autonomous  System).  The IGP (Interior
Gateway  Protocol)  method  is further  divided into the distance  vector method,  the link-state  method,  and the hybrid
method,  according  to the routing  setting  method.

[Figure 122] Routing  Protocol  Classification
The type of routing  protocol  can be divided into an internal  router protocol  and an external  router protocol,  based on
the autonomous  system (AS). Here, AS refers to networks  with an independent  management  system and the same
operating  policy.
