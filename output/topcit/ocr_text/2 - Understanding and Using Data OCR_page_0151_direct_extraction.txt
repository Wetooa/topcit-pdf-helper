03 NoSQL
A) Definition  and characteristics  of NoSQL
A NoSQL database  provides  other means of processing  than the tabular  relations  used in relational  databases.  NoSQL
is anon-relational  distributed  data repository  that can be expanded  horizontally,  such as data replication  and distributed
storage  on multiple  servers  focusing  on the write speed for processing  unstructured  and ultra-high-capacity  data.
<Table  75> Characteristics  of NoSQL
Characteristic Description
fee  of  lager - Provides a loose data structure that allows data to be processed  at the petabyte level.
Use of flexible - Saves data relatively  freely without  a predefined  schema.
schemas - Saves (data) in a simplified  form such as the key value, graph, and document  structure.
Inexpensive  cluster - Supports  scale-out,  data replication,  and distributed  storage  using multiple  servers  composed  of
configuration Pc-level commercial  hardware.
Simple  CLI (Call Level | - No query language  like SQL in existing  relational  databases  is provided.
Interface) - Asimple  interface  is provided  by calling a simple API or HTTP.
High availability - NoSQL loads data by automatically  dividing  data items into the cluster  environment.
Allows as much - While the relational  DBMS focuses  on ensuring  logical structure  and ACID, NoSQL makes  the
integrity  as needed application  process  some of the integrity  works instead of assigning  them all to the DBMS.
The methods  of saving  data are largely divided into column,  value, document,  and chart, using a
Schema-less function  that allows data storage  and access using the key values, without  the fixed data schema for
data modeling.
NoSQL  has a structure  that allows expansion  of the system's  scale and performance  and distribution
Elasticity of the I/O load more easily,  so that large-scale  data can be created, updated,  and queried,  while not
causing  downtime  for any clients and application  systems  that access  the system,  even if the system
fails partially.
NoSQL  provides  query language,  related processing  technology,  and API that can efficiently  search
Query and process  data according  to the characteristics  of data even in a system composed  of tens or
thousands  of servers.
NoSQL  has a structure  in which memory-based  caching  technology  is very important,  and which can
Caching provide a high-performance  response  speed even for large-scale  queries and be consistently  applied
to development  and operation.
High scalability Partitioning  allows a gradual  node increase.
: Sees There is no single point of failure, and data are available  even though  a certain node is down because
High availability .they are replicated.
5 The result should be quickly  returned  based on memory  instead  of disk, which can be achieved  byHigh performanceusing the non-blocking  write and low complexity  algorithm.
Atomicity Each write operation  needs to be atomic.
Consistency Strong consistency  is not needed, but the resulting  consistency  is sufficient  (Read-Your-Writes).
Persistence Data should be kept on a disk, not just in a volatile memory  only.
Deploment When a node is added or deleted,  data should be automatically  loaded  without  the need for data
flexibility distribution  or manual mediation,  and there should be no constraints,  such as distributed  file system  or
shared storage,  or any need for special hardware.  Hardware  should be operable  in heterogeneous  hardware.
Modeling  flexibilityData of various  types such as key-value  pairs, hierarchical  data, and graphs  should be modeled
conveniently.
Query  flexibility
150 TOPCIT  ESSENCEMultiple  GET that obtains  a set of values  for the provided  key from a query, and queries  that obtain
data based on a specific  range of keys, are needed.
