@ Functional  cohesion
+ When all functional  elements  inside a module  are performed  in connection  with a single problem.
@ Sequential  cohesion
+ When the output  data from one activity in a module  are used as the input data of the next activity.
@® Communication  cohesion
+ When components  performing  different  functions  while using the same input and output  are gathered.
@ Procedural  cohesion
+ When a module has multiple related functions,  and the components  of the module perform  those functions
sequentially.
© Temporal  cohesion
+ When creating  a module  by combing  several  functions  that are processed  at a specific  time.
© Logical  cohesion
+ When a module is created using processing  elements  that have similar characteristics  or are classified  in a
specific  form.
@ Coincidental  cohesion
+ When each component  inside a module is composed  of unrelated  elements  only.
B) Coupling
Modules  have an associative  relationship  with other modules.  “Coupling”  refers to the complexity  of correlations
between  modules.  Coupling  between  the modules  increases  when modules  interact  more and depend  on each
other more. In particular,  when the interface  is not set correctly  or the functions  are not correctly  divided,  an
unnecessary  interface  appears  and increases  the degree of dependence  between  modules  and coupling.
Coupling  is a method of indicating  a correlation  between  program  elements  and is closely related to module
independence  and cohesion.  If two modules  function  perfectly,  whether  they are adjacent  to each other or
not, they are completely  independent  of each other and do not interact  at all. Data coupling  in which modules
communicate  with parameters  is the most ideal - and weakest  - coupling.  Content  coupling  in which a module
directly refers to or modifies  another  module’s  internal function  or data is the strongest  coupling,  and should
be avoided.
If coupling  is strong, it is difficult to change a module independently,  and changes  in one module affect other
modules  significantly,  causing  a ripple effect. The greater  the ripple effect, the more difficult it is to maintain
the system.  The ripple effect is a phenomenon  in which, when one thing is affected,  it goes on to affect many
other things. If this effect occurs in system  development,  it lands many people in trouble.
Therefore,  coupling  needs to be reduced  as much as possible  when designing  software. When modules  share
variables  or exchange  control information,  coupling  between  modules  increases.  Because  of this (to weaken
coupling),  we are instructed  not to use global variables,  if possible,  and to use parameters  when learning
