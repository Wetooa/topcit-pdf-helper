ESSENCE
problem  awareness  of asking “why” to enhance  problem-solving  skills.
@ Develop  an active attitude  to solve problems.
Since there are many variables  in every problem,  a solution may not come out from a momentary  thought.
Therefore,  positive thinking  about problem-solving  and the ability to transform  ideas are important.  This
is because  there are many cases where things that are completely  irrelevant  are linked together  and new
alternatives  are proposed.
© Take ownership  of your problems.
Ownership  that sees a problem as yours and accountability  that strives to resolve it are the most important.
When problem-solving  is difficult,  we often pass the buck, saying  “because  of what” or “because  of whom’, etc.
But in this way, you cannot solve problems  or become  a professional  employee.
