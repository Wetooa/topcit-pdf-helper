+ Preview  for practical  business  Managing  information  safely
Assistant  manager  Kim, working  for web application  program  development  company  A, has been in
charge of developing, deploying,  and maintaining  Java-based  source  programs.  He should check the
web pages and servers on a regular basis when processing  his work. However,  he is not safe from
various security  threats  that are becoming  diversified  and intelligent  by regular  check only.
He also should exchange  source programs  with partners  while doing his work and should ensure that
those source programs  are not disclosed  to other competitors.
In such a situation,  confidentiality  must be ensured so that a large number  of source programs,
managed  by Kim, are not disclosed  to unauthorized  third parties during storage or transmission.
To do this, let’s see what steps Kim should take, and how to apply the concept  of confidentiality  in
practice.
