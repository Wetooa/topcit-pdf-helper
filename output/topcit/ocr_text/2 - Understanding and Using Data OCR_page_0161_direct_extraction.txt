@ Background  and definition  of deep leaming
+ Al technology  that allows computers  to learn on their own, like humans,  by combining  existing  supervised  learning,
which requires  human intervention,  with more active unsupervised  learning.
+ A series of machine  learning  based on the deep neural networks  (DNN) theory and an algorithm that teaches
computers  how to think like a human.
