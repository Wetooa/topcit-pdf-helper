B) Page replacement  technique  of the virtual memory  unit
If all pages are filled in the paging  virtual memory  unit, free space must be created  before loading  new memory  pages
from the auxiliary  memory  unit. The system selects  a page to replace the page replacement  technique,  affecting  the
system  efficiency  and performance.
+ Optimal  technique:  This technique  replaces  a page that is not likely to be used for the longest  time. Although  it
is the optimal replacement  technique  with the minimum  absent page rate, it is not a realistic  technique,  since it is
difficult  to predict  behavior.
+ First In First Out (FIFO) technique:  This technique  tracks the order of loading  in the main memory  and replaces  the
first loaded page.
+ Least Recently  Used (LRU) technique:  This technique  replaces  the page that has been unused  for the longest  time.
+ Least Frequently  Used (LFU) technique:  This technique  tracks each page's utilization  frequency  and replaces  the
least used or least intensively  used page.
+ Not Used Recently  (NUR) technique:  This technique  uses the tendency  that the page not used recently  is less likely
to be used in the near future, so it replaces  the page.
