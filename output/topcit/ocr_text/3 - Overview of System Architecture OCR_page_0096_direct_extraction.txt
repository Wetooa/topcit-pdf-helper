@ Lossless  compression
Since the compression  and decompression  algorithms  are exactly  the opposite  of each other, the compression
method preserves  the original data’s integrity,  and no part of the data is lost during processing.  Leading  lossless
compression  methods  include run-length  decoding,  dictionary  decoding,  Huffman  coding, dictionary  coding, and
arithmetic  coding.
(Table 15) Lossless  Compression
Compression  method Description
Runrlenath Sli + Run-length  encoding  (RLE)
al “RL ine + Amethod  expressing  consecutively  repeated symbols in terms of the symbol and repetition  count
(run-length)
+ Dictionary  coding
+ Amethod  that creates  a dictionary  while scanning  a message,  and if an entry character  string in the
Pistenenyeceiing dictionary  is found in the message,  the code value (index value) of the entry is sent instead of the
string
+ Huffman  coding
Huffman  coding + Amethod  that encodes  data in a binary pattern  and allocates  short codes to symbols  that occur more
frequently  and long codes to symbols  that occur less frequently
+ Arithmetic  coding
Arithmetic  coding + Amethod  that maps the entire message  to a small section in [0,1] and encodes  the small section ina
binary pattern
@ Lossy compression
The lossy compression  method  compromises  some accuracy  to increase  the compression  rate, by allowing  the loss of
redundant  or unnecessary  data. There are two types of lossy compression  methods:  prediction  coding  and transform
coding. The prediction  coding method is used for digitizing  the analog signal. Instead of separately  quantizing  the
PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)  samples,  it quantizes  the difference.  The difference values are smaller  than the actual
sample  values, so fewer bits are required.  The transform  coding  method  transforms  a signal from one domain  (mainly
a time and space domain)  to another  domain  (mainly  a frequency  domain),  then compresses  it.
B) Multimedia  data
Multimedia  data includes  text, image, video, and audio data. The text has the form of plain text and non-linear
hypertext.  The basic language  is Unicode  for expressing  symbols,  and it uses a lossless  compression  method.
In multimedia,  an image is called a still image and refers to a photo, fax page, or a video frame. As shown in [Figure
70], an image is transmitted  as binary data through a transformation  process,  a quantization  process,  and an
encoding  process,  before being converted  back into an image through  the reverse  process.
In the transformation  process,  the JPEG uses DCT (Discrete  Cosine Transform)  in the first stage of compression,  and
the decompression  uses the inverse DCT method.  The transformation  and inverse  transformation  apply 8 X 8 blocks.
The quantization  process  creates integers  from the real number  of the DCT transform  output and converts  some
values to zero. The coding process  arranges  data in a zigzag order after quantization  and before encoder  input, then
lossless  compression  is performed  using run-length  decoding  and arithmetic  coding [1].
