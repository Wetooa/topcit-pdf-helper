poorly  designed  UX.
In the medical  device field, where software  directly  impacts  human life, people are more sensitive  than
in any other field since minor defects in a medical  device can have devastating  consequences  for a
patient,  even including  death. So which of the following  could have more catastrophic  consequences,
a faulty in a physical  device or a user’s mistake  during an operation?  Most people answer  the former:
however,  user mistakes  resulting  from complex  operational methods  and such like can pose a greater
risk. For example,  if the pad attachment  position  of a cardiac  defibrillator  is not intuitively  described,
emergency  measures  will not have any effect, and the result is likely to be the opposite.  The following
examples  show how important  UX is.
Therac 25, a radiation  therapy  device developed  in the early ’70s,
was upgraded  to address the inconvenience  caused by the
separation  of physical device setting  and prescription  processing  by
the administrator  console. In July 1985, an accident  occurred  during
radiation  therapy  at the Ontario (Canada)  Cancer  Foundation,  where
a patient died from excessive  exposure  to radiation  in November  of
the same year. A report on the analysis  of medical  accidents  revealedvy
that the accident  was caused by a wrongly  designed  error message
during the upgrade.  In the end, the accident  was attributed to the
fact that the radiation  therapist  was insensitive  to the unknown  error—message  of Therac  25. (Similar  error messages  were distinguished  by
the number  at the end of each message,  which cannot be clearly identified.)  Because  of this, the
device was abnormally  interrupted  five times, exposing  the patient  to excessive  radiation  during
treatment.
Recently,  many companies  have striver to maximize  the use of the customers  using the information
on the limited size screen to secure more customers  and increase  sales in the field of mobile business
using smartphones.  Moreover,  a growing  number  of companies  are contemplating  using UI/UX to
provide  customer-oriented  valuable  services  and forming  expert  organizations.
