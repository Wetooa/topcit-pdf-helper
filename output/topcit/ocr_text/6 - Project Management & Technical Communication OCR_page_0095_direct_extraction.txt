@ Estimation  of Activity  Duration
Activity  duration  estimation  is a process  of estimating  the time it will take to perform each activity  with the
allocated  resources.  The estimation  method is as follows:

Estimation  Method Characteristics  and Explanation
+ Amethod  that a resource  estimation  expert  uses internal or external  resources  with similarExpert  Judgmentexperience  to calculate  the resources  to be put into the activity.
Analogous  Estimating + Amethod  of estimation  by referring  to similar  projects  performed  in the past
+ Risk-based  estimation  technique
Three-point  Estimating + Estimate  the beta average  of Optimistic  value, Most Likely value, Pessimistic  value
+ Commonly  used in case of lack of experience
Expert Judgment  and Analogous Estimating  are common  methods  used by practitioners  and those with
extensive  experience  in the field. Three-point  Estimating  is a method  of measuring  the optimistic,  pessimistic,
and most likely values for each activity  in consideration  of risks, which allows more accurate  estimation.  The
term “Three-point”  has the following  meanings:
+ Optimistic,  O: the best-case  estimate,  the shortest  duration
+ Most likely, M: the most likely estimate,  the average  duration
+ Pessimistic,  P: the worst-case  estimate,  the longest  duration
In the three-point  estimation  method,  the most likely estimate  receives  a multiplier of 4 to come up with the
final estimate  of an activity. If an activity  takes 4 days to be optimistic,  10 days to be pessimistic,  and 6 days
to be the most likely, the duration  of the activity using the three-point  estimation  method is calculated  as
(4+4*6+10)/6  = 6.3 days.

The three-point calculation  formula is derived from the existing  PERT (Program  Evaluation  and Review
Technique)  technique.  PERT is a technique  developed  by Booz Allen Hamilton  in 1958 for the U.S. Navy Special
Projects  Office to track  and manage  the progress  of the Polaris nuclear  submarine  project. It is widely used
in new projects  and is an analytic  technique  that supports  predicting  the project schedule  in consideration  of
various  risk factors  and fluctuations.

Schedule  development  is a process  of creating  a project schedule  by analyzing  the sequence  of activities,  the
estimated  duration,  resource  requirements,  and schedule  constraints.
