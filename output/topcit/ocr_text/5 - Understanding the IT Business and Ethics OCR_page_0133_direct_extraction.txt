@ Servitization
The term “servitization”  refers to a fundamental  transformation  of the business  model in which a product  evolves
into a service bundle that continues  to deliver value throughout  the lifecycle  of a customer  experience.  This means
that the system of competition  has shifted to around service  whose revenue  generation potential is intimately  tied
to the availability,  reliability  and performance  of the company’s  assets. In particular,  this phenomenon  is expected  to
accelerate  in the traditional  manufacturing  sector  where revenues  are generated  from the sales of goods.
As the traditional  product  sales model gives way to a service model and as companies  find it increasingly  difficult  to
differentiate  themselves  on the merits of their products  alone, many are striving  to differentiate  themselves  through
servitization,  ie. by combining  their products  with software.  The software  model for the servitization  of a product  can
be one of three types, as shown below,
<Table  65>SW  convergent  model of products
Type of model Description
Product-centered  model | A model which features  strengthened  service  elements  without  sacrificing  the sales-oriented  model.
A model in which the producer  retains  the ownership  but sells the right to use the product  to anUsage-based  model outside  party,
Additional  sales-oriented  | A model in which the producer  sells diverse  value-added  services  based on a product  that has
model already been sold.
Many companies  are strengthening  their software  convergence  capabilities  so as to be able to respond  flexibly  to
the changing  environment  and secure a competitive  edge in the market  through  servitization.  Software  convergence
capabilities  are becoming  a key factor in determining  the value of products  and corporate  performance.
Many companies  are converging  their products  and software  to optimize  their business  models and respond to the
rapidly changing  consumer  environment.
