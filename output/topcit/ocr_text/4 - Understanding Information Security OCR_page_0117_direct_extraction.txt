system must process  all those small packets.  As a result, it takes a lot more load than the normal Ping
command,  and the performance  of the system is degraded.
This attack can be responded  to by blocking  ICMP protocols,  which sends the Ping command,  using  a firewall
and other devices.
+ Syn flooding  attack
Syn flooding  attacks exploit the vulnerability  that half-open  connection  can establish  during the 3-way
handshaking  process (TCP connection  setup process).  The system, under this attack, can no longer accept
connection  requests  from outside.  Therefore,  normal services  cannot be provided.  Not only Windows  systems,
but all systems  that provide  TCP-based  services on the Internet  (for example,  web server, FTP server, mail
server, etc.), can be damaged  by this attack.
This attack can be responded  to by reducing  the waiting time of the SYN reception  status in the target
system,  or by installing  an intrusion  prevention  system.
+ Boink attack
The Boink attack is a DoS attack  that modifies  Boink. Assuming  that the packet  size is 100 bytes, 1 is sent as.
the sequence  number  (which is the byte number)  of the first packet.  After that, 101 is sent as the sequence
number  of the next packet, and 201 is normally  sent as the next packet. Then, 2002 is abnormally  sent as
the 20th packet, and 101 is normally  sent as the 21st packet. Then, 2002 is abnormally sent as the 22nd
packet, and so on. As a result, the overload  of repeatedly  sending  and combining  packets is applied to the
attack  target system.
The countermeasures  against  this attack are similar to those against  the ping of dead attack or Syn flooding
attack.
The DDoS (Distributed  DOS) attack is the evolved type of the DoS attack. The DDoS attack is a DoS attack
that has multiple  attack sources.
@ Sniffing  attack
Sniffing is based on the concept  of eavesdropping,  etc., and is also known as a passive attack. All systems
connected  to the Internet,  that is, LAN, have an IP address (layer 3 address)  and a MAC (medium  access
control) address (layer 2 address)  implemented  in a network  interface  card. Since every MAC address  on the
Internet  has a different  value, each system can be uniquely  identified.
All hosts on the same LAN share the same communication  line. Therefore,  computers  on the LAN can view all
the communication  traffic of other computers.
Due to this characteristic,  network interface  cards (commonly  referred to as LAN cards) have  a filtering
function  that ignores  a frame without  its own MAC address.  This filtering  function  ensures  that only traffic with
its own MAC address  can be received.
However,  users can set the function that enables  all traffic to be viewed, using the LAN card in case of special
circumstances,  which is called promiscuous  mode. Sniffing is an attack that eavesdrops  on all traffic on a
specific  LAN, by setting  the LAN card to promiscuous  mode.
When a LAN uses a switch, traffic is sent to a specific destination  computer.  Therefore,  even if the LAN card
is set to promiscuous  mode, traffic of other destinations  cannot be received.  In this case, sniffing can be
performed  using the method  of switch  jamming,  ARP redirect,  ICMP redirect,  MAC spoofing,  etc.
