Problems  with practical  business  that occur when data quality  deteriorates
Deterioration  in data quality  brings about confusion  and distrust,  as follows.
+ The result value becomes  different  depending  on the requesting  department  (supervisory  authority,  etc.).
+ The information  provided  by IT cannot  be fully trusted.
+ It takes time and money  to improve  or adjust inaccurate  data.
+ Data reliability  cannot  be guaranteed  even with an additional  budget.
+ Decisions  cannot  be made quickly  due to inaccurate  data.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the exact number  for a specific  situation.

+ Customer  satisfaction  increases,  service  quality  improves,  and product  competitiveness  increases.

What if database  quality  control  and standardization  are not understood?
The importance  of quality control and standardization,  which constitute  the basis of information  systems,
is being increasingly  emphasized  as information  systems  become  larger and more complex.  If database
quality control is not clearly understood,  the information  provided by IT cannot be fully trusted because
the result value will differ depending  on the requesting  department.  In addition,  decisions  cannot be made
quickly  because  it takes a lot of time and money  to improve  and adjust inaccurate  data. On the other hand,
an inappropriate  understanding  of data standardization  can cause data duplication  and data inconsistency
for each organization,  work, and system. In addition,  information  cannot be provided  in time as it takes
more time to understand  the meaning  of data. Also, data integration,  information  system change, and
maintenance  become  very difficult  if data are not properly  standardized.  Therefore,  it is very important  to
understand  the concept  and process  of database  quality  control  and standardization.
