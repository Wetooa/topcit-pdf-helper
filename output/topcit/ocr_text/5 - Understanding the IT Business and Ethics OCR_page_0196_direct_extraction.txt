The EU's GDPR reinforces  the rights of data subjects  compared  to existing  data protection  guidelines  by newly
guaranteeing  the right to be forgotten  and the right to transfer  data, and strictly restricts  the transfer  of data of EU
citizens  abroad.
The main items to guarantee  the rights of data subjects  in GDPR are as follows.
+ the right to be informed
+ the right of access
+ the right to rectification
+ the right to erasure
+ the right to restrict  processing
+ the right to data portability
+ the right to object
+ rights in relation to automated  decision  making  and profiling
The right to erasure (right to request  erasure)  has been renamed  from the right to forgotten  in the previous  GDPR
draft, and the right to erasure  and the right to data portability  are items that reinforce  the rights of data subjects.
The rights in relation  to automated  decision  making  and profiling  refer to the right to notify the user who is the data
subject  and to let them decide whether  their information  will be used or not, when an individual's  occupation,  hobbies,
and location  are automatically  collected  and used as part of marketing.
