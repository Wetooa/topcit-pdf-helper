01 Overview  of network  security
A) Concept  of network  security
@® Type of security  attacks
X.800 divides security  attacks into passive attacks and active attacks. A passive attack means that an
attempt  is made to obtain and exploit system information,  but system resources  are not affected.  An active
attack aims to change  system  resources  and affect system  operations.
+ Passive  attack
A passive attack refers to the eavesdropping  or monitoring  of transmitted  data and is attempted  to obtain
the transmitted  data. As shown in [Figure 53], passive  attacks  include message  content  disclosure  and traffic
attack. Traffic attacks  can also be made against  encrypted  data transmission  for confidentiality.  This attack
estimates  the nature of communication  by observing  the number  and length of message  exchanges.
The passive attack has the characteristic  that it is difficult  to detect, because  the attack does not change
data. Therefore,  prevention  is more important  than detection.

+ Active attack
An active attack can be classified  into masquerading,  replay, modification  of message,  and denial of service
(DOS) attack,  which entail the illegal modification  of transmitted  data or the creation  of false data.
Masquerading  occurs when one entity pretends  to be another. In general, the masquerading  attack is made
together  with one of the other active attack  types.
The replay attack acquires  one message,  by using an inactive  attack method,  and sends the message  again
to obtain unauthorized  results.
