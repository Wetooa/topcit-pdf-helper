Company  A specializes  in developing  embedded  systems  that control industrial  equipment  and home
appliances.  Since embedded  systems  are applicable  to a wide range of devices,  such as sensors,  controllers,
and loT devices,  they are the core technology  required  from the market  development  stage. An embedded
system is a solution  built into a product  to perform  specific  tasks. Developers  of such systems  must have a
broad knowledge  of software  and hardware  functions.  This chapter  describes  embedded  systems  in detail.
01 Overview  of Embedded  System
A) Definition  of embedded  system
An embedded  system is a computer  system that performs  a specific function  for controlling  a machine  or other
systems  requiring  control,  and an electronic  system in the device.
In more detail, it is a system with a built-in microprocessor  and a program  that drives the microprocessor  to perform
a specific  function,  more than just simple circuits in various  electronic  devices,  home appliances,  and control devices
used in our daily life.
An embedded  system is configured  of a set of hardware  and software,  as shown in [Figure 71].
+ Embedded  hardware:  Embedded  hardware  consists  of a microprocessor/microcontroller,  equivalent  to a CPU,
memory,  input/output  device, network  device, sensor, driver, etc.
+ Embedded  software:  Embedded  software  consists  of an operating  system (OS) that directly  controls  hardware  and
manages  the software,  system software,  and application software.  Unlike conventional  software,  the main purpose
of the embedded  software  is to provide an appropriate  response  to the physical  world. Therefore,  embedded
software  has the characteristics  of the physical  world, such as time, energy,  and permanence.
