applications  can be connected.  As the characteristics  and purchasing  patterns  of customers  who seek and pay for
goods using their smartphones  are accumulated,  they are released  through  the API and all the member  companies
get to jointly use the marketing  data collected  by each of the other members.
App developers  will also be able to utilize the API open data as a business  asset to build new applications  and provide
a variety of customized  services  to consumers.  Since 2010, E*Trade  has been providing  its stock trading  service to
partner  companies  through  an API. Its partner  companies  have been able to sell, order, or view a portfolio  on behalf of
its customers.
In addition,  E*Trade  has made it possible  for its customers  to use the company’s  service without  requiring  them to
visit its website.  Through  this strategy,  E*Trade  has elevated  the quality  of its service  and is providing  it very stably.
In the United States, IT companies  such as Amazon,  Twitter, and Google are also generating  revenue  by releasing
their data and services  through  APIs. By sharing their APIs (their core assets) through  their respective  business
ecosystems,  these companies  are able to maximize  their internal/external  efficiencies  and raise expectations  of new
revenue  generation.  But the task of developing  and managing  APIs is not easy and even after APIs are released,
essential  management  tasks such as account  management,  authentication,  and security  management  have to be
taken care of. Since the number  and diversity  of APIs released  by companies  are increasing  every year, systemized
management  of APIs is something  that companies  are being called upon to commit  to.

[Fig. 54] API value chain
The API value chain must be understood  before API can be used as a business  model. In other words, enterprise  data
and services  are released  through  APIs, and third-party  developers  create innovative  applications  by using the open
API. Companies  that provide APIs must also understand  the requirements  of third-party  developers  who use APIs
directly  and the even the needs of the application  users.
Internally,  an enterprise  must have a system in place for monitoring  and managing  the released  APIAn enterprise
should also be able to provide formal documents  or websites  where developers  can contact  each other so that
external  developers  can easily understand  and use the APIs.
In an era when mobile devices ranging  from smartphones  to tablets and smart watches  are deeply embedded  in our
daily lives, companies  should be able to manage  different  forms of customer  contact  points through  strategic  API
management.
