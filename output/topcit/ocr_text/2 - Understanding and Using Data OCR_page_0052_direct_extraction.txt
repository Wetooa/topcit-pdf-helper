01 Concept  and Procedure  of Data Modeling
“Data modeling”  refers to the process  of abstracting  the real world to create a database  and is performed  according
to the following  procedure:  requirements  analysis,  conceptual  modeling,  logical modeling,  and physical  modeling.  That
is, modeling  refers to a technique  of expression  that uses a certain notation  to abstract,  simplify,  and clarify the real
world.
<Table 20> Characteristics  of modeling
Item Contents
Abstraction Expresses  the real world according  to a certain format.
Simplification Expresses  the real world using agreed protocols,  or limited notation  and language.
Clarification alee ambiguity  and accurately  describes  a phenomenon  so that everyone  can understand  it
A) Requirements  collection  and analysis
+ A phase in which ambiguity  is removed  from the requirements  by collecting  and analyzing  the business
requirements.
+ Arequired  specification  (or job description)  is produced  as a deliverable.
B) DB design
Design in the order of conceptual  modeling  -> logical modeling  -> physical  modeling.
C) Differences  in the academic  world’s  and industry's  understanding  of conceptual/logical  modeling
@ Understanding  the academic  world
* Conceptual  modeling  is the phase in which an ERD is produced,  whereas  logical modeling  is the phase in which the
structural  drawing  of the table is produced.  These two phases are clearly separated.
+ Therefore,  the entities  and relationships  of the ERD are identified  in the conceptual  modeling  phase, and the primary
keys and foreign keys of the table are identified  in the logical modeling  phase.
+ Normalization  that handles  table structure  should be performed  in the logical modeling  phase.
+ For reference,  “physical  modeling”  refers to the process  of creating  tables suitable  for an actual DBMS.
+ The Chen type of ERD is mainly used.
+ The relationship  itself can have its own properties  in the ERD.
+ All information  shown in the table structure  drawing  is also shown in the ERD.
@ Understanding  of the industry
+ An ERD is produced  during logical modeling.
+ Conceptual  modeling  further  abstracts  the ERD and summarizes  it at a comprehensive  level including  the subject
area, core entity, core relationship,  and core attribute.  Conceptual  modeling  is not studied  in the academic  world.
+ The Crow's Foot type of ERD is mainly used.
