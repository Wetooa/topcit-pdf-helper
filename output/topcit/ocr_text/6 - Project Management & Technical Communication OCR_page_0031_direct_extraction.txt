Employee  P met a very tough manager  on his first project.  The manager  rarely approved  a report
from not just Employee  P, but anyone  else. The manager  would quibble  about “Why is this like
this?”, “What evidence  is this supported  by?” Or yell "Why is it so complicated?",  "What  on earth are
you doing?"
Of course, reports  written by Employee  P would always be marked  with the color red meaning  errors.
Employee  P, who was wondering  “Do | lack skills?” or “What is the problem?”  got to realize, “Oh, |
didn't think that the ultimate recipient  of my report was the CEO, not my manager!’  In other words,
he realized  that the final reporter  of the report made by Mr. P was not himself,  but his manager.
From then on, Employee  P set the standards  for making reports like this. He first thought,  "How
much does the CEO know?" and "Will the manager  be able to understand  this document  easily?”,  and
he started creating  the document,  imagining  the manager  reporting  to the CEO. In particular,  when
reporting  to the manager,  he prepared  the grounds  or materials  for the questions  the CEO would be
curious about. In other words, keeping in mind thought  that the CEO is not an expert in the field,
he picked out the questions  that those with general knowledge  might ask and the corresponding
answers,  and submitted  them with the report to the manager.  Since then, Employee  P received
compliment  and better evaluation  on his work.
