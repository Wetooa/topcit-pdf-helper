ESSENCE
The Collect  Requirements  process  focuses  on what needs to be developed.  Of course,  “What” is important,  but
understanding  the “Why it needs to be developed”  is more important.  That way, you can avoid unnecessary
development  and focus more on what's important.
® Scope Definition
Scope definition  is a process of identifying  the key scope of the project after requirements  collection  and
defining  the scope based on a common  understanding  of the business  functions  to be included  in the project.
Scope definition  is a process of formulating  detailed scope statements  for projects  and products.  The scope
statement  specifies  the criteria for outputs and delivery,  and includes  characteristics  such as exclusions,
constraints,  and assumptions.  In other words, it is an activity  that clearly distinguishes  the boundaries  of the
project  scope from others.
The requirements  for scope definition are as follows:
+ Clear Scope: The project scope must be clearly defined. Being clear means that it is not interpreted
differently  from person to person. Clarity is fundamental  to other requirements:  being complete,  agreed-
upon, and manageable.
* Complete  Scope: Being complete  means that there should be no missing,  excessive,  or overlapping  parts.
+ Agreed-upon  Scope: Opinions  on the scope often vary depending  on the stakeholder.  The problem  is that if
there is a disagreement  of stakeholders  on the scope of the project during project execution,  the process
of coordinating  it causes various side effects. Therefore, the entire scope of the project must go through a
process  of collecting  opinions  of all stakeholders  and reaching  a consensus  before execution.
+ Manageable  Scope: WBS provides  a basic framework  for other plans. Therefore,  if the scope is not defined  to
be manageable,  it becomes  difficult  to incorporate  plans from other areas such as schedule,  budget,  etc. The
term “manageable”  specifically  means the following:
- Duration  and cost are accurately  estimated.
- The person in charge  is designated
- Performance  is evaluated  realistically.
@ Work Breakdown  Structure  Formulation
WBS is an output created by decomposing  deliverables  and the entire scope of the project into manageable
components.  WBS creation can be regarded  as the most important  not only for scope management,  but
also among  the entire project activities.  By breaking  down the tasks to be accomplished  by the project  team
and defining  the deliverables  for each stage of execution,  it is possible  to prevent  missing  tasks, identify the
relationship  between  tasks, and consistently  communicate  with stakeholders  and sponsors.
© Scope Identification
Scope identification  is the process  of confirming  approval  with the client or the project leader for deliverables
to be handed over to the client. For official validation  of the project scope, inspection and technical  review by
the project  team are conducted  to identify  defective  products,  specifications  and standards  and the confirmed
results are derived as outputs.
+ Inspection
It is an act to measure,  examine,  and confirm  performance  to check whether  the tasks and deliverables  meet
