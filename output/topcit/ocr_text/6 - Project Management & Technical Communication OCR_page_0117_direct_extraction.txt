01 Concept  of Quality  Control
A) Concept  of software  quality
@® Software  Quality
It refers to the characteristics  and productivity  of a software  product  that meets a given requirement.
@ Characteristics  of Software  Quality
Software  quality is a relative concept,  and it is difficult  to measure  quantitatively,  dependent  on several
resources  such as cost, time, manpower,  and tools, and correlated  with each other.
In order to measure  and evaluate  software  quality, a quality model that can first define elements  and
characteristics  representing  the quality of software  and quantify  quality in an objective  aspect in the
development  process  is required.  In general, such quality model is represented  in a hierarchical  structure.  The
first layer is composed  of quality  targets  from the user's point of view, the second layer is composed  of high-
level Quality Characteristics  that can achieve  the quality targets,  and the third layer is composed  of specific
Subcharacteristics.
<Table 51> ISO/IEC  9126-1 Quality  Characteristics
Quality  Characteristics Subcharacteristics
Functionality Suitability,  Accurateness,  Interoperability,  Compliance,  Security
Reliability Maturity,  Fault tolerance,  Recoverability
Usability Understandability,  Learnability,  Operability
Effectiveness Time behavior,  Resource  behavior
Maintainability Analyzability,  Changeability,  Stability,  Testability
Portability Adaptability,  Installability,  Conformance,  Replaceability
@ Major Standards  Related  to Software  Quality
There are ISO/IEC  9126, ISO/IEC 12207, CMMI, 6 Sigma, ISO 9000, etc.
@ Perspective  of Software  Quality  Evaluation
+ Product:  Quality  itself (measurement,  verification,  validation,  evaluation)
+ Process:  Process  improvement  and audit
B) Concept  of quality  control
© Definition  of Quality  Control
It refers to all techniques  and activities  performed  to preserve  the quality of a product  or service that satisfies
the user's requirements.
@ Quality  Control Process
It refers to the activities  and processes  performed  to establish  quality policies,  set quality  goals, and determine
quality-related  responsibilities  in order to meet user requirements  (Fitness  for use) in a project.
