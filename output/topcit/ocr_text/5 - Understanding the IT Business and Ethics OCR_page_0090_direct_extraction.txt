[Fig. 32] Conceptual  diagram  of supply  chain management
To implement  supply chain management  (SCM), an enterprise  must have in place some crucial functions  in supply
chain planning  (SCP) and supply  chain execution  (SCE).
@ Function  of SCM
SCM carries out the 3 functions  of supply chain planning,  supply  chain execution,  and supply  chain visibility.  These
three functions  form a positive  feedback  cycle, a structure  in which their functions  can be improved  when the working
environment  changes.
<Table38>Functions  of supply  chain management
Function Description
Establishes  the optimal  plan for the daily operations  of the supply  chain, such as demand
Supply Chain Planning forecasting,  global production  plan, transportation/delivery  plan, distribution  allocation plan, etc.
Enhances  the efficiency  of logistics  in the field, such as warehousing,  product  transport/delivery
Supply  Chain Execution management,  order management,  and distribution  management.  Manages  logistics  in the field
through  digital tools and interfaces  such as bar codes and RFID.
Monitors  the supply  chain, identifies  cost across the supply  chain, and performance,  looks out
Supply  Chain Visibility for anomalous  operations  from the service perspective,  and fulfills a preventive  function  by
recommending  corrective  actions.
@® Comparison  of SCM and ERP
SCM and ERP are the parts of the work support  system operated  by enterprises.  Logistics  and distribution
management  are the critical areas of SCM that are intimately  tied to ERP. In recent years, some ERP have been
implemented  with a part of the functionality  of SCM, but the detailed  flow is managed  by SCM.
