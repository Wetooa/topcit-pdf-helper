As of 2016, Korea’s computer  user rate was 85.7%, meaning  that more than 8 out of 10 people were
using computers.  During  the same period, the smartphone  user rate grew much faster than PCs, reaching
88.5%. With the rapid proliferation  of mobile devices,  the PC user rate is gradually  decreasing,  and the us of
laptopswhich  have gradually  replaced  desktops,  have also continued  to decline  after exceeding  30% for the
first time in 2014. Smartphones  and tablet PCs are increasingly  taking  over the place of computers.
Electronic  devices,  such as desktops,  laptops,  and smartphones,  are collectively  referred  to as “computers”
and they have things that are commonly  applied to them. They contain indispensable  software,  an
operating  system (OS), and major hardware.  Having  the best processor  and components  is useless  without
an OS. The OS is a medium  that delivers  close to 100% of the outstanding  performance  of a manufacturer's
computer  to users.
The elements,  such as the CPU, mainboard,  memory,  graphics  card, and storage  device, that make up a
computer  cannot  do anything  by themselves.  Users can get work done with a word processor  and can enjoy
playing  World of Warcraft,  only when the OS gives the commands  of what to do to each piece of hardware.
The operating  system, which is software,  is responsible  for the device operation  from start to finish. It is
the OS's role from the moment  it recognizes  the power supply, until it shuts off the power on command.
Without  an OS, the user must manually  turn the power on or off in an analog way, like the older products.
Commands  for device operation  are mechanical, and the device can only perform  one function  with an
input. In today’s  electronic  devices,  which have been mostly  converted  to operate  electronically,  the volume
and power buttons  remain manual.

01 Operating  System  (OS)
A) Overview  of OS
OS is a system software  that provides  a computer  resource  interface  to users or application programs  by efficiently
managing  the limited resources  of computer  hardware.
The first computers  were set to operate single-purpose  programs,  as they did not have an OS. The programs
