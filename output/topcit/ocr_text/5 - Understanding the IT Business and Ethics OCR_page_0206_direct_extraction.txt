If a company's  trade secrets  are leaked, competitors  can easily produce products  and engage in dumping
using the leaked trade secrets, which can lead to a business  crisis and intensify  competition  between
companies.
According  to the results of the Korea Intellectual  Property  Office's survey of 616 domestic  companies
in 2017 on the trend and actual condition  of accidents  involving  technology  leakage, 67.4% (duplicate
response)  of trade secret leaks occurred  in the event of employee  tumover,  and 81.4% were caused by
internal staff
It is analyzed  that the reason why the trade secret protection  system has not been activated  is because
in many cases, executives  and employees  in companies  related to trade secrets  do not know exactly  the
contents  of the Unfair Competition  Prevention  and Trade Secret Protection  Act, which regulates  trade
secrets.
According  to Article 2 (2) of the “Act on the Prevention  of Unfair Competition  and Protection  of Trade
Secrets”, the term "trade secret" means information,  including a  production  method,  sale method, useful
technical  or business  information for business  activities,  that is not known publicly, is the subject of
reasonable  efforts  to maintain  its secrecy,  and has independent  economic  value:
Violation  of trade secrets is subject  to criminal penalties.  Imprisonment  for up to 5 years is imposed  for
domestic  cases and up to 10 years for overseas  cases. Along with imprisonment,  there are fines. In addition,
even if trade secrets are not actually leaked, any person who has attempted,  or intends or conspires  to
commit  a crime can be punished.
Even if companies  reinforce  security  technologies  to protect  technology,  trade secrets  are leaked by people,
so it is necessary  to prepare  for them.
