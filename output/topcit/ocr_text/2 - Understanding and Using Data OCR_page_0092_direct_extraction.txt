0S Distributed  Database
A) Characteristics  of the distributed  database
@A distributed  database  refers to a database  that is logically  integrated  and shared so that users can recognize  it as a
single database  even though  it is physically  distributed  among  multiple  computers  on a network.
@ The distributed  database  management  system refers to a system that exchanges  and manages  the information  of
each local database  so that multiple  databases  can be recognized  as one logical database.  ([Figure  38])

© Strengths  of the distributed  database
+ Reduces  dependence  on remote  data by controlling  its data locally.
+ Large volumes  of data can be processed,  which is impossible  in a single server.
+ Scale-up  is supported  by adding  a server  to the existing  system.
+ Reliability  and availability  are improved  because  even if one site fails, only the data in that site cannot  be used.
@ Shortcomings  of the distributed  database
+ Distributed  processing  increases  complexity,  which in turn increases  software  development  costs.
+ Weak control  functions.
+ Increased  possibility  of error due to distributed  processing.
+ The response  speed may vary depending  on the condition  of the system in which data is physically  stored,
* It is difficult  to completely  ensure  data integrity.
B) Data transparency
@ To recognize  multiple  physical  databases  as a single logical database,  users do not need to know where the data are
physically  located  or how to access  it.
@ This characteristic  is called “data transparency’,  and the distributed  database  management  system provides
partitioning,  location,  replication,  failure, and concurrency  transparency.
