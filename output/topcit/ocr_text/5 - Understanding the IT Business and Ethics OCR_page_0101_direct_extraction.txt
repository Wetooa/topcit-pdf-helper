ESSENCE
+ This is an analytical  tool developed  to consistently  solve similar  types of problems.  Quantified  models
ilcridanel perform complex calculations  that result in increased efficiency  and accuracy of problem solving.
system + Model base management  systems include statistical models, forecasting  models, linear planning
models,  simulation  models,  etc.
Knowledge  base + This system provides support  for solving unstructured  decision-making  problems  that are difficult  toa quantify  through the role of providing  qualitative  information.
User interface « The user interface  is a window  that includes  all forms of communication  between  the decision
management maker  and the decision-maker  support  system. The interface  ensures  flexibility,  performance,  and
system convenience.
@ DSS data model
The data model in the DSS provides  a framework  for analyzing  data, along with the data with which decision  makers
can make rational  decisions.  Different  types of data models are generated  from different  types of algorithms  and are
continuously  being developed  and improved.  In recent  years, the DSS has been evolving  in the direction  of actively
employing  Al for better  forecasting,  and the types of models  are also diversifying.
<Table  47> Types  of DSS data models
Type of model Description
For a specific  resolution  method,  the what-if  analysis  investigates  how changes  in a given
What-if  Analysis variable  could impact  another  variable.  This is a useful technique  for testing  assumptions
about uncertain  future situations.
This is a technique  for observing  how changes  to one or two variables  affect the rest of the
Sensitivity  Analysis variables  in an equation model consisting  of input and result variables.
. After setting  a goal, this technique  is used to find the values of variables  that will enable anGoal-seeking :enterprise  to achieve  its goal.
oe 5 This i hnique for ining  th imal  value  of  one or more tar; riables given Optimization  Analysis s is a technique  for obtaining the optimal  value  of one or more target  variables  given a
particular  constraint.
C) Understanding  BI
@® Concept  of BI
Business  intelligence  (Bl) is a set of processes  that seeks to improve  the quality  of business  decisions  and business
performance  through  the summarization,  analysis  and use of enterprise  data and information.  If the DSS is the
system for decision makers, and the traditional  concept  is a support system for decision-making,  then BI is the
decision  support  system  that can be adopted  for use by regular  employees.
+ In the narrow sense of the term, BI is a system that improves  the quality of decision-making  in business
management  and improves  the performance  of a business  by summarizing  and analyzing enterprise  data and
information.
+ Intelligence  is the ability to understand  the interrelationships  between  given facts, which could produce  guidance  for
achieving  a desired  goal. (Hans Luhn, IBM, 1958)
+ The general consensus  is that today’s BI evolved from the DSS. Analysis  technologies  such as data warehouses,
OLAPs,  and BI began to be developed  in the late 1980s based on the DSS.
