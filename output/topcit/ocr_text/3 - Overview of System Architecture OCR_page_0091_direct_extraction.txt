of the moving  head. It can reduce the response  time variation  of SSTF, and it generally  offers excellent  throughput
per unit time and mean response  time. On determining  the heading  direction,  the head services  all the requests
waiting  in the request  queue in the same direction  as the order of the shortest  search distance,  and it changes  the
seeking  direction  after it reaches  the outermost  or innermost  cylinder. It has improved  both the throughput  per unit
time and the response  time significantly  compared  to SSTF, and it solved the starvation.

The technique  is the same as the SCAN disk scheduling,  except  that the head changes  its direction  before reaching
the outermost  or innermost  cylinder. It checks the waiting queue while moving  the head, and it does not move
further it changes  direction  when there are no more requests  in the moving  direction.

@ Circular  SCAN (C-SCAN)  disk scheduling
The SCAN technique  moves the head by connecting  the inner and outer tracks in a circular  model. Like SCAN disk
scheduling,  the head services  the request  with the shortest  distance  in its moving  direction  first, then it moves  to the
initial direction  to service requests  after all the requests  in the moving  direction  are serviced.  It services  all requests
in a predetermined  service direction.  Since it responds  equally  to input and output requests  by improving  the SCAN
scheduling,  the response  time variation  is very small, making  it easy to predict  the response  time.
Circular  LOOK (C-LOOK)  disk scheduling
Like C-SCAN,  it is a LOOK scheduling  technique  that connects  the inner and outer tracks in an annular  model in order
to make the head move. The head moves to the initial beginning  position  and services  the next requests,  if there are
