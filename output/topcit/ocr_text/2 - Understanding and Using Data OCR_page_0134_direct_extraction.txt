Coordinator CoordinatorCommit
+ Step 1: When  a transaction  is started  by transaction  coordinator  C, coordinator  C sends a message  asking  whether
the transaction  can be completed  to databases  A and B, and database  A and B reply  with the “ready” status.
+ Step 2: If all participating  databases  are “ready’, the coordinator  sends a “completion  (commit)’  signal. If one or more
participating  databases  signals a “not ready (abort)’  signal, the coordinator  sends  a “cancellation  (abort)’  signal.
