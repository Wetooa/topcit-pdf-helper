Overview  of System Architecture )
As shown in [Figure 13], these protocols specify communication  with the same protocol layers of other hosts
connected  through a network.  For communication,  a header  for the exchanging  of data between  protocols  of the
same layer with data downloaded  from the layer immediately  above are generally  required.
As shown in [Figure 15], an application  layer can transmit  the user data through  a transport  protocol  TCP (or UDP),
which is an end-to-end  protocol  connected  to the other host. It requires  a TCP header  (or UDP header).
The transmission of user data, including a  TCP header, uses IP, which is a network  layer protocol  that has routing
information  to the network  of the other host, and the IP head has the information.
The network  layer considers  both the TCP header  and the user data received  from the transport  layer as data. The
data link protocol,  which has the necessary  information  for physical  delivery  to other hosts in the same network,
mostly uses Ethernet.  In that case, both the TCP header  and the user data, including  the Ethernet  header  with the
necessary  information  and the IP header  downloaded  from the network  layer, are regarded  as data. It should be noted
that each layer uses only the header  that corresponds  to the given function.

03 Internet  Address  System
Internet  users come across many terms related to numbers, such as a MAC address,  an IP address,  and a port
number.  It is unnecessary  to memorize  these numbers,  but understanding  the numbers  helps figure out each layer
protocol.  The MAC address,  IP address,  and port number  in the Internet  address  system  have the following  meanings:
@ MAC address:  The MAC (medium  access control)  address,  or the address  system used by the data link layer, is used
to transfer  frames between  the physically  connected  nodes. The information  is generally  stored on the LAN expansion
card hardware,  called NIC. It is also called the physical  address  or Ethernet  hardware  address  (EHA). It is formed by48
bits. The first 24 bits represent  the hardware  manufacturer's  unique ID, and the remaining  24 bits represent  the NIC-
dependent  address.
@IP address:  The IP address  is the address  system of the network  layer to transfer  datagram  between  two hosts/
routers. It facilitates  data to be transferred  from the source node to the destination  node, through  multiple  Internet
networks.  While the MAC address  is a physical address,  the IP address  is a logical address.  Existing IP addresses,  or
