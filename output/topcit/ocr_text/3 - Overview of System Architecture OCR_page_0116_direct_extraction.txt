technology,  and query language  for the access to and modification  of structural  data. It is large-scale  storage  of
consolidated  data with minimum  duplication  and is used by multiple  users concurrently.  It provides  independence
between  application  programs  and data and efficient  access  to data through  queries.  The system  catalog  is the tool
for database  administrators  (DBAs) and a system  table that lists the definitions  or statements  of all data objects
stored in the database.  The leading  DBMS products  include  Oracle, MS-SQL,  PostgreSQL,  Maria DB, and Cubrid (see

02 Information  System  Capacity  Calculation
When implementing  an information  system,  many hardware  suppliers  or system integrators  use the items and rates
for sizing calculation,  based on their experience,  leading  to inaccurately  calculated  sizes.
Moreover,  since the hardware  size must be calculated  according  to the nature of the business,  load increase  rate, and
use frequency  by the users, it is difficult to determine  the appropriateness  of the hardware  size in the information
system  implementation  projects.
For that reason, hardware  sizing has usually been dependent  on the project contractor  or hardware  supplier. It has
gained relatively  low interest,  compared  to software  development,  although  the share of hardware  in the information
system  implementation  project  is very large in the total project  cost. Therefore,  there is no way to correct  it, even if a
