0? Connection  Trap
The connection  trap means that desired information  cannot  be accurately  found even though  a relationship  has been
established  in a data model. Representative  types include  the fan trap and the chasm trap.
A) Fan trap
@ The fan trap can occur when there are entity  types A, B, and C, and when there is an N:1 relationship  between  entities
Aand B, and a 1:N relationship  between  entities  B and C.
@ An example  of the fan trap is as follows.
+ [Figure 25(a)] shows a case in which each branch is composed  of several departments,  with several employees
belonging  to each branch.
+ The fan trap is found in this case because  the department  to which each employee  belongs  cannot  be known.
+ The fan trap can be removed  by modifying  it, as shown in [Figure  25(b)].
