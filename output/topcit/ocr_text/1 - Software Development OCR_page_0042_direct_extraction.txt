D) Tree and graph
© Tree
A tree is a hierarchical  data structure  with a hierarchical  relationship  between  elements.  It has a tree-like
structure  that expands  from top to bottom,  and the elements  have a one-to-many  relationship.
The topmost  node in a tree is called the “root node’, and the line connecting  the nodes is called the “edge”.
Child nodes having the same parent node are called “sibling  nodes’, and the tree created  when the edge to the
parent node is disconnected  is called a “subtree”.
