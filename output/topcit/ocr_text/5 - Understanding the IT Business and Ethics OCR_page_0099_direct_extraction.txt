B) Understanding  the DSS
@® Concept  of the DSS
As a system  that supports  decision  making,  the Decision  Support  System  (DSS) provides  interactive  dialogue  support
to decision  makers  during  the decision-making  process.
* This is an interactive  dialogue-based  system that assists decision-makers  with solving semi-structural  and non-
structural  problems  using data and analytical  models.
+ The core elements  of the DSS are the enterprise  data (both internal and external)  and the analytical  model for
processing  quantitative  data. These perform  a critical role in decision  making.
@ Characteristics  of the DSS
The key feature  of the DSS is its ability to solve non-structural  problems  through  interactive  dialogue.  Here, “interactive”
means that issues can be explained  or expressed  from many different  angles as desired by the user. The focus of the
DSS is on how analyzed  data should be represented.
