There is the supply chain management  (SCM) system,  which integrates  the entire supply chain from purchasing  to
production  and eventual delivery  to customers.  With SCM, an enterprise  can manage how many raw materials  to
purchase,  sort them into product  groups, and manufacture  products  in a timely manner  ready for delivery  when the
customers  need them.
Because  the analysis  of customers  is a critical factor of competition,  the customer  relationship  management  (CRM)
system is a solution on which enterprises  depend to properly  analyze customer  needs, enhance  the service for
customers,  and strengthen  customer  relationships  for additional  value delivery.
C) Business  strategy  and enterprise  solution
In enterprise  solutions,  communication  with customers,  product  management,  and process integration  should be
organically  linked. These aspects  must be comprehensively  managed  so that enterprises  can execute  their business
strategies  efficiently  and achieve  their business  goals.
The environment  surrounding  an enterprise  changes  fluidly every minute;as  such, enterprises  are always faced with
the challenge  of responding  nimbly in order to survive.  Thus, companies  have no other choice but to tailor and change
their strategies  to fit the environmental  changes.  The adoption  of enterprise  solutions  that satisfy  the strategic  goals
of an enterprise  is an unavoidable  choice.
There are countless  enterprise  solutions  required  by businesses.  However,  the solutions  that most enterprises
absolutely  need to deploy  or need to develop  on their own in one form or another  can be defined using just a handful
of solutions.  There are also situations  in which enterprises,  as they grow in scale, are forced to adopt a particular
solution  to meet the IT compliance  requirements.
