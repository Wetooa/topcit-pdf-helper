@ Professional  Ethics for Software  Developers
Programmer  and software  development  columnist  Pete Goodliffe  presents  the following  "Becoming  a Better
Programmer"®,  emphasizing  the ethical consciousness  of programmers.
<Pledge  to do no harm as an ethical programmer>
+ | swear | will not harm the code of ethics or business  for personal  and professional  gain.
+ | will do my best to perform  my assigned  tasks faithfully,  and will build team harmony.
+ | will be honest  with others and work towards  making  projects  and teams as efficient  and valuable  as possible.
Also, it asks you as a programmer  to check the following  questions  to check whether  you have professional  ethics.
1. Do you consider  yourself  an ethical programmer?
Is there a difference  between  an ethical programmer  and an ethical person?
2. \s it ethical to create software  that generates  enormous  wealth for bankers  at the expense  of those who don't know
how to create software?  Does it make any difference  depending  on whether  the trade practice  is legal or not?
3. What if you are using GPL code that requires  additional  disclosure  obligations  for your products,  but you do not fulfill
the obligations  of the license terms by withholding  the disclosure  of your own code?
Do you have to disclose  your company’s  code to meet the license terms? Or should you ask for an alternative
replacement  of closed source for the GPL code? Should  you become  a whistleblower  and report  a license violation  if
the product  has already  been shipped?  What if your employment  security  depends  on being silent about it?
4. What if you recognize  other programmers’  unethical  behavior?  If the programmer  is a co-worker,  a friend, someone
who has been asked for a referral, or a coder whom you have met but haven't  worked with, how does your answer
change?
5. How do software  patents  fit into the world of ethical programming?
6. Does your passion for software  development  affect how much you care about ethical issues? Will a passionate
programmer  behave more ethically  than a professional  coder?
It is difficult  for software  developers  to fully understand  how their code will be used and what the potential  risks may
be. In addition, it is difficult  to figure out what is right and what is wrong in a rushing  work environment.  In such an
environment,  a sense of professional  ethics gives a sense of duty and responsibility  for a job and can provide  guidance
for judgment  in the context  of moral dilemmas.
