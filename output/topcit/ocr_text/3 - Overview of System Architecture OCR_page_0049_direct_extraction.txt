+ The memory  occupied  by a process  can be shared, and another  thread can access the same memory  address  in a
multi-thread  system.
+ The cost of thread creation  and context  exchange  is more economical  than the process,
+ Threads  increase  the parallel attributes  of the process  and enable the utilization  of multiprocessors.

03 Process  Synchronization  and Deadlock
A) Concept  of process  synchronization
A race condition  refers to two or more parallel processes  simultaneously  accessing  and changing  the same data,
or the order of manipulating  the data affecting  the execution  result. In a race condition,  only one process  must be
protected  to manipulate  data, and process  synchronization  is necessary  for its protection.
B) Critical  section  problem
For process  synchronization,  each process  defines a critical section in a part of the code and performs  the task of
changing  the data that is shared with other critical section processes.  Two or more processes  that are mutually
exclusive  cannot run in the critical section at the same time. [Figure 21] shows the structure  of the critical and
remainder  sections.
do {
entry section
critical  section // Critical  section
exit section
remainder  section  // Remainder  section
} while (TRUE):
