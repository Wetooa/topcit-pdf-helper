Saa& is a service that lets people use applications  through  the Internet  and web browser.  Saas is one of the top
tier services  that cloud service companies  can provide and leading services  include Google’s  Gmail and MS Office
365. PaaS is a service that lets companies  provide as a service, an environment  for developing  and running  web
applications.  In order to provide this kind of service, the technologies  for app development  must be modularized  and
standardized.  Leading  Paa include Salesforce.com's  Force.com and Google's  Google App Engine. laaS is principally
an enterprise  service that provides  a virtualized  environment  of resources  like servers, storages,  and networks  to
companies  who are permitted  to use the resources  whenever  needed. laaS service requires the ability to build and
operate  servers for large data centers,  capital, and a very good electrical  grid environment.  Examples  of laaS include
Amazon  EC2 and S3, as well as Gabia’s  cloud hosting  service.
Cloud service  can be divided into one of the following  categories,  depending  on how it is configured.
- Public Cloud
- Private  Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
A public cloud is a service shared by multiple  users over the Internet,  and a cloud service provider  provides the
services  and has management  responsibilities.  A private cloud is an IT environment  that is exclusively  deployed  on
a company’s  or an organization’s  intranet. It is controlled  by the company  or organization.  Hybrid cloud is a form of
cloud service that has scalability  and combines  the best of public cloud services  and private cloud services,  It can be
used in parallel  for special  purpose  applications.
With cloud computing,  users can directly  purchase,  design and install without  the need for intervention  by an IT
manager.  By sharing  IT resources  that could be used by everybody,  cloud computing  improves  efficiency  and the cost
associated  with owning IT resources  could be avoided. Due to these advantages,  cloud computing  can be merged
with different  types of services  and evolve into new business  models.
© Virtualization
Virtualization  is the abstraction  of computer  resources  on a computer  and it could be defined as "a technique  for
hiding  the characteristics  of physical  computer  resources  from the method  other systems,  applications,  and end users
use when they interact  with the resources” It is a technology  that can create multiple logical resources  from a single
physical  resource  or create a single logical resource  from multiple  physical  resources.
+ Application  virtualization
+ Through  the virtualization  of applications  installed in individual  PCs, users gain immediate  access  to needed
applications  without  having  to install them on their PCs every time.
+ Desktop  virtualization
Server-side  desktop  virtualization  allows users to virtually own another  heterogeneous  desktop,  such as Windows
Vista and Windows  7.
Client-side  desktop  virtualization  enables  heterogeneous  virtual desktops  in PCs.
Desktop  virtualization  allows the separation  of personal  and corporate  workspaces.
