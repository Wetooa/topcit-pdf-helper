B) SW adoption  process,  ISO/IEC 12207
ISO/IEC 12207 is an international  standard  for the software  adoption  lifecycle.  It provides  a standardized  and
systematic  process  for acquiring,  supplying,  developing,  operating,  and maintaining  software.
ISO/IEC  12207 consists  of three main processes  and a detailed  procedure  for each process,
ISO/IEC 12207 defines all the processes,  activities,  and tasks that can be applied to the adoption  and development
of many different  forms of software,  but it contains no specifications  regarding  the naming,  form, and contents  of
the output. Therefore,  if ISO/IEC 12207 is used together  with SPICE (Software  Process  Improvement  and Capability
Determination)  or CMMI (Capability  Maturity  Model Integration),  not just the WHAT but the HOW of the SW adoption
process  can be learned.
@ Basic lifecycle  process
The basic life cycle process  consists  of five sub-processes  and provides  support  to the stakeholders  participating  in
the software  lifecycle  process.
