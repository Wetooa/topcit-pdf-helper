+ Renaming  file: A file name must be changeable,  and a renamed  file should exist at a point within the directory
structure.
C) Allocation  by a file system
A file system should consider  which space on the disk to use and quickly access the files. An OS's file system
generally  uses the contiguous  allocation,  linked allocation,  or indexed  allocation.
* Contiguous  allocation:
This method  arranges  files as a set of contiguous  addresses  on the physical  disk, as shown in [Figure  27] below. The
disk addresses  of stored files are defined linearly. This method  has the advantage  of a relatively  high reading  speed,
since the files are stored in contiguous  addresses.  However,  it creates  an external  fragmentation  problem.

[Figure  27] Contiguous  Allocation
+ Linked allocation
This method stores files in block units and links each block to a list, as shown in [Figure 28] below. The directory
keeps pointers  to the first and last blocks of the files. As shown in the figure, the directory  contains  9 and 25, which
are the first and last block pointers,  respectively.  Block 9 is linked to blocks 16, 1, 9, 10, and 25 in that order. This
method can solve the external  fragmentation  problem of the contiguous  allocation  method. However,  the linked
allocation  method is slow to read and requires  the area to store the pointers  separately,  since data blocks are
scattered  on the physical  disk. Moreover,  it can cause data errors if the linked pointer  data is lost or corrupt.
