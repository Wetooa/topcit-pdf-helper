Type Description
Modifying  multiple  classes  at_ | When minor changes  are required  in several related classes  each time a specific  class is
the same time modified.
Data clumps Data that should be handled  together  are not in one class.
Primitive  obsession Only basic types like int are used without  creating  a class.
Switch statements Operations  are split using a ‘switch’  statement  or an ‘if statement
Lazy class A ass that doesn’t  do much.
Speculative  generality Excessive  generalization  such as “Expansion  will be performed  someday’.
Class interface  mismatch The class interface  (API) is not appropriate.
Incomplete  library  class It is difficult  to use existing  library classes.
Parallel  inheritance  hierarchies Asub-class  should be created  in another  place of the class hierarchy  when a sub-class  is created.
Comment There are detailed  comments  to explain  the insufficient  code.
C) Typical refactoring  techniques
Refactoring  techniques Description
When there are code snippets  that can be grouped  together,  a separate  methodExtract  Method . .Method is created  with a name that clearly expresses  the purpose  of the code.
cleanup Replace  Parameter  with | If an object calls a method and passes the result to another  method as a
Method parameter,  the receiver  calls the method.
Extract  Class If one class is doing the task that should be performed  by two classes,  a new class is
Pnetiten created,  and the related fields and methods  are transferred  to it from the old class.
Transfer If a class has a function  that is used by some instances  only, a sub-class  isE | : : ’between Sue SMaEES created that manages  the functions  used by the instance only.
Objects If several clients are using the same subset of the interface of one class, theExtract  Interface .subset  is extracted  as an interface.
Name Rename  Method Aname  with a  built-in  type is changed  to a name that can deliver  the intent well
without  associating  with the type.
. Inline Method If the main text of a method  is as clear as the method's  name, delete the method
en after moving  the main text into the caller that calls the method.
Collapse  Hierarchy Integrates  the super class and sub-class  if they are not very different.
Replace  Magic Number  | If there is a numeric  literal that has special meaning,  a constant  is created  with
with Symbolic  Constant  | the name that reveals  the intent and the number  is replaced  with a constant.
Duplication Pull Up Field If two sub-classes  have the same field, the field is moved to the superclass.
If multiple sub-cl have the method that perf th k, the Pull Up Method multiple  sub-classes  have the me od that performs the same task, the
method  is moved to the superclass.
