B) Subversion  (SVN)
Subversion  is an open-source  version control system. It is also abbreviated  as “SVN” using the command  used
in the command-line  interface. Subversion  was first developed  by CollabNet  Inc. in 2000 to replace  the limited
CVS.
Currently,  it is being further  developed  with developer  communities  all over the world as a top-level  Apache
project. Subversion  is based on  the server-client  model. The server can run in a working  computer  or in
a separate  computer  connected  over the network.  In the case of centralized  version control systems  like
Subversion,  multiple  clients check-out  and use files from the central server.
C) Distributed  repository  (Git)
Distributed  version control systems  such as Git copy the entire repository,  instead of directly  downloading
the last snapshot  by the client. If a problem occurs at the server, the server can be restored using the copy
held by the client. In the case of a distributed  repository,  source codes can be saved in multiple  servers  or the
local PCs of multiple  developers,  rather than in just one central server. Therefore,  each server or PC becomes
a source code repository.  The source code saved in each repository  is not the same version, but the code is
stored in different  branches.  That is, branch versions  A, B, and C can be saved in the server A, whereas  branch
versions  A, C, and D can be saved in the server B. Therefore,  there is no concept  of a master version in the
system itself because  the branch versions  in each repository are all different  and the locations  for accessing
and retrieving  the source code are all different.
D) TFS (Team Foundation  Server)
Team Foundation  Server (TFS) is a Microsoft  product  that provides  various features,  such as source code
management  (Team Foundation  version control), reporting,  requirements  management,  project management
(agile software  development,  waterfall  model), automated  build, lab management,  testing, and release
management.  Although  TFS can be used as a backend  for numerous  integrated development  environments,  it
is designed  to offer the best benefits  when used as a backend  for Microsoft  Visual Studio or Eclipse (Windows
and non-Windows  platforms).  TFS is an integrated  repository  based on the SQL Server. TSF stores all
information  related to the software  development  activities  of the development  team - such as source codes,
deliverables,  development  activities,  etc. - to enable the team to collaborate  more effectively.
