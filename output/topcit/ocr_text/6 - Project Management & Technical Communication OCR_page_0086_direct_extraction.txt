Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
The scope is “the sum of products  and services provided  through  the project”  and means the range of work
or the work itself required  to successfully  complete  the project. The scope is divided into project scope and
product  scope.
+ Scope = project  scope + product  scope
Project scope refers to all the work required  to create products,  services,  and outputs  of specified  features
and functions.  The product  range refers to the features  and functions  of the product  distinguished  from other
products,  services,  and outputs.  The project scope is about how products  and services  are provided,  that is,
the HOW aspect, and the product  range is about the product  and service itself, that is, the WHAT aspect. The
criteria for determining  whether  the scope is complete  differs for each project scope and product  scope. The
completion  of the project scope is measured  based on the project plan, and the completion  of the product
scope is measured  based on the product  requirements.
B) Scope management  process
The scope management  process proceeds  in the order of scope management  planning,  requirements  collec-
tion, scope definition,  work breakdown  system  (WBS) formation,  scope validation,  and scope control.
@® Scope Management  Planning
* Concept  of Scope Management  Planning
Project scope refers to tasks necessary  for project execution  in order to deliver products  and services,  which
are the final products  of the project, to customers,  and project scope management  is a process  to develop  a
project  scope management  plan to define, confirm,  and control the project  scope.
+ Project  Scope Management  Plan
The project scope management  plan defines  the process  to be carried out by the project stage and the level
of execution  of each process. The main items of the project scope management  plan are as follows, and the
scope plan should be shared between  the client and the service provider.
+ A procedure  to describe  project  scope
+ How to formulate  Work Breakdown  System(WBS)
+ Verification  and validation  criteria  for outputs  to be delivered  to customers
+ Explanation  on the format  and procedure  to request  for scope change
@ Collect  Requirements
In a project on the ground, it is important  to find out what the customer  needs and why they think they
need it. The following  is an example  of the development  of an F-16  fighter  jet in the 1970s on why collecting
requirements  is so important.
At the time, the F-16 fighter aircraft  was required  to fly at a speed of Mach 2.5. However,  the  fighter  jet, by
design, was not able to reach the speed above Mach 2. The designer  of the fighter  jet asked the U.S. Air Force
to clarify the speed requirement  as to why and received  a response  from the U.S. Air Force that it was to
improve  engagement  capabilities.  The designer  thought  that it would be possible  to improve  maneuverability
rather than speed to enhance  engagement  capabilities,  and applied fly-by-wire,  integrated  canopy, digital
avionics, etc., ultimately  meeting  the requirement  of “improving  engagement  capabilities’.
On the other hand, there were cases of Soviet military  aircraft  at the time. Soviet  fighter  jets were required to
be the fastest  in the world. The fighter  aircraft  built to fly at a speed of Mach 3.25 was too fast to be shot down
from outside,  but as being too expensive,  short-lived  and poorly suited for combat,  it was retired early in 1980.
