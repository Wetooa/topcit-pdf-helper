@ Native type
This type installs a VMM on physical hardware  and requires  no host OS. It saves resources,  compared  to the
virtualization  requiring  a host OS, since there is no host OS. The native type is also called type1. The leading  native
virtualization  technologies  include Xen, XenServer  from Citri, ESXServerBMWare,  Power Hypervisor  from IBM, and
Hyper-V  and KVM from Microsoft.

@ Hosted  type
The hosted hypervisor  (see [Figure 96]) is software  installed  on an existing  OS. The leading hosted type hypervisor
includes  VirtualPC  from Microsoft,  Workstation  from VMWare,  and VirtualBox  from Oracle.

C) Server  virtualization  methods
According  to the virtualization  method,  server  virtualization  technology  can be classified  into full virtualization,  para-
virtualization,  and OS-level  virtualization.
