Information  security )
+ Securing  independence  between  VMs
A system  should be protected  by utilizing  the strengths  of a V's virtual network  security  against  the threat
to the shared repository  and shared network  to the maximum  extent, and complete  isolation between  the
VMs accessed  by users should be provided.
+ Attack and intrusion  detection
Attacks and intrusions  should be detected  by applying  the hypervisor  type detection  technique,  which
analyzes  the internal state of each virtual machine  and detects  intrusions  using the hypervisor,  and the VM
type detection  technique,  which is an agentless  virtual security  detection  technique.
C) Big data security
@® Overview  of big data security
As big data is introduced  at a rapid rate, the risk of personal  information  leakage is also increasing  because
an enormous  amount  of customer  information  is collected  and concentrated.  Unlike existing  data types, big
data extensively  collects and analyzes  sensitive  personal  information,  such as credit information,  location
information,  and behavior information.  Therefore,  the scope and scale of a leakage incident  are inevitably
enlarged  if it occurs. Hence, security  should be ensured  most of all to spread the use of big data in the financial
sector. The safe management  of big data by lifecycle,  from big data collection  to destruction,  is important.
@ Security  threat and response  by the phase of the big data lifecycle
+ Big data collection  phase
If the data of a specific individual  is to be collected,  the individual’s  personal  information  should be de-
identified  if it is not allowed  by the law or agreed to by the owner in advance.
When collecting  big data using active data collection  technologies,  such as Chukwa,  Scribe, and Flume, the
owner of the data to be connected  should consent,  and access  controls  should be applied to the data. When
using passive data collection  technologies,  such as Web Robot or Web Crawler, robot exclusion  standards
should be complied  with.
+ Big data storage  and management  phase
Data should be encrypted  using a cryptographic  technique  suitable for data distribution  and replication,
technical  and physical  access controls  should be applied, and data should be de-identified  through  data
filtering  before being stored.
+ Data processing  and analysis  phase
Data anonymization  techniques,  such as K-anonymity,  L-diversity,  and differential  privacy, should be used
to de-identify  data in the processing  and analysis  phase. Sensitive  information  should be processed  in an
encrypted  state, using order preserving  encryption,  operation  preservation  encryption,  etc. In addition,
privacy should also be protected  when mining big data, by using the Privacy Preserving  Data Mining (PPDM)
technique,  etc.
