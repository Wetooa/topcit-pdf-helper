Classification Explanation
+ Histogram  sorted by frequency  of occurrence  to prioritize  a problem
+ It is based on the principle  that relatively  frequent  causes  generally  lead to most of the problems  or
defects.

+ Diagram  designed  to represent  how the cause and effect relate to and affect each other
+ Known as Cause and Effect Diagram,  Fishbone  Diagram,  and Ishikawa  diagram, it is generally  used for
preventing  defects  in product  design and quality  to identify  possible  causes  for an effect.
