Director Kim of K System's  Online Bank Team decided  to develop  an information  system for the
Online Bank business.  For the development  of the information  system, he  decided  to select an IT
system developer  by preparing  a request  for proposal  as an ordering  agency  for the development  of
the Internet  bank system.
IT service  company  P selected  Mr. Hwang  as a Project Manager  (PM) of proposal  and business  to win
the order for the K-system’s  online bank business,  and prepared  and offered a proposal.  PM Whang
prepared  a proposal  presentation  to appeal that Company  P is qualified  for the implementation  of
the project.
Company  P obtained  the order for the online bank business,  prepared  a project business  plan for its
implementation,  prepared  the required documents,  and negotiated  and reached agreements  with
Director  Kim and the Online Bank Team.

customer  activity  along with system development.  Let's take a look at the creation,  characteristics,
