supply chain encompasses  the entire process  from order placement  and the supplying  of raw materials  needed for
the production  of goods, to the production  process,  distribution  network,  and final delivery  to the customer.
The biggest  problem  with the supply  chain is the whipping  effect, a phenomenon  in which decisions  that are made
further  up the supply chain result in a sudden expansion  of demand.  What this means is that a small change in the
end-consumer  demand  for a product  will cause a chain reaction  furtherup  the supply  chain, increasing  the demand
from retailers  to wholesalers,  then to manufacturers,  and finally to parts suppliers.

As shown in Figure 31 above, if a consumer  places an order for 10 goods to a wholesaler,  the wholesaler  will place
an order for 12 goods  just in case. The manufacturer  will in turn manufacture  15 goods just in case. In this way, the
supply chain will become  overstocked  and resources  will be wasted,  with unnecessary  investments  in manpower  and
facilities,
If market  demand  is transmitted in this way to the upper level of the supply chain, the demand  gets distorted  and
increases  variance at each step. In addition,  the supplier  who supplies  the raw materials  at the end of the value
chain becomes  exposed  to huge risks, which seriously  increases the inefficiency of the entire supply chain due
to the imbalance  in demand across the supply chain, ultimately  resulting  in surplus orders, excess inventory,  and
overinvestment.  Therefore,  supply chain management  is a strategy  that aims to maximize  efficiency  by rectifying  the
whipping  effect problem  and by eliminating  waste throughout  the supply  chain.
To be more specific, in supply chain management  the players in the supply chain cooperate  with each in managing
materials,  funds and information,  with the objective  of linking and integrating  the flow of all goods, services  and values
(purchasing,  manufacture,  allocation  and distribution)  from the suppliers  to the end customers.  The effects of these
activities  manifest  themselves  as a shortened  lead time and reduced  uncertainties  and variabilities.  It is the goal of
supply  chain management  to support  these activities  and address  the issues that arise in the supply chain.
It is a management  technique  that seeks to optimize inventory  management  and other such supply chain decisions
