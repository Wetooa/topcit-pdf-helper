IPv4 addresses  based on the 32-bit address system, faced exhaustion  as Internet  use increased  rapidly worldwide.
Although  the IPv6 address system based on 128 bits was introduced  to solve the problem,  IPv4 addresses  are still
mainly used. Although  the IANA (Internet  Assigned  Numbers  Authority)  was responsible  for IP address  allocation  in the
past, the ICANN (Intemational  Corporation  for Assigned  Names  and Numbers)  is currently  in charge.
© Port number:  The port number  used to transfer  messages  between  two processes  (running  applications)  is responsible
for the connection  between  the web browser  on user A’s computer,  shown in [Figure 10], and the webserver  program
on myserver.com.  The 16-bit number  system  can identify  up to 65,535 application  programs.  The port numbers  from
0 to 1023 are called well-known  ports and are allocated  by the IANA. Application  programs,  such as telnet and email,
use it for sending  and receiving  data. The port numbers  from 1024 to 49,151 are called registration  ports and, like well-
known ports, are mostly used by servers.  The Internet  chatting  protocol,  IRC (TCP port number  6667), and Git version
control system (TCP port number  9418) are examples.  The port numbers  from 49,152 to 65,535 are mostly used as a
temporary  number  by clients, and are called dynamic  ports or temporary  ports.
04 Internet  Standard
The IETF (Internet  Engineering  Task Force) is a leading  organization  responsible  for Internet-related  standards.  It
defines the basic protocols  for Internet  transmissions,  such as IP, TCP, and UDP, as well as the most widely used
protocols  in the Internet application  layer protocols,  such as HTTP. SSH, FTP, SMTP. POP3, and IMAP. <Table 3> lists
other international  organizations  responsible  for Internet-related  standardization.
