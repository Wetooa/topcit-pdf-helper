object in the same way as if a directory  and files were combined  and treated  as a directory  entry.
- Advantages:  Convenient  because  the basic object and the constituent  object do not have to be separated
when writing  a source code.
+ Decorator  pattern
- Definition:  A class structure  used to dynamically  add a function  to a specific  object or to delete the added |
function.
- Advantages:  Quite simple and flexible  when adding  a function  to an object.
+ Facade  pattern
- Definition:  When several classes  have a close relationship  and play a role as a whole, this method  enables
the user to receive  the desired  function  using the representative  class even when no class to represent  the
role has been defined,  and external  clients  do not directly  handle each class.
- Advantages:  A simple interface  can be provided  for a complex  subsystem. A complex  or recursive
dependency  relationship  can be removed  by stratifying  the dependency  relationship  between  classes.
