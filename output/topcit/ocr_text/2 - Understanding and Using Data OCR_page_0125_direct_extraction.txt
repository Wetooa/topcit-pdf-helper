continue  due to a fatal error in the middle of the transaction  or because  the user issues a rollback  command.
D) Considerations  when executing  a transaction
@® Implementation  of transaction  concurrency:  Simultaneous  execution  of transactions  can increase  concurrency  by
increasing  the transaction  throughput  and system utilization  ratio and by reducing  latency.
@ Executing  a transaction  as quickly as possible:  If a transaction  takes too long, there is a high possibility  that conflicts
and deadlocks  will occur due to the long locking  time. Locking  should be maintained  long enough  to ensure transaction
serialization,  but should be executed  quickly  enough  so as not to deteriorate  performance  at the same time.
02 Concurrency  Control
A) Definition  of the serializable  schedule  of the transaction
MA serializable  schedule  means that even if each transaction  is executed  at the same time, the result is the same as
the sequential  execution  of the transaction.
@ Guaranteeing  the serialization  of transactions.

B) Definition  of concurrency  control
@ A function  that enables  the successful  execution  of several transactions  at the same time in a database  system that
supports  a multi-user  environment.
@A database  system  that supports  a multi-user  environment  must have this function,  which is also called concurrency
control,
C) Purposes  of concurrency  control
© To create a serializable  schedule  or ensure the possibility  of transaction  serialization.
@ To guarantee  the maximum  sharing  level, minimum  response  time, and maximum  system  activity.
@ To ensure data integrity  and consistency.
