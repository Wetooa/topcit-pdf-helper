the Al market?  - Targeting  based on parallel processing  capability  and
market domination, Google looking  to improve  power efficiency  using
TPU”, Monthly  Electronic  Parts News
Competition  in parallel processing  technology  is intensifying  as Al has emerged  as a core technology  of the
4th Industrial  Revolution.  While existing  programs  were implemented  by a CPU-based  serial (sequential)
processing  method,  GPU-based  programs  use parallel processing  technology,  which simultaneously
processes  multiple  instructions  and is used to implement  deep learning  of Al. Google is increasing  the
parallel processing  capability  by adding  its own processor,  called TPU.

01 Parallel  Processing  System
A) Concept  of the parallel  processing  system
Parallel processing  refers to one or more independent  operating  systems  managing  multiple processors  and
performing  multiple  tasks. There are separate  programming  languages  and syntax for parallel processing.  Parallel
processing  is very fast and can  share the memory  unit. Since several processors  operate it, the impact of failed
hardware  parts on the entire system is small. It is widely used in the field of Al, consisting  of a lot of data and
repetitive  complex  operations,  military equipment  that is needed to obtain accurate  results in a short time, and
searching  services  that extract  results from a wide range of data in a short time. Flynn’s  taxonomy  and classification
by memory  structure  are leading  examples  of parallel processing  system  classification.
