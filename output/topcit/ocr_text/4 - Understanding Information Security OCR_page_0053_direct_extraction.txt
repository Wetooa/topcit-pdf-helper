E) Spear phishing
@® Concept  of spear phishing
An attacker  sets key personnel  working  in the company  (those who access confidential  data, critical systems,
etc.) as an attack target, rather than the system or network  of an organization  with well-established
information  security  systems.  The attacker  sends spear phishing  emails, based on the collected  information  on
the target, in the attack preparation  stage. After acquiring  the device authority  of key personnel,  using social
engineering  techniques,  the attacker  hijacks account  information  (ID, passwords,  etc.) by monitoring  the device
for several months  or by control major systems  and networks  using remote control tools.
@ Countermeasures  against  spear phishing
Awareness  and response  training  on spear phishing  should be implemented  for key personnel,  such as
security  managers,  web server operators,  end users, etc. In particular,  web server operators  should prepare
countermeasures,  such as the detection  of malicious  code distribution,  operation  of the web firewall, and web
server security  measures.  For application  programs  and operating  systems,  security  vulnerabilities  should be
continuously  monitored,  and security  patches  should be periodically  applied.
F) Cryptojacking
@® Concept  of cryptojacking
Cryptojacking  is a compound  word of cryptocurrency  and hijacking.  Hackers  mine virtual money using the users’
PC. An attacker  infects a user's PC with malware  to mine cryptocurrency,  by consuming  the infected PC, or
hacks and infiltrates  into a website  and inserts  a malicious  script (JavaScript)  to mine cryptocurrency.
@ Countermeasures  against  cryptojacking
+ Keep the anti-virus  program  up-to-date  and check for malware  infection  on a regular  basis.
+ Use browser  extensions, such as AntiMiner,  NoCoin,  MinerBlock,  etc.
+ Block malicious  sites, such as coinhive.com,  using an IP firewall or writing detection  rule script in security
equipment  (IDS/IPS).
G) Ransomware
@® Concept  of ransomware
Ransomware  is a compound  of ransom and software.  Ransomware  disables  the system or encrypts  data
to demand money, by taking said system or data hostage.  Ransomware  became popular since the first
ransomware  AIDS in 1989. Ransomware  became  a serious  social issue after the distribution  of the Korean
version of CryptoLocker  in 2015. If the attacker's  demand  is not accepted  within the specified  period, ransom
