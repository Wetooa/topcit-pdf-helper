Company  A has recently  launched  a new system,  but recognized  that its hardware  capacity  is about 30%
insufficient  during a service.  An investigation  found that the concurrent  user calculation  of some services
was inaccurate,  leading to incorrect  hardware  capacity  selection.  The current infrastructure  is expected
to face inadequacy  within three to four months if the company  operates  the system as is. Therefore,
Company  A’s Planning  Team decided to allocate the additional  budget to expand the infrastructure  in
two months.  This case shows the practical  importance  of calculating  the information  system capacity,
according  to its structural  design and system structure.  This chapter  describes  information  structure  and
size calculation  in detail.
01 Information  System  Structure
A) Concept  of information  system
An information  system uses information  technology  (IT) to perform  business  procedures,  such as providing  necessary
information, or business  processing  required  by enterprises.  It creates a system that enables  IT personnel  to provide
IT services  by using IT components,  such as hardware  and software,  to perform  organizational  business  procedures.
As shown in [Figure 75], the information  system provides  services  by using the technology  resources  of the IT
infrastructure.  The IT infrastructure  includes  computing  platforms,  such as networks,  hardware,  software,  IT personnel,
and IT services.
