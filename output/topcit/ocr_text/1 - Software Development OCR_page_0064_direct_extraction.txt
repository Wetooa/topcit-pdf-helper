Software  Development }
+ Preview  for practical  business Roles of the software  architect
«Creator  of a vision - The requirements  and constraints  should be well understood  and
understanding  of the realized  technologies  should be improved,  based on a professional
perspective  and experience  in the type of product  to be made. A software  architect  plays the
role of completing  the framework  of the software  to be developed.  The architect’s  creativity  is
important,  and the architect  should be able to present  what has been arranged.
+ Key technical  consultant  - A key technical  consultant  advises  the development  organization
regarding  technical  matters,  based on his or her expertise.  It is particularly  important  to
properly  select a design pattern and a development  framework  because  it is the first step in
ensuring  that the quality  of a software  product  is commensurate  with its characteristics.  To this
end, continuous  knowledge  realization  and competency  development  are required.
+ Decision  maker  - Ultimately,  an architect  leads a design team in the development  of a software
product  and makes decisions  about major areas or factors  that affect the overall design.  To this
end, increasing  knowledge  about the domain  in which the product  will be used or applied  is also
defined  as an important  factor.
Recently,  this role has become  more important,  given that a proper  decision  appropriate  to the
situation  must be made quickly  and evaluated,  such as agile development,  etc.
+ Coaches  - Similar to the role of the key technical  consultant  (described  as the second role),
the coach trains the defined  architecture  and manages  its improvement  and feedback.  The role
of the coach, as a technical  leader, and coaching  is exercised  by various sponsorships  and its
position  is also strengthened.
+ Coordinates  - The different  opinions  of the various  project participants  should be coordinated
and mediated  to maintain  and ensure design integrity.  A person who can mediate  from the
technical  standpoint  is required  because  these factors may develop  into an important  risk
factor. An architect  can be seen as an authoritative  technical  mediator  in this regard.  Therefore,
proper  communication  skills are also important,  in addition  to technical  competence.
+ Implements  - When introducing  a new technology,  its impact should be evaluated  from
the design stage, and the feasibility  of its implementation  should also be evaluated  using a
prototype.  Generally,  developers  grow into architects  by improving  their skills and experience.
+ Advocates  - New architecture  should be continuously  evaluated  and a ground for introducing
and continuous  investment  should be provided.  Technical  skills and architecture  should be
advanced  continuously  through  this.
