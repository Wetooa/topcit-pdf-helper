+ When including  the source code under GPL 3.0 in the user’s product  or distributing  it with the user's product,
installation  information  should be provided  with the source code.
The interests  related to DRM, which are protected  by the laws of each country, should be waived. If a
contributor  has improved  the source code, that contributor  should provide a license stating that his/her
contribution  is non-discriminatory  and does not require any fee with regard to the patent.
@® LGPL (Lesser  General  Public License)
The LGPL enables  users to use some libraries  in a way that the source code can be used in a more eased form
than the GPL. If a strict license such as the GPL is applied,  commercial  software  developers  will be reluctant  to
use the open-source  library because  they have to open the source code of the software  that uses the library.
In other words, the LGPL is designed  to encourage  the use of an open-source  library from a strategic  point of
view. The main matters  to comply  with are as follows.
+ When linking an application  program  with the LGPL library (both static and dynamic  linking), developers  do
not have to open the source code of the application  program  concerned.
+ The patent is handled  in the same way as the GPL.
@ BSD (Berkeley  Software  Distribution)  license
The BSD license is a representative  open software  license that does not require the developer  to disclose  the
software  source code. The scope of BSD license permission  is wide because  projects  deployed  with the BSD
license have been implemented  using the financial  resources  provided  by the U.S. government.  As the software
was paid for with the taxes of U.S. citizens  in advance,  people can use or create the software  in the way they
want. The main matters  to comply  with are as follows.
+ When distributing  the software,  copyright  notice and absence  of warranty  should be specified.
+ The source code can be used for commercial  software  without  limitations  because  there is no obligation  to
disclose  the source code of the modified  program.
© Apache  license
The Apache  license is applicable  to all software  of the Apache  Software  Foundation  (ASF), including  the Apache
web server. Like the BSD license, it does not require disclosure  of the source code. The main matters  to comply
with are as follows.
- The trademark  right for the name “Apache”  should not be violated.
+ When distributing  the software,  copyright  notice and absence  of warranty  should be specified.
+ The code distributed  under the Apache  license can be combined  with the code distributed  under the GPL 3.0.
+ The source code can be used for commercial  software  without  limitations
because  there is no obligation  to disclose  the source code of the modified  program.
