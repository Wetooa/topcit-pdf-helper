01 Network  Layer Overview  and Equipment
A) What is a network  layer?
The network  layer is the third layer of the OSI 7 model and TCP/IP and sends packets,  from a transmitting  side, to a
receiving  side. It receives  a segment  from the transmitting  layer, encapsulates  it, and sends it to the datalink  layer.

B) Network  layer function
The transmitting  side of the network  layer performs  payload  encapsulation,  and the receiving  side performs  payload
decapsulation.  The packetizing  function  is responsible  for ensuring  that there is no change  to the payload  during data
transmission.  The routing function  finds a path through  which packets can be delivered.  The forwarding  function is
performed  by a router when a packet arrives through  one interface  on the router. When performing  forwarding,  the
router creates  a decision  table by applying  the routing  rules. The decision  table is also called the forwarding  or routing
table.
<Table 37) Network  Layer Functions
Function Description
- The transmitting  side encapsulates  the payload,  and the receiving  side decapsulates  the payload.
Packetizing - The function  is responsible  for transmitting  a payload,  from the transmitting  side, to the receiving  side,
without  a change.
Routing - The function  finds the path to transfer  the payload,  from the transmitting  side, to the receiving  side.
- The router performs  the function  when a packet has arrived  through  an interface.
Forwarding - The router applies the routing  rules to create a decision  table.
3 The decision  table is also called the routing  table.
C) Internetworking  equipment
Internetworking  refers to a connection  between  networks.  The leading  internetworking  equipment  includes  repeaters,
bridges,  switches,  and routers. .
