B) Classification  according  to the cloud operation  form
Cloud services  can be classified  into three levels, based on the service  operation  form. The following  table shows the
classification,
{Table 29) Cloud Service  Type Based on Disclosure  Level
Cloud service Description
; + Cloud services  disclosed  to unspecified  masses  over the Internet  and are accessible  by thePublic cloud
Internet
: + Cloud services  implemented  over the closed network  by enterprises  and institutions  to allowPrivate  cloudaccess  only to authorized  users
+ Services  that use both cloud services  open to the outside  and closed cloud services,  by
p combining the public cloud and private cloudHybrid cloud g tne Pi Pp
+ The compatibility  by moving  services  deployed  in the public cloud to the private  cloud domain
and sending  services  in the private  cloud domain  to the public is very important.
03 Server  Virtualization  Technology
The conventional  computing  environment  generally  installs an OS-dependent  on single hardware  and runs
applications  above the OS. Virtualization  refers to the technology  of abstracting  the computer  resources  of multiple
computers  to make them look like servers, or by abstracting  the computer  resources  of a computer  to make them
look like multiple  computers.  Since the server  virtualization  technology  makes it possible  to run one or more operating
systems  on a computer,  it can maximize  the utilization  rate of computer  resources  and management  efficiency.
Cloud services  generally  use virtualization  technology  to provide abstract  computer  resources  to users. The x86
virtualization  technology,  in particular,  has been rapidly spread, based on the technology  and market  maturity,  and has
become  the basis of the cloud computing  environment  for the logic sharing and allocation  of computing  resources
beyond  the physical  limitations.
A) Hypervisor
In server  virtualization,  a host OS is a physical  server, and a guest OS is a virtually  provided  server. Server  virtualization
technology  can be classified,  according  to how a virtual server allocates physical  resources in order to make it look
like a physical server. A hypervisor  is a technology  of virtualizing  a physical server. It is a logical platform  for server
virtualization.  It is also called a virtual machine  monitor  (VMM). The hypervisor  can be classified  by how it is installed
and virtualized.
B) Hypervisor  types
Hyperviors  are classified  into native types and hosted types, according  to the installation  method.  The native type
is installed  directly on the hardware,  while the hosted type (see [Figure 95]) is installed  on an OS, like conventional
programs.
