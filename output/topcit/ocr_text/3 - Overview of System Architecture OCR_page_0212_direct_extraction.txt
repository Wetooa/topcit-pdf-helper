Overview  of System Architecture )
# Practical  preview
Network  technologies  are changing  with new technologies,  such as loT, artificial intelligence  (Al), and cloud
computing.  The recent  topic of the new network  technology  is the software-defined network  (SDN). SDN
is a technology  for standardizing  software  that is dependent  on existing  hardware  manufacturers  and
providing  flexible network  services.  It is the core technology  of a software-defined  data center (SDDC).
Cloud computing  is another  core technology  of SDDC. As such, the network  is the infrastructure  and core
of new technologies.  Even in Al, the network  performance  determines  the Al performance.  Therefore,  the
A\ network  uses InfiniBand,  which is a short word for infinite bandwidth.  The existing  network  Ethemet  can
communicate  with one device at a time, but InfiniBand  can simultaneously  handle communication  between
multiple  devices. It can reliably  operate,  even if there is a problem  with some equipment.  This section
discusses  new network  technologies  that have recently  become  a hot topic.
