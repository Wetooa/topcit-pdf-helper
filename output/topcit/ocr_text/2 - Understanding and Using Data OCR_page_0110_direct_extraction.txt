C) Advanced  DML join operations
@ NL (Nested  Loop) Join
NL Join  performs  join operations  in a similar way to the nested loop statement  used in programming.  The table
outside  the loop is called the “preceding  table” or the “outer  table”, and the table inside the loop is called the “following
table’ or the ‘inner table”.
NL Join first extracts the rows that meet the conditions  of the preceding  table and performs  a join operation
while reading  the following  table. This operation is repeated  as many times as the number  of rows that meets the
conditions  of the preceding  table. As the join operation  of the following  table is repeated  as many times as the
number  of rows that meet the conditions  of the preceding  table, it is recommended  to select a table with fewer
result rows as the preceding  table in consideration  of performance.  It is advantageous  to NL Join to have a narrow
processing  range because  data are accessed  randomly.
@ Sort Merge  Join
Sort Merge Join performs  a join operation  by sorting  data based on the join column. Sort Merge Join is advantageous
when processing  a wide range of data as it mainly reads data using the scan method,  unlike NL Join. However,
