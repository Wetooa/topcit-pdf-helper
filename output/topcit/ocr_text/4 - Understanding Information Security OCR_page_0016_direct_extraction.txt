against  computers,  file systems,  or networks.  Malware  can be classified  into the following  types:
@ Worms
Malware  that runs independently.  This malware  replicates  itself and spreads  to other computers.
@ Viruses
Viruses refer to malicious codes that are inserted into the code of another  independent  program,  then make
the program  perform  malicious  behavior  and spread on its own.
© Trojan horse
A program  with hidden codes. Although  it looks like a normal program,  malicious  code is executed  when the
user executes  the program.
G) Major security  solutions
® Firewall
A firewall  refers to a security  solution  installed  between  the public network  and the private network  to protect
the private network  from the outside. In general, there are two types of firewalls.  The first type is a packet
filtering  gateway,  which determines  whether  to pass the packet, based on a series  of rules. The second type is
a proxy server that provides  authentication  to specific hosts to access a private network  and allows them to
pass the packet. However,  a method  with increased  security  is also used, which combines  these two methods.
@ Intrusion  Prevention  System (IPS)
A security  system  that blocks intrusions  in real time by detecting  unauthorized  and abnormal  behaviors  for the
target system (network  detection  area), and by distinguishing  detected  illegal behavior.  It can be assumed  that
the characteristics  in the common  area between  the average  area of the behavior  of the intruder,  and that
of the behavior  of the authorizer,  make intrusion  detection  difficult.  The intrusion  detection  system is built
first, along with a firewall,  when implementing  a general security  system.  The purpose  of building  the intrusion
detection  system includes real-time  detection  and blocking  of illegal activities,  such as hacking,  and defense
against  attacks  performed  by using the packet,  allowed  by the firewall.
© Virtual Private Network  (VPN)
A technology  that enables  to safely use access control, authentication,  and confidentiality  services,  like a
private  network  when using a public network,  without  building  a physical  private  network  between  remote sites.
IPSec and SSL are the representative  technologies  for implementing  a VPN. The VPN can be implemented  in a
dedicated  system,  router, or firewall.
@ Single Sign On (SSO)
Single sign on enables the user to access another  site without a separate  authentication  procedure  after
logging in on one site. In general, different  systems  and sites manage  their user information  separately.
However, it is necessary  to link user information  on occasion.  In this case, SSO can be used for the integrated
