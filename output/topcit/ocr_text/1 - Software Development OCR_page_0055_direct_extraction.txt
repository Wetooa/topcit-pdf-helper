01 Principles  of Software  Design
The complexity  of the problem area should be reduced by continuously  dividing  the user requirements
in the software  design phase, and its results should be reassembled  as proper  groups by considering  the
independence  and dependence  of the role unit. This task is also expressed  as the basic design principle  of “Divide
and Conquer”.  Complex  problems  can be solved more easily if we mentally  divide a system into separate
pieces, Also, if the functions  are divided, or the user interface  is logically  divided, an easier solution can be
found.
In general, a system component  divided at a higher level is called a subsystem.  The subsystem is a program
component  that can perform  functions  and be compiled  independently.  The subsystem  means that a system
has been divided at a higher level of the system structure.  System designers  divide a problem  into subsystems
so that several designers  and designers  can develop  different  subsystems  independently  later on. The clarity
of the split process is pursued  to make the entire system work smoothly,  and to facilitate  the integration  of
subsystems  developed  by different  developers  at a later date.
A) Abstraction
Abstraction  means considering  product  implementation  at a higher level first, rather than concerning  oneself
with implementation  at a detailed  level, in order to access a problem  area gradually  while maintaining  a larger
flow. Abstraction  enables  us to express  only essential  matters  that are easy to handle, because  abstraction
eliminates  details that are of no interest  to us or are not essential.  Abstraction  is an important  principle
that is applied throughout  the entire engineering  process.  Engineering  is a process  of moving from a higher
abstraction  level to a low level. The types of abstraction  can be divided into data abstraction,  control
abstraction,  and process  abstraction.
We need to understand  how components  (or modules)  interact  with each other and the behavior  that
manifests  itself outside  when a system is divided, before understanding  how the components  are implemented
inside in detail. That is, the concept  of abstraction  is based on focusing  on the external  interface  by daring to
omit methods  of component  implementation.
B) Information  hiding
Information  hiding is based on the concept  that the content  of each module is hidden, and that messages
can be transmitted  by the interface  only. It is designed  in such a way that one module or subsystem  does
not affect other modules,  by limiting  access to internal information.  For example,  when a change  occurs in
the design process,  information  hiding ensures  that the change  affects the minimum  number  of modules  only.
That is, if a module is defined by an interface  with the outside,  and detailed  information  including  the internal
structure  or progress  of the module  is hidden from other modules,  the information  is hidden. Information  hiding
keeps the modules  independent  of each other.
Information  hiding does not necessarily require a programming  language equipped  with an information  hiding
mechanism.  Rather, it is a basic principle  for designing  software,  and the concept  of information  hiding is
important  in system design in that it keeps the components  independent  of each other. Information  hiding
hides the internal  structure  of each module  (abstraction),  and the modules  communicate  with each other using
the predefined  interface  only, without  needing  to know the internal  structure.  If a module  needs to be modified,
