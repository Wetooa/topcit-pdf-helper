authentication  of multiple  systems,  based on the information  of one user.
@® Web Application  Firewall (WAF)
Located  in front of  the web server, this security  solution monitors  incoming  traffic with the HTTP/HTTPS
protocol and blocks malicious  attacks  detected  against  the web application,  such as the SQL Injection  attack
or XSS attack, before it reaches  the web server.
© Network  Access  Control (NAC)
When at the endpoint,  when a user computer  attempts  to access the internal network  for the first time, the
system checks whether  the accessing  user computer  complies  with various  security  policies,  such as network
user authentication,  anti-virus  program installation,  etc., and controls  network  access according  to the pre-
defined  security  policy, when security  policies  are not observed.
@ Wireless  Intrusion  Prevention  System (WIPS)
The WIPS automatically  detects and blocks access from unauthorized  wireless  devices by continuously
monitoring  the wireless  LAN operated  of a specific  organization,  and it improves  the stability  of wireless  LAN
and enables integrated  management.  The WIPS provides  a function  of detecting  and blocking  an intrusion
attempt  using an unauthorized  AP or user device in the exposed  wireless  network.
Enterprise  Security  Management  (ESM)
ESM is designed  to provide a consistent  and intuitive  administrator  and user interface  by integrating  security
management  functions  modularized  by function  and product.  This security  solution  aims to build an integrated
security  management  system for all systems,  according  to standard  policies, by building  an efficient,  policy-
oriented,  and systematic  security  management  system.
© Security  Information  Event Management  (SIEM)
The SIEM solution  establishes  an early warning and monitoring  system for intelligent  threats,  which provides
correlation  analysis and forensic  functions  in the vast information  of big data, by extending  the role of the
existing  ESM from the security  domain  to the entire enterprise,  and by adding corporate  compliance  response
functions,  so that those threats  can be traced later, instead  of only collecting  and analyzing  logs.

A) Blockchain
The Bitcoin cryptocurrency  system and all transactions  occurring  in the network  are recorded  in one public
ledger, distributed,  and stored in a single ledger. Blockchain  is a distributed  ledger and is designed  with a
structure  that enables network  participants  to store and verify data. When transactions  occur, transactions
that have occurred  for a certain period of  time (10 minutes)  are collected  to create a block, in order to verify
transaction  information,  then the blocks are sequentially  connected  to form a chain. That’s why it is called a
