The structure  of a system  should be set in such a way that the user’s requirements  can be satisfied  in the early
stages of design. It is desirable  to divide the system in order to solve complex  problems.  A complex  problem
can be solved easily if the system is analyzed  after dividing  it. An easier solution  can be found if functions  are
divided or the user interface  is divided logically.
System components  split from the top level are generally  called subsystems.  Subsystems  are the program
components  that generally  include data and the control structure,  and can perform functions  independently
and can be compiled.  In addition,  subsystems  are distinguished  by the service  or function  they provide.
A framework  is a support unit that collects  knowledge,  which can be reflected  in architectural  design
repetitively,  when designing  a subsystem.  The framework  represents  a general structure  that can be
extended  to create a concrete  subsystem,  and increases  the level of design abstraction  by providing  concrete
implementation  methods.
Architecture  design is a process  of setting  up a system configuration  to satisfy the system requirements.  The
relationship  between  each component  (module)  in the program  structure  can be described  using the results
of the requirements  analysis process.  The main purpose  of structure  design is to develop  a modular  program
structure,  and to represent  the control and interface  between  the modules.
02 Software  Architecture  Style
The following  section  describes  the representative  types of architecture  found during software  development.
A) Repository  structure
When one subsystem creates data and other subsystems  use that data, the repository  is a structure  that
enables  all subsystems  to share the data by storing  all shareable  data in one place. The structure  of the shared
repository  is suitable  for sharing  a large amount  of data.
B) MVC (Model - View - Controller)  structure
The MVC structure  is a framework  that is frequently  used for GUI design. It is an approach  in which several
expressions  of one object can interact with each other. Therefore,  when the expression  of one object is
modified,  all other expressions  are updated  accordingly.  Modifications  can be simplified,  and reuse can be made
easy using this method.
C) Client-server  model
The client-server  model is composed  of a set of servers and clients. The model is composed  of a client
requesting  a service and a server providing  the service, and there may be multiple  client instances.  Generally,
the client-server model can utilize the network  system effectively  as it is implemented as a client-server
model.
