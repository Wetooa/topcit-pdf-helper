01 Concept  and Tupes of Software  Maintenance
A) Definition  of software  maintenance
Software  maintenance  is the last phase of the SDLC (Software  Development  Life Cycle). It is an operation-
oriented  operational  phase that extends  the life of software,  and comprises  a series of tasks aimed at
correcting  software  errors and improving  its functions  and performance  by modifying  the original requirements.
Software  maintenance  is a series of software  engineering  works that eliminate  defects,  improve  performance,
and adapt software  to the changed  environment  after its initial delivery  to the customer.
B) Purposes  of software  maintenance
Software  is mainly maintained  to improve software  performance,  repair defects,  port software  to enable it to
run in a new environment,  and consists  of a series of preventive  measures  including  correction.  As mentioned
above, software  maintenance  is a very important  phase in securing  the efficiency  of the software  life cycle for
the following  reasons.
+ Noticeable  increase  of maintenance  costs that are higher than the  existing  development  costs among the
entire software  development  and maintenance  costs.
+ Increased  administrative  tasks such as documentation  due to the complexity  of the software.
+ Emphasis  is placed on the importance  of management  due to the use period being longer than the
development  period.
+ Increased  maintenance  works due to the spread of package  development,  rather than outsourced
development.
C) Type of software  maintenance
Software  maintenance  can be classified  according  to reason, time, and target. Sometimes,  a contract  is signed
according  to these classification  criteria.
