A network  layer is the most closely related to data transmission,  among the network  standard  layers
and plays an important  role in efficient  data transmission.  Through  this chapter,  you will understand  how
IP-based  packets  are generated,  how they are efficiently  transmitted  in the Internet  network,  and how
to move and process  data over the network.  This chapter  describes  the router's basic structure,  which
is a device of the network  layer, the principle  of packet routing, the routing algorithm,  and the actual
implemented  routing  protocol.
>>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain  the protocol  concept  and equipment  of the network  layer.
2. To be able to explain the routing protocol  concept,  types, and algorithms,
3. To be able to understand  the IPv4 address  specification  system and subnetting.
