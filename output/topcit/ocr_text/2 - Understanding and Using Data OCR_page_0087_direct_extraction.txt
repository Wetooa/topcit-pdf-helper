01 Relational  Table Conversion  and Table design
Like logical modeling,  the academic  world and the industrial  world have a quite different  understanding  of the scope
of physical  modeling.  In particular,  the process  of creating  a table structure  diagram  corresponding  to the ERD, that
is, the process  of relational  table conversion,  is quite different. The academic  world understands  this phase as logical
modeling, whereas  industry  understands  this process  as physical modeling.  It is recommended  to understand  this
difference  and check the things to be done in each phase according  to the two perspectives.
A) Differences  between  the academic  world’s  and industry's  understanding  of physical  modeling
@ Understanding  of the academic  world
+ Physical  modeling  refers to the process  of implementing  a table structure  diagram,  which is an output of logical
modeling,  according  to an actual DBMS.
+ Major tasks of physical  modeling:  Data type definition, index design, etc.
+ Normalization  and denormalization,  which handle table structures,  are performed in the logical modeling  phase.
However,  denormalization  is performed  in logical modeling  due to the requirements  of physical  modeling,  because
denormalization  is performed  in consideration  of performance.
@ Understanding  of industry
+ Physical modeling  refers to the process  of converting  the ERD, which is an output of logical modeling,  into a table
structure  drawing.
+ The major tasks of physical modeling  are more diverse than those of the academic  world, including  table and
column definition,  primary  key and foreign key definition,  normalization  and denormalization,  data type definition,
index design,  view design, and distributed  design.
B) Relational  table conversion
@ Entity type conversion
+ the relation R is created that corresponds  to each entity type E and all general attributes  of E are included  as the
columns  of R.
+ Each sub-component  is included  only for the composite  attribute.
+ After selecting  one of the key attributes  of E, it is selected  as the primary  key of R.
@ Conversion  of the weak entity
+ The relation R is created  that corresponds  to each weak entity type W, and including  all general attributes  of W as
the columns  of R.
+ The primary  key of E is included  as the foreign  key of R, regarding  the identifying  entity type E of W
+ The primary  key of R is composed  with a combination  of the primary  key of E and the partial key of W.
© Conversion  of the 1:1 relationship
+ It is assumed  that S and T are two entity types participating  in the relationship.
+ The primary  key of T is included  as the foreign key of S.
