In March 2018, a group of people who leaked the design drawings  of a domestic  front-load  washing
machine  motor to China was caught  by the police. It turned out that they handed  over the motor drawings
for the front-load  washing  machine  developed  by a domestic  company  through  tens of billions of won in
investment  over 10 years, in return for KRW 60 million in cash, housing,  and vehicles.
According  to the Gyeongnam  Provincial  Police Agency's  International  Crime Investigation  Unit, two people
were arrested  on charges  of violating  the law on the prevention  of unfair competition  and protection  of
trade secrets,  and three other people  who assisted  them with the leakage  were arrested.
Among  them, Mr. A, is alleged to have moved to a Chinese  company  with  a laptop in which the design
drawings  and key technical  data related to manufacturing  of the entire product  line are stored, while
serving as the research head of a Chinese local subsidiary  of a medium-sized  company  in Gwangju  that
manufactures  and produces  high-efficiency  motors for front-load  washing  machines  in January  2015.
Moreover,  Mr. B, who served as a researcher  in the production  technology  department  of the same
company,  secretly  took away 5918 related files such as design drawings  and inspection  data for production
facilities  when he resigned in February  2015. In addition,  three other people who worked for the same
company  are also suspected  of stealing  design drawings  of production  facilities  and transferring  them to Mr.
AandB.
In response,  Tae-hee  Lee, Sergeant  of the GimhaeJungbu  Police Station’s investigation  department,  said,
‘While technology  and systems  have been highly developed  and improved  over time, there are still some
things that remain outdated.  It is professional  ethics,” explaining  that the fundamental  cause of safety
accidents  is, in the end, an individual  without  a proper  sense of professional  ethics.
