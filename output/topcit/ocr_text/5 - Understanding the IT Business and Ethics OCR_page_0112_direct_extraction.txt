The IT business  performance  evaluation  is a procedure  for reviewing  how IT has contributed  to the growth
of an enterprise.  In the past, IT business  performance  evaluations  were mainly performed  on the financial
aspects  of a business.  This made it easy to quantify  the results of IT's contribution to  the earnings  of an
enterprise  and its affiliated  organizations.  However,  this type of evaluation  failed to cover all aspects  of how
IT business  could contribute  in the aforementioned  regard.
In recent years, enterprises  have been expanding  the scope of their IT business  performance  evaluations
with the aim of creating  a more comprehensive  evaluation.  Current  evaluations  cover not only financial
aspects,  but also non-financial  areas such as efforts to enhance  the corporate  image or raise employees’
morale  or satisfaction  with their work.
When evaluating  the performance  of IT business,  one particularly  important  consideration  is the degree to
which enterprises  can align individual  performance  goals with the enterprise’s  performance  goals. To this
end, communication  among employees  is of paramount  importance,  and enterprises  must utilize various
techniques  for bringing  into alignment  top-down  goal setting and bottom-up  goal setting  when they
operate  their businesses
