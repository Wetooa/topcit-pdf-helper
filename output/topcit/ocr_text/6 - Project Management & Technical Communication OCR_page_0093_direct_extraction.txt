01 Concept  and Process  of Schedule  Management
A) Concept  of schedule  management
@ Schedule
A schedule  is a display of the start and finish dates of each of the activities  that make up the project  and can
be expressed  in various  formats  such as tables, graphs,  and network  diagrams.
However,  the date information  displayed  in the schedule  is determined  based on a comprehensive  analysis  of
the duration,  sequential  relationships,  human and physical resources  required  of the activities,  input costs, the
uncertainty  of the project progress,  and the working  conditions.  It is distinct  from the timetable  for a simple
goal.
@ Importance  of Schedule
The schedule  is distinguished  from the timetable  as it describes  in a logical manner  the factors  that affect the
overall project  execution  time and cost, such as the dependency  between  activities  and the type and quantity
of resources  required  for each activity,  in addition  to the arbitrary  relationship  between  work and time. Writing
a schedule  is important  as it functions  as follows:
+ Useful planning:  you can set a feasible  timeline  by reasonably  estimating  the duration  of the project.
+A bird's eye view of the project: you can get a full understanding  of what the project is and how it is
executed.  In addition,  the completed  schedule  is a good tool to explain the project team's plans to
stakeholders  such as clients and the management.
+ Effective  control: resources can be concentrated  by identifying  areas that need intensive  management
through  schedule  analysis.
+ Effective  communication:  the schedule  itself expresses  a lot of information  about the project. Thus, a well-
written  schedule  allows for effective  communication.
® Format  of Schedule
Schedules  can take many formats.  The most common  schedule  formats  in project management  are as follows.
