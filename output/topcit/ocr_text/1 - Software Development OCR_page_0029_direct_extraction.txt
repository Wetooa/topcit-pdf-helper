C) Scrum
@ Scrum overview
Scrum is one of the agile methodologies  designed  for project management  and is a representative  type
of empirical  management  technique  based on estimation  and adjustment.  Scrum for software  was directly
modeled  after “The New Product  Development  Game’ by Hirotaka Takeuchi  and Ikujiro Nonaka  published  in the
Harvard Business  Review in 1986. This method was named “Scrum”  when it was introduced  by Ken Schwaber
and Jeff Sutherland  for software  development  in 1995. Scrum consists  of three fundamental  units, as shown in
<Table 3>.
<Table 3> Type of Scrum units
Roles Description
The product  owner manages  the creation  of a product  backlog  corresponding  to the product
function  list, priority  adjustment,  or new item addition.
It is recommended  that the product  owner  should play a key role when setting  up a splint plan, but
should be involved  in team operation  as little as possible  once the sprint starts.
The Scrum master  endeavors  to remove  any factors  that disturb  the team’s work. The Scrum
master  supports  the team responsible  for development  while upholding  the principles  and values.Product  owner
