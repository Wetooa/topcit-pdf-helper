Typically,  a separate  program must be installed  when a person wants to use a particular  service or program on a
smartphone  or PC. Kakao Talk is a leading messenger  program  that is widely used in South Korea and exists in
different  versions  for PC, Android  and iOS. As such, a separate  program  must be installed  for each type of OS in order
to use Kakao Talk. However,  if HTMLS is used, there is no need to install a separate  program,  and Kakao Talk can be
accessed  directly  through  the web browser.  Furthermore,  word processors  and games can be used without  having to
install with the help of HTML5.
The HTMLS standard  is a next-generation  HTML standard  that overcomes  the limitations  of previous  HTML
standards,  allowing  rich web applications  such as video, voice, and 2D graphics,  without  requiring  a separate  plug-in.
Plug-ins  and Active X control were very popular  as solutions  for overcoming  the limitations  of the previous  HTML:
However,  each came with its own set of problems,  which could only be overcome  through  functional  expansion  and
combination  through  the advanced  CSS3 and JavaScript  APIs.
HTML5  was designed  around the principles  of compatibility,  practicality,  interoperability,  and universal  access. The
contents  of the HTML standard  cover the document  structure,  markup standards,  and API standards.  When the
semantic  markup  part and the API part of the HTML5  standard  are examined  separately,  26 new markups  have been
added to the semantic  markup part to enable much clearer semantic  representation than conventional  HTML4.
HTMLS5 allows various services  or applications  based on web content,  such as search engines,  to provide improved
functionality,  In the case of APIs, new functions  such as web form, canvas,  and web socket  were added to support  the
development  of web-based  applications.  HTML5 uses much less JavaScript  code than HTML4  to support  the same
functionality,  making it easier to use in mobile environments  where network  speed is a sensitive  factor. Recently,  a
growing  number  of cases have arisen in which corporate  business  solutions  are transitioning  to an HTML5-based
environment  so as to maximize  scalability  and efficiency.
@ Responsive  web/Adaptive  web
With the growing  use of mobile devices such as tablet PCs and smartphones,  interest in the mobile web is also
increasing.  Users want to enjoy the same web contents  at the same level of quality, irrespective  of the type of mobile
device or PC being used. However,  it was not easy to provide  the same quality of service  for different  environments
resulting  from different  mobile phone specifications  and the restrictions  that come with different  mobile phone screen
sizes. It is also impossible  to develop  a web that is optimized  for all types of mobile devices. The responsive  web
emerged  as one approach  to solving  this conundrum.
The responsive  web is an approach  to web design that results in the most optimal user environment,  i.e. one that
meets the requirements  of many different  devices - from desktops  through monitors  to mobile phones. In other
words, it is a web whose size changes  to fit any device environment,  making  it easy for users to read the contents.
With the recent trend towards  carrying  mobile devices as the primary  or first device, the number  of mobile web
users has grown to exceed the number  of regular  Internet  web users. Web designers  have responded  by minimizing
