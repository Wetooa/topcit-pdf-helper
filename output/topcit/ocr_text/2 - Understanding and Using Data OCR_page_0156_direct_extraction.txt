* Preview  for practical  business Why Al must understand  both technology
and ethics
Although  interest in data analysis has increased,  the existing  system architecture  and DBMS face
limitations  in terms of processing  speed and performance  when an existing  analysis  system  processes  tens
of PBs of unstructured  data generated  by multimedia,  SNS, sensors,  loT, etc., due to the advancement  of IT
technologies.  As a result, solutions  are being developed  that are suitable  for analyzing  the large volume  of
unstructured  data (variety)  generated  at high speed (velocity).  Technologies  related to big data, which was
still in its infancy  only a few years ago, have developed  rapidly and are now being used directly in our real
life.
The Al field needs to learn the Asilomar  principles  which are created by considering  not only the
understanding  of a given technology  but also the potential  side effects  of applying  that technology.
