+ Preview  for practical  business Building  a secure network  using the
firewall and DMZ
Company  A is a small and medium-sized  company  that utilizes  a network  connected  to 90 computers.
Currently,  the company  has 126 public IP addresses  (211.82.50.0/25),  one router (211.82.50.126/25),
a switch, a database  server, and a web server, respectively.  In this situation,  assistant  manager,  Kim,
was instructed  to introduce  a firewall to configure  the external,  internal, and DMZ network,  in order
to increase  a network  security  level. Let’s learn how to build a secure network  under the following
conditions.
+ Set private IPs (192.168.1.0/24)  for 90 internal  PCs and the database  server.
+ Place the web server in the DMZ area, while keeping  the existing  address  (211.82.50.1/25).
+ Subnet  the external  network  and DMZ network  into two existing  IP bands (211.83.50.0/25).
+ Use only one router, one firewall,  and two switches.
