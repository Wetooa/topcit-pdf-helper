D) Logical thinking  technique
Unlike creative problem solving, it is often necessary  to classify problems  according  to their root cause and
solve problems  based on facts. In other words,  a logical thinking  technique  is needed to predict the future
through  the facts discovered  up to now and data based on objective  indicators.  Techniques  for clearly  defining
everyday  problems  found in job performance  and deriving  solutions  to address  them through a vertical pro-
cess are as follows.
@ MECE(Mutually  Exclusive  and Collectively  Exhaustive)
As implied from its term, MECE is to compose  any information  or message  in a state of “without  duplication
and no omission  as a whole.” That is, in order to analyze  the problem,  each item is divided so that there are
no omissions  or duplicates,  and the total sum is processed  to include the number  of all cases. For example,  if
you group the whole of “time” into the past, present, and future, it can be said that the principle  of Mutually
(mutually)  / Exclusive  (without  redundancy),  Collectively  (as a whole) / Exhaustive  (without  omission)  is met.
However,  if the whole beverage  is divided into ionized beverages  and carbonated  beverages,  it satisfies  the
elements  of Mutually  (mutually)  / Exclusive  (without  duplication),  but because  other components  that can be
called beverages  such as mineral water are omitted,  the elements  of Collectively  (as a whole) / Exhaustive
cannot  be said to be fulfilled.

@ The Logic Tree
The Logic Tree is a breakdown  of key items in a tree form according  to the MECE principle,  and it can promote
logical thinking,  create a wide range of ideas, and ensure that there is no omission,  thereby  serving as a
checklist  for strategy  establishment  and problem-solving.
