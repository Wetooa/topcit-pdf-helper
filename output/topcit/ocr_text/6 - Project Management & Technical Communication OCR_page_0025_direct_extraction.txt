@ Step 1: Problem  Definition
In the problem definition  stage, you decide what problem you want to solve. It is necessary  to organize  the
problem  to grasp its essence,  and whether  the problem  can be fundamentally  resolved  by writing the problem
description.  For more accurate problem definition,  it is helpful to apply the MECE framework  to break the
problem  into subproblems,  rather  than defining  it as a single problem.
@ Step 2: Cause Analysis
In the stage of cause analysis,  a defined problem  is classified  according  to logical criteria and structured  step
by step. In order to analyze the cause of a structured  problem in detail, an issue tree is used to dissect  the
largest problem into smaller  components  in a logical order and organize  it in a tree form. From the bottom of
the organized  problem,  profiling  and various analysis  methods  are used to find the root cause of the problem.
In addition,  it is necessary  to prioritize  the finally identified  causes of the problem,  and remove  the ones that
are not essential  for fundamental  problem  solving.
© Step 3: Alternative  Development  and Evaluation
In the alternative  development  and evaluation  stage, various  alternatives  are developed  to address  the cause
of the problem  finally derived in the cause analysis  stage. Alternatives  developed  by establishing  various
hypotheses  from the root cause of the problem and comparing  with the facts found through profiling  are
evaluated  through  evaluation  criteria and weighting  for each criterion,  and one or more alternatives  are finally
selected.
@ Step 4: Solution  Application  and Feedback
In the solution  application  and feedback  stage, the final selected  alternative  is verified.  It is important  to find a
test bed to verify the established  alternative  the most efficiently,  and prepare  for its execution.  The alternative
is executed  based on a detailed  workplan  and quantitative  feedback  on its effectiveness  is provided,  to verify
the validity  of the alternative  and provide  feedback.
C) Creative  thinking  techniques
It is important  to clearly define everyday  problems  found in the course of job performance  and to derive solu-
tions or processes  to address  them through  various ideas. To this end, it is necessary  to consciously  guide
the flow of thinking  through  appropriate  techniques.  There are the following  ways of thinking  techniques  that
creatively  solve problems  through  this horizontal  process.
@ Brainstorming
In the 1940s, American  advertiser  Alex Osborn invented  brainstorming  as a kind of meeting  method  to come
up with ideas. The original meaning  of the term brainstorming  refers to the mental derangement  of a mentally
ill patient. In other words, abnormal  phenomena,  like a storm in the brain, are used as a way of thinking of
ideas at meetings.  It can be used in the entire process  of problem  solving, such as analyzing  the cause of the
problem,  deriving  a solution, developing  evaluation  criteria and establishing  an action plan.
