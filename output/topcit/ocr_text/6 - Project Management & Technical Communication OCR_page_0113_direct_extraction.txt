The following  graph is an example  of earned  value management.  As of August 1, the planned  value (PV), actual
cost (AC), and earned value (EV) are measured,  and schedule  variance  (SV) and cost variance  (CV) are ana-
lyzed, for  project  value estimation.  The AC, which is costs actually  incurred,  was spent more than the PV, and
the EV, which indicates  the actual amount  of work completed,  was less than the PV.
To analyze the project cost, schedule  variance  (SV) = earned value (EV) - planned value (PV) is negative,
meaning  behind schedule,  and cost difference  (CV) = earned value (EV) - actual cost (AC) is also negative,
meaning  over budget.

Estimate  At Completion  (EAC) is “estimated  total cost at project completion’.  An important  advantage  of
the EVM is that the total cost of the project can be estimated  reasonably.  EAC is calculated  as the sum of
the actual cost (AC) incurred  from work completed  up to the point of performance  measurement  and the
estimated  cost of the remaining  work, or Estimate  To Completion  (ETC). Since the actual cost (AC) can be
known as the result of the performance  measurement,  only the Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) is calculated  to
come up with the EAC.
There are three methods  to calculate  the ETC according  to the results of performance  analysis.
How to apply the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work divided by the cost performance  index (CPI)
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) = (Budget  at Completion  (BAC) - Earned Value (EV)) / Cost Performance  Index
(CPI)
How to apply the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work without  change
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC) = (Budget  at Completion  (BAC) - Earned Value (EV))
How to create a new budget  overriding  the previously  approved  budget  for the remaining  work
+ Estimate  to Complete  (ETC)= New estimate  for the remaining  work
By adding  the ETC calculated  as above with the AC, the EAC can be estimated  as follows:
+ Estimate  At Completion  (EAC) = Actual Cost (AC) + Estimate  to Complete  (ETC)
