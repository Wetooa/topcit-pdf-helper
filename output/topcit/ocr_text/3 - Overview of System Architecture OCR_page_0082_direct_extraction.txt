@ Pipeline  hazard
A pipeline hazard refers to the pipeline speed exceptionally  slowing  down. Pipeline  hazards  include the data hazard,
the control hazard, and the structural  hazard.
Data hazards  occur when the next instruction execution  has to be delayed until the previous  instruction  has been
completed  because  of the dependency  between  instruction  operands.  Control hazards  are generated  by branch
instructions,  like branch and jump,which  change the execution  order of the instructions.  Structural  hazards  are
generated  when instructions  cannot be processed  in parallel in the same clock cycle, due to hardware  limitations.  In
other words, it means the hardware  cannot  support  the combination  of instructions  in the same clock cycle.
E) Parallel  programming  technology
@® Compiler  technology  - OpenMP
OpenMP  is a compiler  directive-based  parallel programming  API. Here, directive-based  means processing  only the
desired parts in parallel, by adding a directive  to a program  written sequentially  without  parallel processing.  The
execution  model of OpenMP  is the fork/join  model. A program  initially operates  as a master thread, and when it
encounters  a directive,  it creates  threads  and independently  executes  them. When the parallel processing  is finished
(when the area selected  as a directive  is finished),  they are joined into one master  thread in order to run the code
sequentially.
@ Message  passing  parallel programming  model
The message  passing  interface  is a parallel programming  model suitable  to a distributed  memory  system structure.
Since MPI is not a memory  sharing mode, the nodes share the information  by transferring  messages  over the
network.  Therefore,  the network  communication  speed is the most important  factor  for performance,  and it is widely
used by supercomputers  that require  a high-speed  operation.  Parallel programming  tools for message  passing  include
High Performance  FORTRAN  (HPF), Parallel Virtual Machine  (PVM), and Message  Passing  Interface  (MPI). MPI has
become  the standard.
