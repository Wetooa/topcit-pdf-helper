04 Data Manipulation  Language  (DML)
A data manipulation  language  is used to input, modify, delete, and search data in a database.  This section  introduces
the data manipulation  language  by subdividing  it into basic operations,  aggregate  operations,  and advanced  join
operations.
A) Basic DML operations
DML basic operations  consist  of statements  such as INSERT, UPDATE,  DELETE,  SELECT,  FROM, and WHERE,  and are
used for input, modification,  deletion,  and search operations.  Among  them, FROM and WHERE  are used together  with
the INSERT, UPDATE,  DELETE,  and SELECT  statements.  FROM is used to designate  the target table and WHERE  is
used to set the conditions.
<Table  43> Basic DML operations
Statement Description  and examples  of usage
Used to search  data values stored in a table.
SELECT SELECT  column  name 1, column  name 2
FROM table name
WHERE  conditional  clause:
Used to input values in all or some columns  of a table
(Entering  all columns)
INSERT  INTO table name VALUES  (input value 1, input value 2, input value 3);
(Entering  some columns)
INSERT INSERT  INTO table name (column  name 1, column name 3) VALUES  (input value 1, input value 3);
(Entering  from an existing  table)
INSERT  INTO table name
SELECT  column  name 1, column  name 2
FROM table name
WHERE  conditional  clause:
Used to change  the data stored in a table.
UPDATE  is performed  for all rows if a conditional  clause is not specified.UPDATE - :UPDATE  table name SET column  name 1 = input value 1, column  name 2 = input value 2
WHERE  conditional  clause:
Used to delete  the data stored in a table.
DELETE DELETE  is performed  for all rows if a conditional  clause is not specified.
DELETE  FROM table name
WHERE  conditional  clause:
B) Aggregate  DML operations
Aggregate  operations  can be performed  by using the AVE, SUM, and COUNT  statements  of the DML. The GROUP
BY clause is specified  after the FROM clause and the WHERE clause in the SQL statement.  This clause is used to
group data and to obtain statistical  information  on each group item. Aggregate  operations  are generally  used with
the GROUP BY clause. However,  if an entire table is a group, an aggregate  operation  can be performed  without  the
GROUP  BY clause. On the other hand, the HAVING  clause can be used to set the condition  for the GROUP  BY clause.
In addition,  the DISTINCT  option can be used to consider  the same value as the same data.
