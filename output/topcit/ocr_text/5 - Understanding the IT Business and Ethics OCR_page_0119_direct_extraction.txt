C) Precautions  to take when deriving  KPI
@ KPls need the strategic  support  of top management
KPls should be kept separate  from legacy processes  and instituted  as an internal  process  that could lead to the best
performance  from the organization  as a whole. The task of managing  the KPls should not be delegated  to a task
force composed  of middle-level  managers:  rather, it should be the responsibility  of the top management,  who must
make sure the strategic  vision of the organization,  is reflected  in the KPIs.
@ Use a reference  model but do not imitate it!
Even a set of KPls from a great company  is of no use to another  enterprise  because  the goals and strategies  are
different  for each enterprise.  Therefore,  an enterprise  must develop  its own KPI which matches  its strategies.
@® KPI derivation  is a process  of making  continuous  improvements.
Starting  with a balanced  set of KPls, the KPIs should be derived in gradual steps so as to allow them to evolve into
a mature set of KPIs. It must be possible  to modify  a set of KPIs in order to allow enterprises  to respond  promptly  to
changes  in the business  environment.
