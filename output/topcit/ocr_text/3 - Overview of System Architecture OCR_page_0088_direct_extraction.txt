@ Internet  SCSI (iSCSI)
iSCSI encapsulates  SCSI commands  into IP packets  and transfer  the I/O block data through  TCP/IP. Technologies  like
IPSec ensure reliability.  It reduces  the network  storage implementation  cost, since it can use the existing  network
environment  as is.

@ Thin provisioning
The existing  fixed-allocation  storage  technology  uses a thick logical unit number  (LUN) wasted data storage  space.
Thin provisioning  is a storage  virtualization  technology  that allocates  data by mapping  actual data space into a thin
LUN. It can flexibly  expand  the disk space required  by users in cloud computing,  and it offers a higher  data utilization
rate than the conventional  thick LUN type.
