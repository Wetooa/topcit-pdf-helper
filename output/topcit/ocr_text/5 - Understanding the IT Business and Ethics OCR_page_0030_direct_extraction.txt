In the mid-1990s,  Dell Computers  of the U.S. conducted  a SWOT analysis  with a view to establishing  an
effective  business  strategy  that would make them highly competitive  in the value chain of the computer
industry.  Dell discovered  that its strengths  lay in selling directly  to customers  and in designing  its own
computers  and components  in order to lower its manufacturing  costs. It also recognized  that its principal
weakness  was its lack of relationships  with local computer  dealerships.  At that time, Dell Computers
was faced with threats  from rivals such as Compaq  and IBM, both of which enjoyed  much stronger  brand
recognition  and an outstanding  reputation  for quality. The company  took note of the fact that customers
already  had a deep knowledge  of computers  and knew exactly what they wanted in a computer  without
having  to talk to a sales representative.  The company  sensed an opportunity.  It also saw the Internet  as a
potential  marketing  tool. The results of Dell’s SWOT analysis  are described  below.
+ Ability  to sell directly  to consumers.
Sores) + Ability to keep prices lower than competitors.
Weakness(W) + No relationships  with local computer  dealerships.
+ Consumer  demand  for one-stop  shopping.
Opportunity(O) + Consumers  know exactly  what they want in a product.
+ Internet  could become  a powerful  marketing  tool.
Threat  (T) + Competitors  enjoy superior  brand power  to Dell.
+ Competitors  enjoy very close relationships  with local computer  dealerships.
After completing  the SWOT analysis,  DELL incorporated  elements  of the SWOT findings  into its IT
business  strategy.  The company  began assembling  and selling customer-tailored  computers  after
receiving  customer  orders over the phonewhich  ultimately  resulted in the entire process  taking
place on the Internet. Dell formulated  a strategy  that played to its strengths  while eliminating  its
dependence  on a local computer  network,  which was its weakest  link. The threats of better brand
recognition  and quality posed by Compaq  and IBM were effectively  neutralized  by Dells ability to
build high-quality  computers  tailored  to each customer's  individual  needs and then assemble  and ship
them immediately  to the customers.
