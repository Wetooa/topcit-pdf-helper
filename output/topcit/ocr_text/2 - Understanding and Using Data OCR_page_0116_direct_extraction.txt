03 Dynamic  SQL
Unlike static SQL statements,  dynamic  SQL statements  are dynamically processed  according  to program  logic. As
dynamic  SQL and static SQL are in a trade-off  relationship  in terms of performance  and flexibility,  an appropriate
method  should be selected  according  to the development  environment  and purpose.
A) Comparison  between  dynamic  and static SQL
<Table  45> Comparison  of the characteristics  of dynamic  SQL and static SQL
Item Static SQL Dynamic  SQL
OverviewAn SQL statement  is not assigned  to a variable  but
is mixed in the code for description.
An SQL statement  is processed  statically  by
declaring  CURSOR.An SQL statement  is assigned  to a string-type
variable  and processed  dynamically.
The SQL statement  can be dynamically  changed
according  to the condition.  Part or all of the SQL
statement  can be received  from the user at runtime.
Development
patternStatic SQL is declared  in the CURSOR  clause and
then the data is processed  in a looping  structure
between  the BEGIN and END clause.NVL (0) processing  is not needed  as the syntax  of
dynamic  SQL can be changed.
Column
compositionThe column  and WHERE  clause cannot  be changedAs a DBMS is called after assigning  an SQL
statement  in a variable,  all SQL statements  such as
variables  and columns  can be freely processed  with
logic.
Execution
planThe optimizer  sets up an execution  plan for Is NULL
and IS NOT NULL to process  the condition  wherein
NVL () is processed.
That is, if there are 6 conditions,  the execution
plan is divided  by 12 CONCATENATION.  As a result,
along hard parsing  time is required  to set up an
execution  plan.The optimizer  sets up an execution  plan for pure
access  paths only because  the execution  plan does
not have to be divided,  since there is no WHERE
condition  whereby  NVL() is processed.
Therefore,  the hard parsing  time can be minimized.
StrengthsThe execution  speed is faster  than dynamic  SQL.
SQL statements  can be checked  in advance  during
development.
Code readability  is high because  the code is more
intuitive  than dynamic  SQL.Anaccess  plan for each SQL statement  in the
application  is available  based on the most recent
statistical information.
More diverse  and flexible  applications  can be
developed  because  the SQL statement  is
determined  at runtime,  not during development.
ShortcomingsThe SQL statements  should all be defined  during
development.
The pre-compilation  and bind processes  are
required.The processing  speed is slower  than that of static
SQL.
The type, syntax, and privilege  of the SQL
statement  cannot  be checked  before execution.
The level of development  difficulty  is high, and
development  takes a remarkably  long time.
