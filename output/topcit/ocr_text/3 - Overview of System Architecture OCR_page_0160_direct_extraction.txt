<Table 38) Internetworking  Equipment
Equipment Description
Repeater A device that enhances  (amplifies  or reproduces)  the signals between  AN connection  points
Bridge A device that connects  two LANs and makes them look like one, through interpretation  and format conversion
Switch A device that has the concept  of a multi-port  bridge to separate  the network,  based on the MAC address
Router A device that finds the optimal  communication  path when connecting  to a heterogeneous  network
This section describes  for which of the OS! 7 layers and TCP/IP 4 layers these internetworking  devices are
responsible.  The router performs  packet routing  through  the IP address  on the network  layer. The bridge and switch
are responsible  for frame transfer  on the datalink layer, while the hub and repeater  transfer  physical signals on the
physical  layer. <Table 39> compares  the function  of each device  with the protocol  layer.

D) What is a router?
A router forwards  traffic and determines  the optimal path, using one or more metrics. In other words, it forwards:
packets  from one network,  to another,  based on the network  layer information.
@ Router  structure
As shown in [Figure 114], a router mostly  consists  of a router control plane and a forwarding  plane. The control plane,
implemented  in the software  in a router, determines  where to send the packets  it receives  and uses tables to decide.
The forwarding  plane actually  sends the packets  according  to the requirements  created  by the control  plane.
