are equipped  with GPS or video devices,  drones  can be used in many applications.

deepest  parts of the oceans. They can approach  places that are too hazardous  for humans  to go, such as places
where hazardous  gases or radioactivity  may be present.
Drones  can also be operated  in autonomous  mode without  a human operator,  in which it can recognize  its surrounding
environment  and fly by itself, Because  there are no restrictions  to where drones can go, they can be used in various
sectors.
