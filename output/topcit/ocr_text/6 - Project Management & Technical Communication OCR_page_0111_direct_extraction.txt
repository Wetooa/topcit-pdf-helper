The Intermediate,  and Detailed  COCOMO  models  are calculated  by changing  the coefficient  values in the table
above.
D) COCOMO  2(Constructive  Cost Model 2)
COCOMO  2 is a method  of estimating  software  development  costs by improving  the existing  COCOMO  model
through  such as code reusability,  off-the-shelf  component,  design and development  management,  etc. in ac-
cordance  with the changing  development  environment.
COCOMO  2 has three sub-models:  Application  Composition  Model, Early Design Model, and Post-Architecture
Model.
<Table 49> Sub-Models  of COCOMO  2
Type Explanation
+ Applied  to projects  using GUI Tool and CASE Tool for S/W prototyping
BOC ton Compe  ton MO! + Use component  count, complexity,  object points, etc
+ Applied  to estimate  approximate  cost and schedule  at the design stage
Early Design Model + Used when there is insufficient  information  on details  of scale, environment,
manpower,  and process  in the early stages of development
+ Applied  to projects  in which sufficient  data have been prepared  after architecture
establishment
+ Use unadjusted  function  points and SLOC (Source  Line Of Code) after the
establishment  of the software  life cyclePost-Architecture  Model
04 Cost Management  Technique  - Earned  Value Management
A) Concept  of earned  value
“Value” means how much something  is “worth”.  In earned value management,  value means how much the work
done so far is worth, and the budget  allocated  becomes  the value of the work.
+ Value = Monetary  value of work = Budgeted  Cost of Work Performed
“Earned  Value” means the value of the work actually  done at the point of measuring  performance.  Earned  val-
