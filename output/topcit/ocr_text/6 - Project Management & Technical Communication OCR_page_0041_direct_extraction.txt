D) Methods  of writing  e-mail
@® Importance  of E-mail
Email is one of the communication  techniques  that have been widely adopted  with the invention  of the Internet  and it
has become  the most popular  and frequently  used in recent  years. In particular,  in the field of software  development,  it is
a highly utilized means  of communication  and often serves as an official letter, so it must be written  clearly and carefully.
There are various techniques  for writing e-mails, but in general, the techniques  to refer to in business  settings  are as
follows.
+ Write a title in a way that the purpose  of writing  is clearly  revealed.
+ Write the content  in a way that the purpose  of writing  is effectively  revealed.
+ Designate  recipient/reference  person in consideration  of the scope of work.
+ Write the content  concisely  and clearly, and describe  the main content  first (the main clause followed  by the
subordinate  clause, deductive  writing)
@ Methods  of Writing  Effective  E-mail
+ Subject  line: Anyone  would be able to guess what the e-mail is about simply by reading  the subject  line. The
subject  of the email should be a itemized  sentence  that concisely  expresses  only the core of the email. It is
effective  to add a heading  such as [Report],  [Share],  [Notice], and [Reference]  in front of the title.
+ Greeting:  Must include a greeting  to induce mutually  positive  communication
+ Heading:  Place important  information  at the beginning  so that you can understand  it quickly. The structure
of the email is divided into 4 parts: greeting,  headings,  numbered  details, and final thank-you  message.  The
headings  serve to help you quickly understand  the contents  of the entire mail. Therefore,  it is better to
organize  the contents  of the mail in one sentence  so that the recipient  can quickly  understand  the contents.
+ Numbering:  The key tip for writing an email is to add numbers  such as 1, 2, and 3 to the email content  so
that you can understand  the email content  faster. It is important  to always number  the content  of the email.
The good thing about numbering  is that you can quickly understand  the contents  firstly, and secondly,  it is
convenient  because  you can send a reply to each numbered  item when the other party responds.
* Clearly distinguish  To and CC. The “To (recipient)’  column indicates  the person who will read the email and
give an opinion,  and the “Cc (reference)  column  reflects  the person  who will refer to the email.
+ Reply to all: If multiple  people collaborate  at the same time,  a full reply is sent with all relevant  stakeholders
included  for effective  information  sharing.  However,  if special security  is required,  use a single (general)  reply.
* Confirm the recipient:  Make sure to double-check  the “recipient”  before sending  an email to reduce security
and sending  errors
