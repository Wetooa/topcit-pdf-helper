@ Significance  and Importance  of Meetings
In definition,  a meeting  refers to an act of a group of people to discuss or a place thereof, and synonyms
include discussion  and consultation.  Generally,  in business,  a meeting  can be defined as a process  in which the
moderator  presents  a certain topic and the relevant  stakeholders  gather at a set time to discuss  and reach an
agreement.
As the various viewpoints  of meeting  participants  collide and converge,  creative  ideas can be derived and
unexpected  risks can be reduced.  Meetings  are the most effective  way to use collective  intelligence.
In order to take advantage  of these meetings  more systematically,  efforts should be made to take minutes  as
much as possible.  As the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty,  the UNESCO  World Heritage,  retain various minutes
of state management  for more than 500 years, helping to study the history, organizations  can accurately
understand  the history  of work and various  decisions  through  meeting  minutes.
