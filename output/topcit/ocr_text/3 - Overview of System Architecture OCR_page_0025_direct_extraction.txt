[Figure  2] Information  System  Components
+ Server
A server provides  the computing  power of an information  system. The information  system uses this computing
power to process  the business  logic and data by running  the application programs.  Server components  include  the
stacked  structures  of the computer's  hardware,  OS, middleware,  and application  programs.  The system  architecture
design defines  the server  capacity,  count, layout, and role, and the network  facilitates communication  between  the
servers. Mainframes,  Unix servers,  and x86 servers are the most commonly  used server types, and the x86 servers
using Intel CPUs have been used more often as the cloud services  expand.
For example,  the servers of an information  system providing  web services  include a webserver  that responds  to
user requests  through  a web browser,  organizes  web pages, and provides  a screen to display  the contents  to users,
a web application  server (WAS) that processes  business  logic, according  to the user request  and delivers  the results
to a database  server for storage,  or to a WAS for display, and a database  server that creates, requests,  modifies,
and deletes  data.
+ Network
A network  connects  the information  system components  for communication.  Network  devices  process
communication  between  servers, between  servers and storage  units, and between  the enterprise's  internal and
