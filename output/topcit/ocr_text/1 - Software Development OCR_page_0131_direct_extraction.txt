+ Preview  for practical  business Do we need to manage  open-source
software?
As more open-source  software  is used, the need for license management  is also increasing,  because
disputes  over licensing  can damage  a corporate  image and cause financial losses too. In particular,
the use of open-source  software  seems to be spreading  further in this era of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution,  which can also increase  dispute  factors.
As the source code of open-source  software  is opened, there are several benefits when developing
a technology  or product  that uses it, such as reducing  the development  time and cost, and breaking
technological  dependence.  However,  though anyone can use an open-source  license, users should
follow the license terms when distributing  it to a third party intending  to use it for technology  or
product  development.
Last year, a domestic  software  company  called Hangul and Computer  was sued for breach of
copyright  by Artifex in the U.S. on a charge of violating  the open-source  license. Artifex claimed
that Hangul and Computer  had violated  the license when selling “Hangeul’  programs  equipped  with
“Ghostscript”  (a PDF conversion  library), which was developed  and distributed  by Artifex with a GPL.
Artifex filed a lawsuit  in the California  court, and Hangul and Computer's  request  for its dismissal  was
rejected.  In the end, Hangul and Computer  had to pay the settlement  money  to end the lawsuit.
One official at the National  IT Industry  Promotion  Agency  said, “This incident  is a case which shows
how a corporate  image can be damaged  and financial  losses  incurred  by unauthorized  use of the GPL
code. This case reminded  us again of the importance  of complying  with open source software.’

us deterioration  of corporate  image and financial  loss due to the unauthorized  use of the GPL code.
The case reminded  us again of the importance  of complying  with the open-source  software.”
Disputes  over open-source  licenses are increasing  because  we did not introduce  and manage the
open-source  license systematically  due to the erroneous  perception that it is free of charge. In
addition,  open-source  licenses  are complex  as there are more than 2,000 types of license.  According
to a NIPA survey, 37% of domestic  SMEs violated  the license in 2016.
It was pointed out that we need to establish  an open-source  license management  system quickly,
because  the use of open-source  software  seems to be increasing  in the field of new technology  such
as the Internet  of Things (loT), artificial  intelligence  (Al), big data, cloud, etc.
It is essential  that enterprises  and public institutions  using open-source  software  take
countermeasures  such as establishing  governance  and utilizing license analytics  and verification
tools.
