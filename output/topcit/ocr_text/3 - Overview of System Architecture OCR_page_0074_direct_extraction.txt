from the technical  aspect in order for them to have the same level of complex  and highly integrated  structure  as the
human brain. Research  on neuromorphic  processors  with various materials  and structures  is ongoing  worldwide,  but
there is no clear leading  group with clear superior  competitiveness.
B) Quantum  computer
A quantum  computer  is a new conceptual  computer  that can simultaneously  process  a large volume  of information  at
a high speed, based on the principle  of ultra-high-speed,  large-capacity  computing  technology  optimized  for specific
operations,  according  to the principle  of overlapping  and entanglement  inherent  in quantum  mechanics.
Quantum  parallel processing,  which uses quantum  bits (qubits)  as a basic unit of information  processing,  exponentially
increases  information  processing  and computation  speed. <Table 13> shows the difference  from conventional
computer  structures.
