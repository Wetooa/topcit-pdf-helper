+ Preview  for practical  business Ariane 5’s explosion  attributable  to
poor software  design
Software  passes through a design process  that consists  in abstracting  the analyzed  requirements
into a computer  world. The design process  should include  the method  of handling  numerous  variables
defined  for the design, the variable  types used by an input value, and exceptions  due to error values.
Software  design faults are sometimes  eliminated  while repeating  tests such as boundary  value
analysis.  In addition,  redundant  data and server configuration  to cope with an emergency  should also
be designed  to support  the process  stably.
The Ariane 5 rocket exploded  during its launch on June 4, 1996 due to an inadequate  exception
design against  a mismatch  of the variable  types and insufficient  consideration  of redundancy  design.
The variable  types in the design were 16-bit integers,  yet 64-bit real type was entered.  However,
exception  handling  for integer-type  conversion  errors was not fully reflected  in the design, causing
overflow,  As a result, altitude  and velocity  information  was not sent to the central control  computer.
When a failure  occurred  in one SRI-2, the redundant  SRI-1 should have been activated. However,
as the architecture  was designed  in this way, There could be no effect due to an input value error.
Eventually,  Ariane 5 deviated  from its course and exploded  because  its engine nozzle angle and
thrust could not be controlled.
According  to the eventual  findings,  three exceptions  out of seven items were omitted  from Ariane 5
to achieve the SRI’s maximum  load target of 80%. As a result, it is said that software  development
was forced to bear all the responsibility  for the failure. After all, high-quality  software  design is not
guaranteed  by the design itself. To complete  high-quality  software, use cases that ensure the widest
possible test range should be reflected  in the development  and testing process,  which in turn will
make up for unexpected  defects.  This process  of supplementing  the design should be repeated.
