reduce its shipping  center operating  costs by 20% by using a warehousing  robot called Kiva. Amazon
developed  a plan to deploy  the robots in its shipping  center and acquired  the Kiva system in 2012 for $775
million. Over the past two years, the number  of robots deployed  has exceeded  15,000, resulting  in savings
of up to KRW 990 billion in human labor costs. This is one of the best examples  of a company  maximizing
its operational  efficiency  with IT technology.
