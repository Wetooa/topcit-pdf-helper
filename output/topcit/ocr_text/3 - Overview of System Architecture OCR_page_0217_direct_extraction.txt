02 Software-Based  Network
The technologies  that have recently  received  the most attention  in the network  field are software-defined  networks
(SDN) and network  function  virtualization  (NFV). Network  openness  and virtualization  technologies  are expected  to
change  the era when certain large equipment  makers  dominated  the global network  equipment  market  and increase
3rd party software  providers  and equipment  makers  to enter the market.
Korea has planned smart Internet-related  R&D and standardization  projects  focusing  on SDN and NFV to enhance
national  SDN technology  competitiveness,  led by ETRI, since 2012. Organizations,  such as the TTA Future Internet
Project  Group (PG220) and the Smart Internet  Technology  Standardization  Council actively  promote  domestic
standards  and reflect  international  standards.
A) Limitations  of the existing  communication  environment  and paradigm  shift
@ Changes  in traffic patterns
Current  applications  generate  a large volume  of traffic, by accessing  various  application  servers  and databases  before
providing  users data. The environment  is changing  from the limited communication  between  the client and the server
to access  between  various  systems.
@ Virtualization  technology
Virtualization  technology  has dramatically  increased  the number  of servers  connected  to the network,  fundamentally
changing  the assumptions  about the host's physical  location.
@ Networks  getting  more complex
Network  structures  are becoming  more complex,  as a large number  of computers  are configured  of discrete protocol
sets,
@ Difficulties  in network  design and management
Initial designs use  a link oversubscription  method that considers  the expected  traffic patterns  and the number
of concurrent  users. However,  it is becoming  more difficult  to predict the network  size, as traffic patterns  change
dynamically.
© Increasing  dependence  on equipment  manufacturers
In particular,  the core network  has had difficulties  in introducing  new services  or technologies  as certain major
equipment  manufacturers  dominated  the communication  market.
B) SDN (Software  Defined  Network)
SDN is a next-generation  network  technology  that can set the network  routing and control and complex  operation
management  through software  programming.  The technology  attracted  attention  when ONF introduced  the
OpenFlow  technology,  and international  standardization  organizations,  such as IETF and ITU-T, began to develop
standards  for SDN-related  core technologies.  There is heated competition  in the industry  for securing  leadership  in
