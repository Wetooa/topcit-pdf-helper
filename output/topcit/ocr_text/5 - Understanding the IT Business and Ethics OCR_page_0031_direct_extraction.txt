the IT business  environment.  In the first part, the general concept  of establishing  a strategy  is explained,  along with
he elements  that make up a strategy  and the process  involved  in establishing  a strategy.
n the second part, methods  of analyzing  the external and internal environments  are conducted  followed by an
analysis  the consolidated  environment  that considers  the external  and internal  environments  together.
For the analysis  of the external  environment,  the PEST technique  is employed  to analyze  the macro-external
environment  from the political, economic  social and technical  perspectives.  An explanation  is given of the 5-Force
industry  structure  analysis  technique  (ie. analysis  of the competitive  advantage  provided by IT business  through 5
‘actors including  the supplier  and buyer's negotiating  power, level of competition,  etc.), which is used to analyze the

environments  or aims of the organization  that could  have an impact  on the strategy.  A strategic  plan not only
provides  the basis for carrying  out the specific  action steps of the plan, but also provides  the overall direction  for the
enterprise  architecture  (EA), process  improvement,  risk management,  and portfolio  management,  and other types of
