Database )
the web client makes requests  frequently  or when the application  program  to link with the web is large, and that
performance  deteriorates  significantly  when there are too many connections.
@ CGl application  server  method
* The CGl application  server  method  separates  and executes  the application  program  accessing  the database  as
a daemon and transfers  the user's requests  by application  processor.  The CGI module is composed  of a small
executable  file and transfers  the request  received  from the web server  to the application  server  only.
+ The application process  includes  the fork, pre-fork,  and multithread  methods.  In particular,  the multithread  method
has the advantage  of a fast response  speed by using system  resources  most efficiently.
* The CGI application  server method has the advantage  of easy linking with middleware  such as CORBA and TP
Monitor,  while reducing  the size of the process  and keeping  the existing  system intact, but it also has the limitation
of being difficult  to implement.
@ Extended  API method
+ When the extended  API method  is used, a database  application  program  is executed  as a process  by linking it with
the web server. As the web server provides  APIs with extended  functions, it solves the problem  of the existing  CGI
method  wherein a new process  should be created each time a request is received.  Microsoft’s  ISAPI, Netscape’s
NSAPI, and Oracle's  Web Request  Broker  (WRB) belong  to this method.
* The extended  API method has the advantage  of saving more system resources,  reducing  more system load, and
providing  faster speed than the CGI method,  because  the routine  created  with the extended  API of the web server
is used as part of the server program.  However,  this method has the problem  that it is difficult  to create a routine
using an extended  API and becomes  dependent  on a specific  web server  or browser.
@ Servlet  method
+ The servlet method is similar to the extended  API method but is platform  independent.  JDBC (Java DataBase
Connectivity)  or another  database  access  class is used to connect  a database.
+ The serviet  method  has attracted  the attention  of many Java developers  because  it provides  continuous  processing
and a fast response  speed using Java’s multi-thread  features.
B) Browser  extension  method
The browser  extension  method processes  data while maintaining  the connection  by directly  connecting  a database
from a browser.  It is also called the direct (state) method.  JDBC, ADO (ActiveX  Data Object), and OLE DB belong  to
this method.
@ JDBC
+ A method of directly  connecting  a database  server from a Java applet or ActiveX  control. Specifically,  some
methods  use Java solutions  such as JDBC and JavaBeans.  When this method  is used, the limitations  of the web that
occur when linking  with mission-critical  systems  can be overcome  by connecting  a database  server  continuously.
+ JDBC is an API for the programming  language  Java, which is designed  to implement  an independent  Java application
program.  JDBC uses an integrated  SQL server, and another  database  can be connected  without  modifying  the
source by replacing  the driver or a module  that can be linked to it only.
