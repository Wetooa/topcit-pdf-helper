Since all sniffers  eavesdrop  on the network  by setting  their LAN cards to promiscuous  mode, a system running
a sniffer program  can be detected  by periodically  checking  if a specific host is set in promiscuous  mode. Ping,
ARP, DNS, or induction  method  can be used for detection.
® Spoofing  attack
Spoofing  is the act of disguising  and can apply to anything  related to communication,  such as the IP address,
host name, port number,  MAC address,  etc. A spoofing  attack technique  is used to attack other target systems
by disguising  its own identification  information.  The spoofing  attack is used for other attacks,  such as packet
sniffing,  DoS attack, and session  hijacking.
+ ARP spoofing
The ARP protocol  maps IP addresses  and MAC addresses,  whereas  ARP spoofing  attacks trick MAC
addresses.
As shown in [Figure 60], the attacker  first informs  the client of the fake MAC address  “CC”, corresponding
to the server (address:  10.0.0.2)  and notifies  the server of the fake MAC address  “CC”, corresponding  to the
client (address:  10.0.0.3).
Since an attacker  notifies its own MAC address  to the other communication  party (server and client
computer),  both the sever and the client send packets  to the attacker.
After the attacker  reads the packets  received from the server and the client, the server normally  sends the
packets  that the server  sends to the client, and the packets  that the client sends to the server. (As a result,
the attacker  can obtain the contents  of the communication  between  the server and the client.)

There are no fundamental  countermeasures  against  ARP spoofing,  because  it’s the problem of the TCP/IP
protocol  structure  itself. However,  the change of the MAC address  can be prevented  by setting the attributes
of the ARP table, using the arp command  to prevent  the change of the ARP table. To use this method,  the
setting  command  should be executed  every time the system is rebooted.
+ IP spoofing
An IP spoofing  attack hacks the host by changing  its IP address.  That is, an attacker  steals the IP address  of
other users and illegally  obtains  the rights to log on or others.
