Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics
>> Recent  trends and key issues
IT business  planning  starts with an understanding  of the company's  vision, goals, strategies and tasks,
and the first step is to build enterprise  architecture  (EA). In addition,  companies  also turn to information
strategy  planning  (ISP) when deploying  information  systems  for their IT division.
It is through  IT governance,  which stands  at the center  of this trend, that companies  establish  their system
of managing  their IT businesses.
Companies  that adopt EA are also deploying  an enterprise architecture management  system (EAMS)  for
managing  the continuous  upgrading  of the EA, and are working  hard to close the gap between  strategy  and
IT business.
In recent years, the public sector has begun to require a detailed  list of specifications  (i.e. a list detailed
enough to calculate  functional  scores) by including  it in the request  for a proposal (RFP) when awarding
a contract.  ISP is often carried out for each type of job to enable companies  to produce  this detailed
specification  list.
