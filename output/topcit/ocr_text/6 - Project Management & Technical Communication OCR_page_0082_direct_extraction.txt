According  to this agile spirit, various methodologies  such as Scrum, XP, and Kanban emerged.  Scrum, the
most representative  agile method,  first appeared  in 1995 when it was adopted  in software  development  by
Ken Schwaber  and Jeff Sutherland.  It is a mutually  progressive  development  methodology  for project  manage-
ment.
The Scrum process  consists  of sprint planning,  daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective,  and the
main deliverables  include  product  backlog,  sprint backlog,  and burndown  charts.
Daily scrum meetings  or sprint-level  reviews are held to manage  project quality through repetitive  reviews.
One of the most common  deliverables  is burndown  charts.

The PMBOK and ISO 21500 methodology  is a framework  of project management,  which is divided  into five
