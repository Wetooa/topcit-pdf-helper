With the IT business  process,  it is important  for a company  to optimize  the process in order to respond
quickly to changes  in its environment.  After the initial set-up, a process becomes  optimized  with the
passage  of time, with changes  in the business  environment  playing an important  role as an optimizing
factor.
To improve  the IT business  process on a continuous  basis, it is critical to monitor  bottlenecks  in the
process.  Companies  in this situation  usually  turn to BPR or PI to rectify  the bottleneck  issue,
The most challenging  task when pursuing  BPR or PI is to persuade  and convince  a company’s  own
employees.  This is because  it is humans  who operate  the process  and humans  who are also the subjects
of any process  innovations.  Therefore,  ceaseless  persuading  and the creation of  an atmosphere  in which
employees  feel they can share in the company’s  growth  are critical elements  to the success  of the process.
