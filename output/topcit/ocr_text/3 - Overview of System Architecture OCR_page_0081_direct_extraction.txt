processing  another  instruction  while still processing  an original instruction.  There are several types of pipelines:  a
two-stage  instruction pipeline,  a four-stage  instruction pipeline,  and  a six-stage  instruction  pipeline.  The four-stage
instruction  pipeline  is the most widely  used.
Although  the instruction  set consists  of two stages in the four-stage  instruction  pipeline, the processing  time of the
stages is divided into 4 in order to prevent  efficiency  degradation,  which occurs because  the processing  time of the
pipeline  stages  is not the same.
The stages of the four-stage  instruction  pipeline are instruction  fetching  (IF), instruction  decoding  (ID), operand
fetching  (OF), and execution  (EX).

The IF stage is a process  that fetches instructions  from the memory  unit. It fetches  an instruction  from the program
counter's  memory  unit address  and transfers  it to the register  The ID stage interprets  the fetched  instruction  using
an instruction  decoder.  The OF stage fetches an operand  that becomes  a variable  or data, to be used in operation,
from the memory  unit. The EX stage runs the operation  specified  by the instruction.
@ Superscalar  process
The Superscalar  process is a structure  that includes  a number  of instruction  pipelines  to speed up the central
processing  unit. It can run instructions  out of order, since it independently  processes  instructions  using multiple
pipelines.  The superscalar  process  has a basic configuration  in which several functional  units,that  are implemented  as
superscalar  pipelines,  support  the parallel processing  of instructions.
