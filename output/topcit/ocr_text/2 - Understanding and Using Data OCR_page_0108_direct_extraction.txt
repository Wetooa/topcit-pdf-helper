03 Data Control  Language  (DCL)
A data control language  is used to define and describe  data controls,  in order to use the database  in common.  The
main statements  include  GRANT,  REVOKE,  COMMIT,  and ROLLBACK.  Sometimes,  COMMIT  and ROLLBACK,  which are
used to control  nested  transactions,  are separated  and called TCL (Transaction  Control  Language).

@ GRANT

+ Example:  When granting  the privilege  of searching  the customer  table to user ABC.
-> GRANT  SELECT  ON customer  TO ABC ;
@ REVOKE

-> REVOKE  SELECT  ON customer  FROM ABC ;
@ DENY
This statement  is used to deny the user’s privilege  related to an object. If both GRANT  and DENY are assigned  at the

-> DENY SELECT  ON customer  TO ABC;
@ COMMIT
This statement  is used to complete  a transaction  and confirm  a data change.
