05 Extended  ER (EER: Extended  Entity-Relationship)  Model
The EER model adds several  useful concepts  to the basic ER model.
A) Generalization/Specialization
@ Generalization:  Separation  of one entity type (super  type) into multiple  sub-level  entity types (sub-type).
@ Specialization:  Integration  of multiple  entity types (sub type) into one upper-level  entity type (super-type).
© Generalization  and specialization  have an inverse relationship.  The generalization/specialization  relationship  is called
the IS-A relationship.
@ The concept  of inheritance  applies.

B) Aggregation
@ Aggregation  defines  a new entity with a set of multiple  entities.  It is called an IS-PART-OF  relationship.
@ The concept  of inheritance  does not apply.
