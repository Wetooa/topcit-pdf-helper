[Figure 29] Example  of the first normalization
@ Second  normalization  ([Figure  30])
+ The table on the left is not the second normal form.
+ The reason is that there is a partial functional  dependency  of the (course code) —> (course name) in the function
dependency  of the (student  ID) — (course  name).
+ The second  normal  form table is derived  by dividing  the un-normalized  table into two tables, as shown on the right.

+ The table on the left is not the third normal form.
+ The reason is that there is transitive  dependency  of the (student  ID) > (department),  (department)  — (department
office).
+ The third normal form table is derived  by dividing  the un-normalized  table into two tables, as shown on the right.
