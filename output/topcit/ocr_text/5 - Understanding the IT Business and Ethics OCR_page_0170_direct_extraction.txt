consolidate  dataa  value + Because  data can be accessed  and used freely, mesh-up using data is possible.
Network  effects + Network  effects and network  acceleration  can be expected  since data can be expanded
through  data linking.

Open data refers to data that anyone  can freely use, reuse, and redistribute,  and shall meet the following  conditions:
<Table  92> Description  of open data
Category Description
+ Data should be downloadable  over the Internet.
Availability  and Access + Transformation  of original  data/production  of new works should be possible  at reasonable  cost.
+ Data should be provided  in a convenient,  modifiable  form
+ Data should be reusable  and redistributable,  including  those used in combination  with otherReuse and Redistributiondatasets.
+ Everyone  must be able to use, reuse, and redistribute  the data.
Universal  Participation + For example,  there should be no restrictions  on “commercial”  or “non-commercial”  use or
restrictions  on use for specific  purposes  (such as education).

@ 3D Printing
A 3D printing  is a way of printing  3-dimensional  objects  using 3D data. The 3D data that is used as input is generated
from  a digital drawing, It is also known as additive  manufacturing,  since it builds three-dimensional  structures  by
stacking  layers of materials  that could be in powder,  liquid, or solid (threads,  wires, pellets)  state.
The reason why manufacturers  are paying attention  to 3D printing is that 3D printing is suitable  for customized
production  of small batches  of diverse range of products.  3D printing  improves  the manufacturing  environment
to satisfy consumers’  diverse needs, making it easy to customize  the product  quickly and easily to the needs of
consumers,  and providing  a one-person  manufacturing  environment  where consumers  can make their own products
In addition,  as the principal  of product  manufacturing  becomes  diverse  and the share of the manufacturing/
distribution  businesses  generated  by individuals  and small manufacturers  increases,  the reprocessing industry  for
product  commercialization  will also develop.  Until now, manufacturing  and consumption  were separate  domains,  but
3D printing  has allowed the boundaries  between  consumption  and manufacturing  to collapse  and meet the small
needs for manufacturing  in everyday  life. The next example  case is a product  called Button 2.0, which is an improved
button  that can be printed with a 3D printer. It has grooves  on the side for clamping  earphone  wires and was an idea
borne from the inventor's  frustrating  experience  of getting  his earphones  frequently  tangled  with the buttons  on his
shirt?"
