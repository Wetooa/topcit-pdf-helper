B) VoIP call signal protocol
VoIP call signaling  protocols  include SIP (Session  Initiation  Protocol)  and H.323. The SIP protocol  is an application
layer signaling  protocol  that specifies  a procedure  for intelligent  terminals  that are communicating  on the Internet  in
order to identify  each other, find their locations,  and create or delete a multimedia  communication  session between
them. The H.323 protocol  is an ITU-T standard  for providing  voice, data, and video services  on a LAN that does not
guarantee  quality. Startup  VoIP service providers  use it widely because  it can provide multimedia  services  without
changing  the existing  network's  underlying  structure.
@ SIP
SIP is an application  layer signaling  protocol,  used to establish,  modify, and terminate  multimedia  sessions.  It operates
independently  of the lower-layer  transport  protocols  and has scalability  as an HTTP text-based  protocol.
It controls  sessions  to enable call control in a circuit-switched  data network  in a packet-switching  network  and
multimedia  applications  on the Intemet,  which is a packet network.  It can support  text-based  addressing  methods  in
URL and E-mail format  and message  parsing  or extension.
