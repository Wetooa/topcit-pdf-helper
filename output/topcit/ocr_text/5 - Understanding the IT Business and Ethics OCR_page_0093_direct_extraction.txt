Collaboration  CRM
[Fig. 34] CRM classification
Categorizing  CRM in this way is only done for the purpose  of increasing  people’s  understanding  of CRM. In fact, the
ultimate  target of CRM is to get inside the minds of the customers.  In order to accurately  read the customers’  minds,
data analysis  has to be performed,  while assistance  from a business  support  system is also helpful. A diverse set of
customer  points of contact  (channels)  for interacting  with customers  has to be secured  as well.
The table below explains  the characteristics  of CRM (by category).
