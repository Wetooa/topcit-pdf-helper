+ Consideration  on the load after SSL application
Various  computing  tasks created  during the SSL handshake  process put a heavy workload  on the CPU. The
SSL accelerator  is a solution  released  to solve such a heavy workload  on the CPU. The SSL accelerator  can
be installed  on the server as a separate  PCI card or dedicated  equipment.  Recently,  since the web accelerator
and L4 switch provide an SSL accelerator  as a separate  function,  only a separate  SSL accelerator  license
needs to be purchased.
The connection  URL and the URL included  in the web application  source should be changed  to “https://”  after
applying  SSL. In addition,  the web application  response  speed can be improved  when the SSL load of the
static content,  such as images,  JavaScript,  CSS (CascadingStyleSheets),  etc. is increased,  using an SSL web
browser  cache or a web accelerator.
03 WLAN security
A) Characteristics  of the WLAN
Since incoming  and outgoing  data is broadcast  in the air in the wireless LAN, using radio waves, the  data is
exposed  to all wireless  LAN users while it is being transmitted.
The use of wireless  LAN is increasing  rapidly because  it has various  advantages  and convenience.  However,
security is more vulnerable  than wired LAN because  of the characteristic  of using radio waves as a
communication  medium.  Therefore,  security  should be considered  more seriously.  In particular,  there is a high
possibility  of various security  incidents  in the environment  that is opened to the public, like a public wireless
LAN. Therefore,  security  should be taken into account.
[Figure 66] shows the structure  of the general WLAN, defined by the IEEE 802.11. In this figure, the Basic
Service  Set (BSS) is a unit composed  of stations  (STAs)  that compete  for access  to the same wireless  medium,
while running  with the same MAC protocol.  And the extended  service set refers to an environment  in which
multiple  basic service sets can be connected  to a distribution  system  in order to communicate  with each other.
