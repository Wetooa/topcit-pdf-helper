@ The instance  object of a class corresponds  to the record of a table.
@ The attribute  of a class corresponds  to the column  of a table.
@ Class operation  has no corresponding  element  and is implemented  in the application  program.
B) Conversion  of the class relation  into a relational  relationship
@ Association
+ 1: Mrelationship  - the primary  key on side 1 is mapped  on to the foreign key on side M.
+ 1:1 relationship  - the primary  key of the side that is less frequently  accessed  is mapped  on to the foreign key of the
side that is most frequently  accessed,  or the two classes  are combined  into one class.
+ M: N relationship  - a new class corresponding  to the relationship  is created.
@ Aggregation
The table concerned  is referenced  using the foreign key.
@ Composition
Implementing  using a constraint
@ Generalization
+ The super class and each sub-class  are mapped  on to separate  tables.
+ (Or) A super-class  has all attributes  of the sub-class.
+ (Or) A sub-class  has the attribute  of the super-class.
09 Integrity  and Key
Data integrity refers to the need to protect data from lost updates  of data to maintain  their accuracy,  validity,
consistency,  and stability.  Three to five types of integrity  are defined depending  on the viewpoint.  Three types of
integrity  include entity, referential,  and domain integrity.  Five types of integrity  are also defined by separating  entity
integrity  into entity integrity  and key integrity,  and by including  user-defined  integrity.  To main integrity  in this way,
the primary  and foreign keys should be carefully  selected  and used.
A) Integrity
@ Domain integrity:  Domain integrity  means to ensure the integrity  of the field in a table. Data types, allowing  a null
value, etc. can be defined  and used. The attribute  value has atomicity  and should be a value defined  in the domain.
@ Key integrity:  All records  in a table should be identifiable  from each other.
© Entity integrity:  All tables must have a primary  key, and each primary  key must have a unique  value (but not null).
@ Referential  integrity:  Data in two tables in a reference  relationship  must always have consistent  values. A foreign key
must be a null value or a value that exists in the primary  key of the table referenced  by the foreign key. If there is a
