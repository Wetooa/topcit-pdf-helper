Company  K is a large-scale  trading  company  that aims to become  a world-class  e-trade company  that
can grow together  with its customers.  Company  K decides  to adopt IT service management  (ITSM) for
the purpose  of bringing  about effective improvements  to the quality of its maintenance  & repair of its IT
resources,  stabilizing  the operation  of its infrastructure,  and deploying  an advanced  operational  process.
In order to use the global standard  for ITSM, company  K applies  the following  criteria to the IT Infrastructure
Library (ITIL)-based  processes,  service levels, personnel,  etc.
+ |Implementation  of ITIL-based  processes  to improve  the operational  efficiency  of ITSM.
« Transparent  management  and real-time  monitoring  of service  levels.
« Preservation  of the high-quality  level of its services  through  effective  management  of suppliers.
« Development  of strategies  for preventing  malfunctions  and monitoring/analyzing  key logs in realtime.
Also, to aid in visualizing  the ITSM, company  K introduces  events/performance  management,  configuration
management,  malfunction  management,  report management,  and a dashboard  for operating  the help desk.
The dashboard  reports  the malfunction  status of each server by the type of malfunction  and the level of
severity.  Through  the dashboard,  company  K is made instantly aware of individual  events. It provides  a
framework  for quickly  recognizing  and responding  to various  situations  that may arise during the delivery  of
IT services.
As a result, company  K is able to quickly respond  to malfunctions  that occur during IT service delivery  by
communicating  them to the malfunction  manager  almost as soon as they occur. Furthermore, by building
a knowledge  DB of malfunctions,  the company  is able to establish  measures  for averting  the recurrence  of
similar  mishaps  in the future. In addition,  ITSM enables  the company  to carry out service-level  management
(SLM) using a system,  thereby  greatly contributing  to the comprehensive  evaluation  of service levels and
the building  of trust with customers.
