+ Digital textbooks
Digital textbooks  contains  the digital versions  of the contents  in existing  paper textbooks  and adds videos,
interactive functions,  and automatic  scoring  functions.  For example,  a digital textbook  could show moving images
of molecular  action between  liquids, solids, and gases, or an image of the Earth from outer space that zooms out by
moving  scrolling  key.
@ Smart health care
Smart healthcare  is a field that combines  digital devices  and IT devices  that connote  ‘smart’ and ‘healthcare’  which
refers to medical services.  Smart healthcare  is anticipated  to make a great leap forward  when it gets combined  with
loT, cloud computing,  Big Data, and Al, the so called core technologies  of the 4th Industrial  Revolution.  Therefore,
if interpreted  another  way, in smart health care, there is a set of data that are produced  by or measured  from
consumers  or patients.  Collecting  this data and analyzing  them using techniques  like Big Data are the specialized
firms. Then, based on the findings,  medical  institutions  provide  services  to consumers.
