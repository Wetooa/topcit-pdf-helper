Information  security )
® Technical  security  threats
+ There are various  types of attacks  in the technical  security  threat of the wireless  LAN, including  the leakage
of important  user information  through radio wave collection,  illegal access, and man in the middle attack:
jamming,  denial of service attack using large packet transmission,  and hacking  weak security  settings,  such
as WEP (Wired Equivalent  Privacy)  to illegally  access  and infiltrate into the internal network.
+ Most technical  security  threats to wireless  LAN can be blocked by setting security  features  provided  by the
wireless  AP (Access  Point), such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected  Access2).  However,  when using a wireless  LAN in
a place where important  information  is handled,  such as in a corporate  environment,  a professional  wireless
security  system,  such as WIPS (Wireless  Intrusion  Prevention  System)  must be introduced.
@ Administrative  security  threats
+ A strong security  technology  can be easily bypassed  if the threat is not properly  managed,  even though the
technology  is applied to the wireless  LAN. Administrative  security  threats include insufficient  management
of wireless LAN equipment  and devices, intrusion,  due to a lack of user security  awareness,  and allowing
outsiders to  access internal APs and insiders to access external  Aps, due to insufficient  radio wave
management.
+ To respond  to the administrative security  threat of wireless  LAN, management  plans for access devices and
terminals,  such as Aps, should be established  and implemented,  user awareness  should be raised periodically,
training  should be implemented,  and illegal internal  and external  accesses  should be checked.
© Physical  security  threats
+ Most network  devices  in the wired LAN environment  are installed  and managed  in a place that is difficult  to
access by general users. On the contrary,  most of the wireless  AP are exposed  and installed  outside  because
radio waves should be transmitted.  In this case, the wireless  AP is exposed  to risks, such as theft and
damage,  power shutdown,  LAN cable separation,  etc., so service  failure may occur. Also, if the wireless  device
is lost and stored WLAN access information  and security  setting information  is leaked, unauthorized  persons
can access  the wireless  LAN.
+ To prepare  for such a threat, it should be ensured  that the wireless  AP is not exposed  to the outside,  setting
information  should be changed  periodically,  and a method of managing  devices that use the WLAN, along
with a loss prevention  plan, should be devised.
C) Wireless  LAN security
@ IEEE 802.11i services
WEP was developed  to reinforce  the security  functions  of IEEE 802.11 (wireless  LAN standard).
However,  it is exposed  to various  attack techniques,  such as the brute force attack, due to insufficient  security
features.  Accordingly,  the 802.111 working  group has developed  various  functions  to solve the security  problem
of the wireless  LAN.
To protect  wireless  LAN users, the IEEE 802.11i standard  defines user authentication,  key exchange,  and
advanced  wireless  section encryption  algorithms.  It also satisfies  standardization  goals by implementing  IEEE
