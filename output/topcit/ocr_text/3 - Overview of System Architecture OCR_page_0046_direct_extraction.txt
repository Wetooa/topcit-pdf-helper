Overview  of System Architecture )
- Developed  by AT&T
- Multi-user  environment
- Commercial  products  mainly use the OS, as it is relatively  inexpensive.  Each
server  developer  develops  and installs  a proprietary  UNIX operating  system.
- Many open-source  versions  are available,  and the source  code is disclosed
Server  OS Linux - Low-cost  implementation
- Compatible  with UNIX
- Types: RedHat,  CentOS,  Ubuntu,  Fedora,  Suse, etc.UNIX
- Developed  by Microsoft
Windows  Server - Windows  interface  to provide  the same UI/UX
- Supports  many application  programs
02 Process  and Thread
A) Understanding  of process
Early computer  systems  could only execute  one application  program  at a time. In other words, one program  occupied
all the system's  resources.  However,  modern computer  systems  run multiple programs  concurrently.  The OS must
manage  computer  resources  so that multiple  programs  share resources  and operate  in stable condition  at the same
time. A process  refers to a running  program,  and in today’s concurrent  multi-process  environment,  it is a work unit of
a time-sharing  system.
@ Process  status
A process  has a distinct  process  status  during its lifecycle,  as shown in [Figure 16].

* Created:  A process  is created  but is not running  by the OS.
+ Preparing:  The process  is waiting  for the CPU allocation  to run.
