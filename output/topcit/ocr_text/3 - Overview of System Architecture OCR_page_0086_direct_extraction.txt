A disadvantage  of the DAS type is the limitation  of the number  of disks, and the difficulty  of management,  while
the NAS type has a problem  of possible  speed delay, depending  on the network  connection.  SAN was developed  to
overcome  the disadvantages. It uses a dedicated  fiber channel switch for fast connection,  and it enabled  the ability
to scale up the number  of connected  servers and storage,  with less impact to the connected  network  load. Using
the fiber channel  allows the connection  to speed up to 8Gbps - 16Gbps.  However,  it increases  costs since it requires
the dedicated  switch and expensive  cables, and it can cause a consistency  problem,  due to locking, when multiple
computer  systems  share a specific  file.
