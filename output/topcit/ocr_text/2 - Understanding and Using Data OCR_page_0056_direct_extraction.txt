04 ER Notation  Based on the Chen Model
The ER model presented  by Chen was the first data modeling  method  to represent  data configuration  and correlation.
This model is useful for understanding  the theoretical  concepts  of data modeling.

[Figure 12] ER model notation
A) Entity
@ An entity refers to a meaningful  unit of information  in the real world.
@ An entity includes  both physical  objects  and conceptual  objects.
+ Physical  object: student,  car, classroom
+ Conceptual  object: project,  job, subject
@ In general,  an entity has its own identifier  (key attribute)  and is represented  using a rectangle.
@ An entity without  its own identifier  is called a “weak entity’,  which is represented  using a two-line  rectangle.
B) Relationship
@ A relationship  refers to the correlation  between  entities  and is represented  using a diamond
Example)  The relationship  between  [student]  and [course]  is represented  as follows.
class
[Figure 13] Relationship  notation
@ The degree  of the relationship  represents  the number  of entities  participating  in the relationship.
+ Unary, binary, ternary, ---, N-ary
@ The cardinality  of the relationship  represents  the maximum  number  of relationship  instances  that can participate  in
the relationship.
+ There are one-to-one,  one-to-many  and many-to-many  relationships.
