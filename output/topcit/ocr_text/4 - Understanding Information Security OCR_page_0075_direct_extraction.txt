01 Need for securing  coding
A) Need for secure  coding
It was analyzed  that about 70% of cyber-attacks  exploit  the security  vulnerability  of software  itself. It was also
analyzed  that modification costs can be reduced by tens of times, compared  to the cost of modification after
the product  release.
Accordingly,  removing  security  vulnerabilities in the software  development  phase is highlighted  as an effective
method  before releasing  the product,  to prevent  and respond  to cyber-attacks.
Secure coding  is a defensive  programming  technique  that reduces  software  vulnerabilities  and hacking  risks, by
removing  security  weaknesses  in the software  development  lifecycle  (SDLC).
02 Main content  of secure  coding
A) Software  security  weakness  and security  vulnerability
@ Weakness:  Errors occurring  in the design and implementation  phase, such as software  defects, errors, and bugs.
Software  weakness  can cause software  vulnerabilities.  A representative  example is the Common  Weakness
Enumeration  (CWE).
® Vulnerability:  An error in software  that can be accessed  and used by hackers,  by accessing  the system or network.
Hackers  can exploit  this accessible  security  weakness.  An example  is the Common  Vulnerabilities  and Exposures  (CVE).
