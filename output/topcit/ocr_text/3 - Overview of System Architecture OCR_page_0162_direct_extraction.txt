© Routing  table
A routing table is a database  that stores the output interface  of each destination  network  and the next hop IP
address.

E) What is a switch?
A switch is a device that connects  network  units. A switch device has an important  role in MAC address learning,
filtering,  and loop prevention.  Other switch functions  include port mirroring  and VLAN. Port mirroring,  also called
port monitoring,  is the function  of sending  a replicate  of the data sent from a specific  port to a mirrored  port. It is an
important  function  used by administrators  to monitor  network  traffic through  the mirrored  port.
<Table 41) Main Switch Functions
Function Description
Address  learning - Learning  the MAC address  of all systems  that are connected  to a port
Filtering - Filtering  data traffic to a specific port using the MAC address
Wooneevention - Preventing  a network  loop when multiple  paths to a destination  are generated
PP - The system usesa spanning  tree protocol (STP) to prevent  the network loop.
F) Virtual local area network  (VLAN)
VLAN is a method  of configuring  a logical network,  desired by the user, to overcome  the physical and regional
constraints  of the existing  networks. In other words, it uses the IP unit, protocol  unit, MAC address,  and connecting
port to configure  a logical network, instead of separating  networks  by spatial and geographical  locations.  The VLAN
protocols  of a switch include ISL, 802.1Q,  and VTP. ISL and 802.1Q are the VLAN tagging  protocols,  and VTP is a
VLAN management  protocol.
