Often, the work breakdown  structure (WBS) is misunderstood  as a schedule  management  output or
tool. This is because  it is used to track progress  of a project  as the start and end dates are specified
in the work package  (the lowest unit of work), which is a component  of the WBS. Moreover,  it is
not unusual to think that WBS exists for schedule  management  as the commonly  used schedule
management  tool of Microsoft  has a structure  that manages  the schedule  with WBS uploaded  in the
form of a file.
However,  it is clear that WBS is a deliverable  of scope management  because  it is included  as “Create
WBS” in PMBOK  (Project  Management  Body of Knowledge)  of PMI (Project  Management  Institute).
Then, why is it important  to distinguish  “whether  WBS is a deliverable  of scope management  or
schedule  management.”  This is because  WBS plays a very important  role in scope management.
When scope changes  in a project,  i.e. when requirements  change  or are added, the first thing to look
at is the WBS. If you are aware that WBS is used for managing  changes,  you can manage  any related
elements  from schedule,  cost, and to quality all at once.
From now on, let's use WBS as a tool for scope management  rather than schedule  management!
01 Concept  and Process  of Scope Management
A) Concept  of scope management
The first of the three important  knowledge  areas in project  management  is scope management.  Since a proj-
ect is a unique, temporary,  and goal-driven  activity, it is important  to have a clear goal and scope to make it
successful.
In a project, it is necessary  to do what needs to be done and exclude  anything  that is unnecessary,  even if demand-
ed by the client. As a project  manager,  the first thing to do is to clarify and define the scope of his or her work.
