03 Requirements  Change  and Tracking  Management
A) Overview  of requirements  traceability
Once the requirements  baseline is established  and the project starts, changes  to the requirements  will
inevitably  occur. Requirements  change management  is the process  of formally  controlling  all changes  that
occur based on the requirements  baseline.  The consistency  and integrity  of changes  can be provided  by
controlling  and tracking  formal changes  to the requirements  that arise in the course of executing  the project.
Errors occur while changing  the requirements  for the following  reasons:
+ Requirements  errors, conflicts,  and inconsistencies  occur.
+ The participants  develop  a deeper  understanding  and greater  knowledge  of the system
+ Changes  occur in the system  environment  and organization.
+ Technical,  time, and cost problems  arise.
The above types of errors can be reduced by defining  and configuring  the traceability  of the requirements.
Tracking  the requirements  does not mean that each requirements  document  is traced, but rather that the
requirements  in each sentence  of the requirements  document  are traced. The concept  of tracing each
sentence  can be easily understood  by referring  to the figure below.
