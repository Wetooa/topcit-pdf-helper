03 Concept  of EA
A) Overview  of EA (Enterprise  Architecture)
© Definition  of EA
EA stands for “enterprise  architecture’.  It is a blueprint  that explains  the IT business  of an enterprise  in a way that is
easy for the stakeholders  to understand, so that the enterprise  can achieve  its strategic  goals and the goals of its
information  resource  management.
“Enterprise  architecture  is a blueprint  that defines the current  state of the relationship  between  information
technology  and an enterprise(as  well as the activities  carried out by the enterprise)  and the state that the enterprise
must strive for in the future.’-United  States Office of Management  and Budget  (OMB)
@ Need for EA
Currently,  enterprises  are enthusiastically  introducing  information  systems  to cope with the rapidly changing  business
environments,  but if information  systems  are deployed  without  proper planning  at the macro level, enterprises  will
be confronted  with a redundant  system and an inability  to collaborate.  Such enterprises  will fall into the so-called  "IT
Productivity  Paradox’1  which can be described  as the continuous  adoption  of information  systems  without  seeing
any benefits  in the form of increased  corporate  profits.
