Database
>> Recent  trends and major issues
Even though the types of databases  have been diversified  recently,  most of the information  systems  used
by corporations  and organizations  are still running  on relational  databases.  Therefore, software  developers
should be familiar  with relational  database  language  and query processing  methods  and should be able to
use them proficiently  in order to process  data efficiently.
SQL was developed  by IBM researchers  Donald D. Chamberlain  and F. Raymond  Boyce in the early 1970s.
SQL began with the name of SEQUEL  (Structured  English  Query Language)  and was devised  to manipulate
and receive  the data stored in System  R, which was the semi-relational  database  management  system of
IBM. Recently,  interest  in acquiring  SQL-related  certifications  has been increasing  because  the importance
of SQL has been highlighted.
