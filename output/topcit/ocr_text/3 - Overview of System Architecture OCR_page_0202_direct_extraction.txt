Overview  of System  Architecture
>> Recent  trends and issues
As high-speed  data transmission  becomes  possible  and various convergence  technologies  emerge,
cutting-edge  technologies  are also appearing  in the network  field. With the advent of technologies  that
guarantee  traffic quality in Internet  networks,  multimedia  and Internet  telephony  services have been
launched.  In recent  years, Internet  of Things  (loT) network-based  technologies  are expanding  together  with
standardization  organizations  and groups. Moreover,  software-based  networks,  that are differentiated  from
the existing  network  structure,  are being introduced.  This chapter  discusses  the recent network  trends and
major issues.
