@ MapReduce
MapReduce  is a programming  model designed  for the parallel distributed  processing  of big data using inexpensive
machines.  This model can process  large amounts  of data in parallel using a program  composed  of a map procedure
and a reduce  method.  MapReduce  allows the analysis  of large-scale  data by processing  data that has been distributed
and stored in multiple machines.  Basically,  MapReduce  performs  batch-based  processing  and can handle large-scale
data conveniently.  The data of the execution  result is copied, distributed,  and stored safely in consideration  of the
failure of the physical  device.
C) Visualization  technology
This technique  provides  insights  by effectively  transferring  numbers,  statistics,  and valuable  meanings,  by classifying
data for the user’s easy understanding,  and by analyzing  large-scale  data. It allows the exact and effective  transfer  of
information  without  actually  requiring  the user to look at the data.
