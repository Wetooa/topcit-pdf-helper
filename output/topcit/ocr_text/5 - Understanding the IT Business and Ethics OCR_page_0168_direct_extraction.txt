Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
Virtual currency  or virtual money is defined as a digital currency  or electronic  currency  used in electronic  form in a
virtual space on a network  without  any physical  bill or coins.
According  to the definition given by the European  Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Treasury  Department,  and the
European  Bank Oversight  Office, virtual currency  is a type of digital currency  that is issued and managed  by
developers  and is not controlled  by the government.  It used only in certain virtual communities  as a form of payment
and most crypto currencies  can be seen as a digital currency  and a virtual currency.

+ Reasons  for the rise in the value of virtual currencies
Most virtual currencies  such as Bitcoin have fixed amount  of final issuance,  and if the method of block production
through large scale calculations  is maintained,  scarcity  is created by the consumption  of physical resources  for
mining. In addition,  virtual currencies  produce  a network  effect that increases  their value because  they are held
simultaneously  by multiple people. The value of virtual currency  increases  due to scarcity  and network  effects.
However,  the value of virtual currency  cannot  be explained  just with its scarcity  and network  effect.
* Can it be said that the currency  is the essence  of virtual currency?
The 3 important  functions  of currency  are "storage  of value’ "exchangeable’,  and "scale of value’. In the case of virtual
currencies  such as Bitcoin,  the price volatility  is so severe that it cannot  perform  the "scale of value” function  and thus
it cannot  be recognized  as a true currency.  The opinion of most experts  is that virtual currency  can never displace  a
nation’s  legal currency.  However,  it has been verified by Ethereumthat  a virtual currency  can provide services  beyond
its use as a mode of payment.  It should be noted that the increasing  value of payments  and other services  of virtual
currency  can increase  the price of virtual currency  itself
+ Major virtual currencies
More than 1,100 types of virtual currencies  are currently  listed and in use worldwide.  However,  Bitcoin and Ethereum
account  for more than 70% of the value of virtual currency  based on market  capitalization.
