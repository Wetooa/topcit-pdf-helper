+ Reasons  behind the emergence  of smart water grid”
The smart water grid emerged  as a result of the spread of cloud computing,  the increased  supply of intelligent  meter
infrastructure,  the impact  of climate  change,  and the growing  interest  in the global water industry.
<Table 80> Reasons  behind  the emergence  of smart water  grid
Category Explanation
A system  can be developed  that automatically  detects  information,  stores them in the cloud.
When  a problem  occurs, it can be resolved  automatically  because  of the stored information.
Based on a bi-directional  network,  operations  can be handled  efficiently  because  suppliers  and
consumers  share information.Spread  of cloud computing
Using the automated  detection  technology  activated  by remote  monitoring  technology,  the
usage data of the water supply  can be acquired  in real time. This makes it easier for suppliers  and
consumers  to calculate  fares and reduce  water usage.Intelligent  inspections
infrastructure  supply
Due to rapid climate  change,  agricultural  water shortages  in the water resources  sector  and
Impact  of climate  change —_ changes  in river flow rates, increased  uncertainties  are expected  in the development  and
operation  of water resources.  Increased  damage  from drought/flood  is also predicted.
The increasing  world population,  the industrialization  of developing  countries  has led to increased
Impact of climate change demand for water. This has in turn increased interest in the supply of water resources.
+ Key technologies  of smart water grid
The technologies  that are critical to the smart water grid are water resource  acquisition/distribution  technology,
real-time  and automated  water supply and demand  management  technology,  and advanced  ICT convergent  water
management  technology.

Smart transportation  is an intelligent  transportation  service that improves  traffic safety, improves  the efficiency  of
traffic flow, and provides  user convenience  through  the exchange  of information  among different  vehicles,  among
vehicles,  base stations  and infrastructure,  and among  vehicles  and traffic control servers.
