05 Scheduling
OS supporting  multiple  programming  uses scheduling  to allocate  processes  to the CPU efficiently,
A) Purpose  of scheduling
+ Fairness  to processes
+ Maximizing  throughput  per unit time
+ Minimizing  response  time
+ Predictable  execution  time
+ Preventing  system  overload
+ Balanced  resource  utilization
+ Preventing  indefinite  process  execution
+ Implementing  priority  schemes
B) Type and characteristics  of scheduling
<Table 8> shows the types and characteristics  of scheduling  algorithms.
+ Preemptive  scheduling:  A process  can take CPU resources  while another  process  is occupying  them.
+ Non-preemptive  scheduling:  If a CPU resource is allocated  to a process,  it cannot  be allocated  to another  process
until the task has been completed.
