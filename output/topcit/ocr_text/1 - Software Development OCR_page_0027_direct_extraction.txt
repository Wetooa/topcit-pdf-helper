@ Testing
+ Testing refers to a series of processes  to inspect  and evaluate  whether  the system satisfies  the prescribed
requirements,  and how the expected  and actual results differ, using the manual or automated  method.
+ Testing  is the final step in assuring  software  quality. It is a series of tasks designed  to find faults so as to
ensure software  quality.
+ Testing includes  a quality evaluation  of the developed  software  and a series of modification  tasks for improving
quality.
04 Agile Development  Methodology
A) Types of agile methodologies
Since the release of the Agile Manifesto  for Software  Development,  various agile methodologies  have emerged.
Among them, Scrum and Extreme  Programming  (XP) are the most widely adopted  agile methodologies
throughout  the world. XP was mainly used in the early days, but Scrum and XP are generally used together
these days, as Scrum has gained popularity.  Recently,  the Lean software  development  methodology,  whereby
the lean production  method of the Toyota system is applied to software development,  has emerged.  It is
mainly used with Scrum.
The main agile methodologies  are as follows:
+ Scrum, Ken Schwaber/Jeff  Sutherland
+ EXtreme  Programming  (XP), Kent Beck/Erich  Gamma
+ Lean software  development  methodology,  Mary Popendic/Tom  Poppendieck
+ Agile Unified Process  (AUP), Scott Ambler
B) Agile development  methodology  - XP
@ XP overview
XP (eXtreme  Programming)  is a methodology  that was established  by Kent Beck and several other engineers
in the late 1990s, based on the lessons they learned while implementing  projects.  This methodology  is a
lightweight  development  method generally  suitable for small and medium-sized  development  organizations.
There is some controversy  about whether  to define XP as a “methodology”  because  it is largely related to
development  techniques  such as Test-Driven  Development  (TDD), Daily Build, and Continuous  Integration.  In
Korea, small development  teams usually apply some of the techniques.  In addition,  more teams apply additional
agile development  methods  such as Scrum together,  rather than insisting  on XP alone. XP is composed  of
the value and the practice  of achieving  the value when it is applied, and a principle  is needed to maintain  the
balance between  the two. XP is a kind of iterative  development  methodology.  There are several iterations
during the course of a project,  and tasks are repeatedly  performed  depending  on the test results.
@ XP development  procedure  and terminology
The XP development  procedure  is performed  as shown in the following  figure.
