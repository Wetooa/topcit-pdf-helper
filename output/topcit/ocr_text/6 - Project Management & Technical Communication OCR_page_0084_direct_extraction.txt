Project  Management  and Technical  Communication
>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
The biggest  cause of project failure is scope change caused by repetitive  requirements  changes.
Frequent  scope change in and after mid-project  delays the schedule,  which in turn leads to higher
costs such as hiring or paying overtime.  For the successful  execution  of a project, it is necessary
to understand  the scope management  process  that collects  requirements  and defines, verifies and
controls  scope.
