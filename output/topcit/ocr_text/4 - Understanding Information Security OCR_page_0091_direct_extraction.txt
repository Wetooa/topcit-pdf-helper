C) Types of database  encryption
There are various  types of database  encryption,  such as the API type, plug-in type, TDE type, and hybrid type
or proxy type, that combines  the API and plug-in type.
@ API method
API type database  encryption  performs  encryption/decryption  by installing  an encryption/decryption  module
inside an application  program  server. It requires  the modification  of multiple  application  programs,  and data is
transmitted  after encryption  between  the AP server and database  server. There is a low possibility  that a load
is created  in the database  server, but a load is likely to be created  in the AP server.

[Figure  42] API type database  encryption
If the application  program is easy to modify and the performance  of the database  server is poor, it is
recommended  to select this type, as data is transmitted  after being encrypted  through  the network.
@ Plug-in  type
When the plug-in type is used, the encryption/decryption  module is installed  inside the database  server in
order to perform  encryption/decryption.  A load on the database  server may be created and data is exchanged
between  the AP server and database  server in plain text when it is encrypted/decrypted.
