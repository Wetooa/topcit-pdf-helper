@ BASE attributes  of NoSQL
<Table  76> Description  of NoSQL’s  BASE properties
Item Contents
- Emphasis  is placed on availability  and the use of optimistic  locking  and queue.
- Availability  is ensured  even with multiple  failures  and copies  are stored in multiple  storages.
- Node status is determined  by the information  transmitted  from outside.Basically  Available
et - Updates between distributed  nodes are updated when data reach the node.
Eventually . . ; ; . .Consistent The property  of maintaining  consistency  optimally  even though  consistency  is lost temporarily.
@ Comparison  of BASE attributes  and ACID attributes
<Table  77> Comparison  of BASE attributes  and ACID attributes
Attribute BASE ACID
Application  field - NoSQL - RDBMS
Scope - Characteristics  of the entire system. ~ Limited  to transactions.
Consistency  aspect ~ Weak consistency. - Strong  consistency.
Main points ~ Focused  on ‘availability’. - Focused  on “commit”.
System  aspect - Focused  on “performance”. - Focused  on “strict data management’.
Efficiency - “Query design’ is important. - “Table design’ is important.
C) Storage  method  of NoSQL
NoSQL  databases  can be divided as follows  from the viewpoint  of the data model that stores data.
<Table  78> Types of NoSQL
Type Description
+ The most basic NoSQL  database  that provides  simple and fast Get, Put, and Delete
Key-value  based functions  based on the key-value.
+ Dynamo,  Redis, MemcacheDB,  etc.
+ An NoSQL  database  that stores data in rows in the column  family, which corresponds
Column  family  based to the table in the relational  database.
+ Cassandra,  HBase, SimpleDB,  etc.
+ An NoSQL  database  that stores documents  such as XML, JSON, BSON, etc. in the
value part of the key-value  database,  such as NoSQL  DB, MongoDB,  CouchDB,  etc
+ An NoSQL  database  that expresses  the entry attribute  of the relational  database  as
a node and the relationship  as the edge between  nodes, such as Neo4J, Flock DB, etc.Document  based
Graph based
