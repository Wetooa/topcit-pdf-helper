Class Address Description
Network  ID: First octet
A 1.0.0.0 ~ 126.0.0.0 Host ID: Last three octets
Default  subnet  mask: 255.0.0.0
Network  ID: First two octets
B 128.0.0.0  ~ 191.255.0.0 Host ID: Last two octets
Default  subnet  mask: 255.255.0.0
Network  ID: First three octets
Cc 192.0.0.0  ~ 223.255.255.0 Host ID: Last one octet
Default  subnet  mask: 255.255.255.0
D 224.0.0.0  ~ 239.0.0.0 Multicast  address
E 240.0.0.0  ~ 255.0.0.0 Experimentally  used
In the IPv4 address  designation  method,  subnetting  is the address  partition  method used to separate  a network  ID
into multiple  network  Ids, and supernetting  is a met!hod of integrating  multiple  networks  into a large network.
The 169.254.0.0  network band is reserved  for automatic  private IP addressing.  For versions  after Windows  2000,
DHCP automatically  generates  it to set the IPv4address and cannot  be routed on the Internet.  The addressing
system  is called the automatic  private IP addressing  (APIPA).
C) Special  IPv4 address
In IPv4, there is an addressing  system in a different  form from the conventional  A, B, and C class addressing  system.
These addresses  are called the special IPv4 addresses.  <Table 52> below shows the special IPv4 addresses.
(Table 52) Special IPv4 Address  [7]
Network  ID Host ID Address  name Usage

Allo specific | Specific  host on this network + Indicates  a specific  terminal  inside the connected  network
+ Not able to pass through  routers
17XXX Local loopback  address + Used as the destination  address  for loopback  inside the
system
