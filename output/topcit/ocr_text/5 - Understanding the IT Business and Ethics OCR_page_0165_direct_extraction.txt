@ FinTech
FinTech is a composite  word created from “Financial”  and “Technology”  and refers to services  like payments,
remittances,  asset management,  cloud funding,  and loans, where traditional  financial  services  are integrated  with IT
technologies.
Originally,  it was the term used for describing  a large vendor  who develops  services  exclusively  for financial
institutions,  but it is now used to refer to the various  services  offered by financial  startups.
Traditional  financial institutions  (usually the offline sales branches)  have been able to secure security  and reliability
through powerful  security  system and database  link to traditional  institutions.  In payment  services,  credit card
companies  have led the market  by dominating  the market  early. However,  some of the newer  fintech firmsare  able to
provide  services  based on smartphone-based  mobile devices, financial management  through  Big Data analysis,  and
credit risk assessment  at significantly  lower costs than existing  financial  institutions.  In payment  services  too, fintech
companies  are able to provide  smart-phone  services  that are convenient  and has great security  of accessibility.
The growth  of fintech services  can be attributable  to the following  factors.
- The popularization  of mobile services,  open source codes that can be developed  and applied freely, the emergence
of cloud technology  and the demand  for new financial services  from financial  consumers  have resulted  in the
growth  of the startup  scene.
- Because  fintech are Internet-based  services,  this means initial investment  costs and labor costs can be very low.
So people feel little burden  when investing  in fintech  development.
- As consumers  flock to mobile financial  transactions  that are faster and cheaper  than the financial  services  offered
by existing  banks, many companies  are showing  interest  in fintech development.
Fintech services  could become  a serious threat to traditional  financial  companies.  In payment  and remittance,  the
ease of customer  acquisition  and accessibility  of services  provided  by the scalable platform  will pose a threat. In
lending  and investments,  the high predictability  provided by social data and Big Data will pose  a threat. In particular,
payment  and remittance  services  are services  that are frequently  used and have strong platform  characteristics.  For
this reason, new companies  like to use it as a stepping  stone when starting  other financial  services.  In fact, Alibaba
provides  various  financial  services  based on Alipay, a payment  service.
