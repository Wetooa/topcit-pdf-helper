>p> Recent  trends and issues
With the advent  of mobile platforms,  such as Android and iOS, since the mid-2000s,  society  has rapidly
transformed  into the mobile era, as applications  useful for work and personal  leisure have emerged.  Some
programs  use standard  application  layer protocols,  such as SMTP, POP3, IMAP. and FTP. and some others,
like SNS, use their own application  layer protocols,  such as KakaoTalk,  Line, and Facebook.  Developers  can
only develop  user-friendly  application  programs  when they have a good understanding  of the concept  and
operation  method  of the application  layer protocol  operating  on the transport  layer.
