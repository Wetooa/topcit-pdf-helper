Information  systems  have the role of not only supporting  business,  but also creating  business.  A failed bank
information  system can have an enormous  impact. A fire at OO Card's IDC center in 2014 is a similar  case.
Enterprises  must improve  the availability of information  system services,  through a high availability  (HA)
configuration  or disaster  recovery  (DR) center in order to ensure that their information  system safely and
continuously provides  service. Most major information  systems  are basically  configured  with redundancy.
An important  banking  system has a spare system, in addition  to redundancy,  to ensure that the reserve
system can continue  to provide information  services  at the time of disasters,  such as an earthquake  or
a fire. The DR center is a place that provides  such a spare system.  DR centers are configured  in different
ways, depending  on the importance  of the information  system.  When  a failure or disaster  occurs, the time
required  to recover  in order to provide normal service is called the recovery  time objective  (RTO). Moreover,
the tolerable  level of data loss in a failure or disaster  is called a recovery  point objective  (RPO). The DR
center is classified  into a mirror, hot, warm, or cold site, based on RPO and RTO. This section describes
techniques  for providing  service  continuity  of information  systems.
01 High Availability  (HA)
A) Concept  of HA
In information  systems,  HA refers to an uninterrupted  service. However,  it is not easy to make a system,that  consists
of numerous  parts and software,  100% available.  There must be no failure, or services  must be available  to users in a
usable state, even at the time of failure, in order to guarantee  uninterrupted  availability.  In general,  the system  fails at
some point. Therefore,  the way to guarantee  service  continuity  is to prepare  for failure, rather than preventing  failure.
HA prepares  for failure by configuring  two or more systems  using clustering.
A typical HA criterion  targets  99.999%  (called 5 nines), representing  less than 5 minutes  and 15 seconds  of unplanned
service downtime  per year. The scale of the HA level is expressed by the number  of nine, and the  formula for
calculating  the availability  is the mean time between  failures  (MTBF),  divided by the sum of the MTBF and the mean
time to repair (MTTR).
