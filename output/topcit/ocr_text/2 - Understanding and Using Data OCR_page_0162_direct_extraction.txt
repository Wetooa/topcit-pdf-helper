Characteristics Description
DNN+ An artificial  neural network  that is composed  of multiple  hidden layers between  the input layer
and the output  layer in order to build a complex  and expressive  model by overcoming  the
limitations  of ANN.
+ Anartificial  neural network  structure  composed  of multiple  hidden layers.
input layer
CNN+ Convolutional  Neural Networks
+ Aneural  network  algorithm  with a structure  suitable  for image data processing,  using the
mechanical  principle  of the organisms  optic nerve.
+ Itis composed  of the convolution  layer > pooling  layer > convolution  layer > pooling  layer > feed
forward  layer.

RNN+ Recurrent  Neural Network
+ Aneural  network  in which the connections  between  units, which constitute  an artificial  neural
network,  compose  a directed  cycle.
+ Analgorithm  that creates  a relationship  which produces  multiple  values  when one value is
entered.
+ It connects  the past neural network  (T-1) and the current  neural network  (T), and learns using an
algorithm  called BPTT (Back-Propagation  Through  Time), which is an extension  of error back-
propagation,  a learning  algorithm  of the existing  artificial  neural network.
