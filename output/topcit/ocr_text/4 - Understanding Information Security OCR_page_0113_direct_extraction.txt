+ Secret information,  to be used by the conversion  algorithm,  should be created.
+ A method  for distributing  and sharing  confidential  information  should be developed.
+A security  algorithm  for a specific security  service and a protocol,  to be used by the two communicating
entities  that will use secret information,  should be designated.
@® Network  access  security  model
An attacker  tries to infiltrate  into the information  system to damage it or to destroy  or steal personal
information.  In addition,  malware,  such as a virus or worm, can infect the information  system through  the
network.
Security  response  techniques against such unwanted  access can be divided into two categories,  as shown
in [Figure 56]. The first category  is the method of denying  access to the information  system, except for the
authorized  users, using the gate keeper  function.  The log-in procedure  using a password  falls into this category.
Once accessed  by the user or software,  the second-phase  response  is performed  by the internal security
control function.  An intrusion  detection  system (IDS) that monitors  the activity status of an information
system and detects  an intruder  can be selected  as the representative  method of performing  internal security
control.
