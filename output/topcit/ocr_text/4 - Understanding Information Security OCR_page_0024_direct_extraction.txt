01 Cryptographic  techniques
A) Concept  of a cipher
Encryption  is the process of converting  plain text, which can be seen by anyone, into an incomprehensible
form of ciphertext.  Decryption  is the process  of converting  ciphertext  back into plaintext,  so that it can be
understood.  These two processes  are called cryptography.  The mathematical  function  used in these two
conversion  processes  is called a cryptographic  algorithm.  The cryptographic  algorithm  uses a key to perform
encryption  and decryption. In short, encryption  is an important  means to obtain confidentiality,  which is one of
the three main goals of information  security.
B) Encryption  and decryption
Encryption  is the process  of converting  plain text into a form (ciphertext)  that cannot  be recognized  by a third
party, whereas  decryption  is the reverse process  of encryption. That is, decryption  is the process  of restoring
converted  ciphertext  back into plaintext.

Initially, encryption  was mainly used for military purposes.  However,  it is used to protect  a variety  of important
information  with the development  of information,communication,  and Internet  technology.
C) Classification  of cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  are classified  into the cryptographic  technique  and cryptographic  protocol  technique.
@® Cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  can be divided  into the symmetric  key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption  key
and the decryption  key are the same, and the public key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption  key and the
decryption  key are different,  depending  on whether  the encryption  key and the decryption  key are the same.
