Cloud computing  is a technology  that lets people user IT resources  (networks,  servers, storage,  and service
applications) through  the Internet  as a service whenever  they need them, without  ever having to own them. This
implies the IT services  could be provided  better and cheaper  anytime  and anywhere.  Different  organizations  each
define the concept  of cloud computing  in their own different  ways. Gartner  defines cloud computers  as a form of
computing  that leverages  Internet  technology  to provide high-level,  scalable  resources  to many customers  as a
service. Forest Research  defines cloud computing  as computing  that provides  standardized  IT based functions
through  IP. access to computing  at any time, computing  power that varies based on the level of demand,  provides
billing model based on the usage level or advertising  and provides  web or programmable  interface.
Cloud computing  is not a new technology,  but it existed as a concept  for a long time in the IT community.  But
it emerged  as a market issue as companies  began to show interest  in cloud computing  to reduce costs in the
wake of the global economic  recession.  Cloud computing  can be seen as a form of rental business.  With improving
virtualization  technology,  it became  possible  to integrate  the IT resources  located in different  spaces into a single
system  for service.
The characteristics  of cloud computing  are summarized  in the table below.

Category Description
Cloud computing  can dynamically  meet customer  requirements,  and customers  can buildin-Demand - ooOpe infrastructure  with minimal infrastructure  investment.
Cloud computing  is scalable  and can be used whenever  resources  are needed  and returned  whenScalability they are not needed
Cloud computing  is available  through  networks  and accessed  through  basic mechanism  that
Broad Network  Access stimulate  the use of thick or thin client platforms.
+ The computing  resources  of the cloud service provider  are pooled in multi-ownership  structure
so that multiple  different  customers  could be supported.
+ Different  physical  and virtualized  resources  are dynamically  allocated,  disassembled  and used to
meet the requirements  of customers.Resource  Pooling
+ The form of service (storage,  processing,  bandwidth,  active user account)  is summarized  and
resources  are automatically  adjusted  for use.
+ The amount  of resources  used is monitored  and controlled.  The findings  are then reported  in a
transparent  process  to the service provider  and the service usersMeasured  Service
Cloud computing  has a direct and interactive  relationship  with the IT sector, which encompasses  networks,  hardware,
solutions,  and applications.  The stakeholders  of cloud computing  can be divided into three main groups. In the first
group are vendors  who provide hardware,  solutions,  and applications  to cloud service providers.  In the second group
are providers  that provide cloud services  to users and some global leading companies  are Amazon,  sales force
dotcom,  and Google.  Third, there are various users such as individual  users or corporate  users, those that actually
use cloud services.  Users can rent as much services  as they need and they can scale up their services  in real-time  in
response  to increased  service loads, support  real-time  scalability  based on service load. And they only have to pay as
much as they use.
