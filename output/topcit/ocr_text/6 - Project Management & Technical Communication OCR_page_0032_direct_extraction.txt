01 Concept  and Types of Business  Documents
A) Concept  of business  documents
Business  documents  refer to all types of documents  necessary  for business  activities  such as process  planning
documents,  business  reports, meeting  minutes,  results and status reports. Unlike general documents,  these
business  documents  must be accurately  described  in a standardized  form so that they are not misleading.  In
addition,  it should be written with concise phrases  and objective expressions, excluding  lengthy phrases  and
emotional  expressions,  so that the person  who receives  the report can understand  it intuitively.
B) Types of business  documents
@ Types of Business  Documents
The types of business  documents  vary according  to the content  of work as follows,  and reports,  proposals,  and
business  plans are used the most.
+ Report: A document  to be prepared  for reporting  on the business  feasibility  of a product  or idea or business
environment  related  to it.
+ Letter: A document  used to evaluate  the value of a product  or idea
+ Proposal:  A document  to obtain approval  for business  promotion  of a product  or idea
+ Plan: A document  to prepare  a commercialization  plan after approval  of a product  or idea
+ Manual:  A document  explaining  the details of the plan/product
@ Types of Report
A report refers to a document  to logically  explain or persuade  a business  plan and progress.  Depending  on the
nature of the report, the report can be divided into a report that describes  the situation  and a report that
seeks judgment.  The former  develops  an idea based on the 5WIH principle  from an  objective  standpoint,  and
prioritizes  speed and accuracy  (e.g,, status report, situation  report, etc.) In the latter case, it is important  to
develop  an idea according  to a logical table of contents  from the perspective  of the person being reported  to,
and to clearly present  the logic and reason (e.g., plan report, countermeasure  report, etc.).
In addition,  it can be classified  according  to the purpose.  Reports made during the planning  process,  such
as planning  reports, are called information  reports, and reports made during the control process,  such as
inspection  results reports,  are called management  reports.
02 Principles  of Writing  Business  Documents
@ Easy to understand  from the perspective  of the end consumer
When creating  a business  document,  make it understandable  and relatable,  not from your own standpoint,  but
from the standpoint  of the reader or final decision  maker. Documents  should be prepared in a way that the
end-user  can understand  and relate to it by comprehensively  considering  the knowledge  level, experience,  and
needs of the end-user.  The end consumer  may be the management  or the ordinary  member  of an organization.
