B) Interpreter  languages
Interpreter  languages  convert  a source program into a low-level  language  directly, without  requiring  any
intermediate  steps, and execute  the program at the same time. Machine  language  programs  are not created
by translating  high-level  languages  into intermediate  codes and then executing  the translated  codes with a
software  interpreter;  rather, such programs  are executed  by calling sub-routines  corresponding  to the functions
of each intermediate  code. LISP and PROLOG  are representative  interpreter  languages.

@ Strengths  of interpreter  languages
+ Programs  are executed  if needed,  without  waiting  for complete  machine  language  translation.
+ Memory  can be saved as the source language  form is maintained  until the program  has been fully executed.
@ Shortcomings  of interpreter  languages
+ The source program  has to be decoded  whenever  it is executed  again, which takes time.
C) Compiler  languages
“Compilation”  means  converting  a specific  language  into another  language  having an equivalent  meaning.
The compiler  translates  a high-level  language  into a machine  language,  which is a low-level  language,  in order
to make an object module,  after which this module is linked, loaded, and executed.  FORTRAN,  PASCAL,  and C/
C are representative  compiler  languages.
