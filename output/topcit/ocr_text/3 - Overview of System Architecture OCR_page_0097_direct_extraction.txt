[Figure 70] Image Data Transformation  Process
Video data is composed  of several  frames.  Since each frame is an image, a video file requires  a high transmission  rate.
Video data can be compressed  with a spatial compression  or a temporal  compression  method.  JPEG performs  spatial
compression  of each frame, and each frame is compressed  independently.  Temporal  compression  removes  redundant
frames and configures each frame into I-frames,  which are independent  frames, B-frames,  and P-frames,  which
reference  other I-frames  to compress  data temporally.
Analog  audio signals  are digitized  using an analog-to-digital  converter  (ADC), and the ADC consists  of two processes:
sampling  and quantization.
@ Video compression  standard
The Moving Picture Experts  Group (MPEG) is an international  standardization  organization.  The official name of the
standard  is ISO/IEC  JTC1/SC29/WG11.  MPEG created  the following  compression  formats  and additional  standards.
