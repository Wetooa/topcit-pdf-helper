the requirements  and criteria for delivery.  Examples  of official inspection  include Review  and Walkthrough.
© Scope Controlling
It is the process  of monitoring  project status and product range and managing  them according  to formal
procedures.
It makes sure that requested  changes,  recommended  corrective  actions, and preventive  actions are processed
throughout  the project. Requests  for changes  to the baseline scope made through scope definition  in the
project  design and analysis  stage are frequent  in practice.  Since scope changes  are closely  related to schedule
and cost, they should be reported  to the Project Change Control Board (CCB), reviewed for their impacts
throughout  the project, and approved  and processed  according  to formal procedures.
O02 Scope Management  Technique
A) Work breakdown  structure  (WBS)
A work breakdown  system is created, in general,  for scope management.  In order to desgin work breakdown
system, customer  requirements  must be collected,  and the requirements  definition  document  must be pre-
pared.
Requirements  are generally  gathered  in the following  ways.
<Table 36> Scope Management  Techniques
Technique Explanation
Interview + A systematic  approach  to derive requirements  through  an oral interview  with individuals  and groups
Prototyping+ A technique  to promptly  and schematically  build a system  to be developed  in full or part
+ Prototyping  is better than specification  to enhance  the understanding  of and feedback  from users
Moderator
meeting+ A technique  to generate  ideas for specific  products,  services  and opportunities  for improvement
+ The moderator  ensures  to achieve  intended  goals by faithfully  implementing  the pre-defined  contents
for specific  issues when conducting  group discussions
Document
analysis+ A technique  to derive system requirements  by examining  documents  and related data on the existing
system
+ Analysis  of business  plans, market  research  results,  contract  details, RFP, SOW, related records,
existing  business  guides/procedures,  training  materials,  documents  related to similar products,  problem
reports,  customer  proposal  records,  and existing  system  design  documents
@ Concept  of Work Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)
The work breakdown  system is a hierarchical  structure  of tasks that are classified  based on project  deliverables
and broken down into manageable  packages.  Each subtask  item in the work breakdown  system  is called a
work package.  For example,  a project that creates an online bulletin board can be divided into work packages
of “Writing”,  “Deleting”,  “Editing”,  and “Uploading”.  The following  is an example of WBS created by Microsoft
Project.
