The most important  thing when providing  an IT business  service is the quality of that service. Quality
comes from the customer's  eye level, that is, the customer's  requirement  level. Therefore,  if you want to
provide an IT business  service, it is imperative  to understand  precisely  what the customer's  requirements
are.
IT business  services  are intricately  intertwined.  There are customers  who buy from the company  to
which one belongs,  and there are also partner  companies  (suppliers)  who do business  with the company.
Sometimes  partner  companies  can be important  customers.  As a result, the many stakeholders  in the value
chain must be linked to the company’s  solution,  making it absolutely  necessary  to conduct  an integrated
analysis.
In the past, the operations  of systems  for delivering  IT business  services  were fragmented.  However,  in
recent years the trend has switched  towards  operating  the cycle of “purchase-production-sales-post
management”  as a single connected  process.
Consequently,  because  the quality of a service from the suppliers  is virtually  equivalent  to the quality of
service from one’s own company,  continuous  quality control is something  that is required  from the very
beginning  to the very end of a service.  For this purpose,  the flow of information  between  the general-
purpose  systems  (which function  like the “blood vessels”  of the organization)  within a company  must be
managed  in a systematic  manner.
