01 Concept  of Cost Management
A) Concept  of cost
Price is the amount  of money the client pays in exchange  for the supplier's  provision  of a product  or service
in a business  relationship  and is determined  by business  judgment  between  the client and the supplier.  On the
other hand, cost is the monetary  value of resources  invested  in the production  of a product  or service and is
determined  by the production  capacity  of the supplier.
For reference,  cost is often translated as expense.  In other words, they can be distinguished  by how the loss
and profit from the project execution  are measured.  Cost is mainly used when the profit and loss measure-
ment is based on an individual  product  or service, while expense  is based on the period. (Example:  Product
Cost, Period Cost)
B) Importance  of cost management
A project  undergoes  formal approval  and allocation  of planned  resources  and budget. If the budget  is exceed-
ed due to poor cost management,  it must be reported  to the project  approver  (sponsor)  or the management
board. The cause of cost overrun  is due to mismanagement  of the scope or schedule.  If the scope is expand-
ed or the schedule is delayed,  the cost is exceeded  because  resources  must be put in to comply with the
schedule.  In other words, good cost management  means that appropriate  project costs are estimated  at the
beginning  and scope and schedule  management  are performed  well throughout  the project.
C) Concept  of cost management
Project  cost management  is a set of activities  to plan, calculate,  procure,  manage,  and control the budget so
that the project  can eventually  be completed  within the approved  budget.
O2 Concept  of Cost Management
Cost management  process includes  project cost management  planning,  cost estimation,  budgeting,  and cost
control.
A) Cost management  planning
Cost management  planning  is a task of establishing  and determining  cost management  methods  during the
life cycle of  a project. It is a process that includes  various cost estimation  techniques  from estimating  the
budget  required  to complete  the project, identifying  responsibilities  for each person in charge  of cost manage-
ment, to predicting  costs based on all information  related  to the project  at a given point in time.
B) Cost estimation
Project cost estimation  is a process  for developing  an estimate  of the monetary  resources  required  to com-
plete the project. Cost estimation  methods  are as follows:
