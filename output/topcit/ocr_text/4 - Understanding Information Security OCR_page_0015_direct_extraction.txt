@ Non-repudiation  of delivery
Non-repudiation  of delivery  refers to the prevention  of the receiver's  claim that the message  was not delivered
after actually  sending  the message.
® Non-repudiation  of receipt
Non-repudiation  of receipt refers to the prevention  of the receiver's  claim that the message  was not received
after actually  receiving  the message.
C) Cryptography
Cryptography  is largely  classified  into cryptographic  techniques  and encryption  protocol  techniques.
@® Cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  can be divided into the symmetric  key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption
key and the decryption  key are the samewhile  in the public key cryptosystem,  the encryption  key and the
decryption  key are different,  depending  on whether  the encryption  key and the decryption  key are the same.
@® Cryptographic  protocols
Cryptographic  protocols  refer to the protocols  that use cryptographic  techniques.  As a protocol  means a series
of finite phases  where more than 2 persons  participate  to achieve  a certain purpose,  the cryptographic  protocol
should prevent  repudiation  by a participant,  or a third party, to ensure a certain purpose  of the concerned
cryptographic  protocol  (authentication,  confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  etc.), as well as the meaning
of each message.
D) Digital signature
A digital signature  is the method  of providing  both data integrity  and signature  authentication,  by performing
a hash operation  on a specific document,  using the signature’s  private key. Signing  the entire message  is very
inefficient  because  the public key operation  should be performed  on all message  blocks repetitively.  Therefore,
an electronic  signature  can be efficiently  generated  by calculating  a hash value for the message,  then signing
on that value. Although  the signature  is on the hash value, instead  of on the message  itself, it is recognized  as
a genuine  signature  for the message  because  finding  another  message  with the same hash value is difficult.
E) Hash function
A hash function,  or hash algorithm,  is a mathematical  function that converts  a random string of various  sizes
into a short hash value (hash code) of fixed length, then outputs  it. That is, the function compresses  an input
string of a random length into a string with a fixed, short length.
Unlike an encryption  algorithm,  the hash function  does not use a key, therefore  providing  the same output  for
the same input. Thanks to this property,  the hash function  can be used for integrity  verification,  which can
detect an erroneous  or altered input message.
F) Malware
Malware  is an abbreviation of malicious  software  and refers to software  designed  to perform  malicious  actions
