Alibaba,  a Chinese  e-commerce  company,  was listed on the New York Stock Exchange  on the morning  of
September  19, 2014. What's amazing  about Alibaba is that on the day of its listing, its stock price rose by
38 percent  to $231.4 billion (241.6 trillion won) in market  value, and Jack Ma, Alibaba’s  largest  shareholder,
quickly  became  China's  richest  man, with $25 billion (26 trillion won) in assets.
In 1999, Jack Ma, along with seventeen  friends,  founded  Alibaba,  an online shopping  mall that sells Chinese |
SME products  to companies  around the world from his apartment.  Alibaba’s  rapid growth began in 2000
with a $20 million investment  from Softbank's  Masayoshi  Son. Following  in the footsteps  of Alibaba a B2B
service,  the company  launched  "Taobao,"  an online shopping  mall for individuals  (C2C), “tmall.com’  an online
department  store for wealthy  customers,  and "Alipay,  an electronic  payment  service.  Today, Alibaba Group
has become  the world’s leading  online shopping  mall and fintech corporation.  Alibaba is also one of the
finest models  of success  in the IT business.  So what is the key success  factor (CSF) that has enabled  the
company  to out-maneuver  eBay, the global company  that previously  occupied  the dominant  position  in the
Chinese  market?
First, there are no transaction  fees at Alibaba's  online shopping  mall. Profits are generated  from advertising |
and search services,  Second,  the company  deployed  an innovative  logistics  system that can deliver  goods
to any address  in the vast Chinese  territory  in just 1~2 days, and, using the ‘Alipay’  service,  it tured China's
unreliable  e-commerce  into a trading channel trusted by the trading parties.  Third, it worked aggressively
to meet customer  requirements.  It supported  the practice  of ‘chat-purchase’  when shopping  through  the
Internet,  whereby  customers  can negotiate  the price of a product  by chatting  before making a purchase
decision.  Fourth, CEO Ma Yun's vision and strategy  inspired his employees  to dedicate  themselves  to the
company  and drove them to work with all they have got.
As we saw earlier, Alibaba provides  the three elements  of competitiveness  that all companies  must have:
price, quality, and customer-friendly  services.  And, most importantly,  the organization  is very well led by the
CEO thanks to his vision and strategy. Alibaba is a perfect  example  of why strategy  is so important  in the
IT business,
