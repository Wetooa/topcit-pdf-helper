* Preview  for practical  business Why database  recovery  is necessary
It has been reported  that IT-related  losses accounted  for 16% (approximately  USD  7 billion)  of the
total financial  losses sustained  during the 09.11 WTC attack in New York, even though there were also
numerous  casualties.  Some enterprises  suffered  serious  damages  due to the loss of data and subsequently
experienced  difficulty  resuming  their online work because  it took a couple of days to recover  the lost data.
As such, if the duplicated  data and archives  of a business  system are not available,  damages  can be caused
not only by simple system shutdown  but also by the loss of the most important  information  essential  to
the survival  of the company  in an instant.  In fact, the incident  served as a timely reminder  for all enterprises
of the overriding  importance  of database  backup and recovery,  and led many enterprises  to adopt a
disaster  recovery  system,  which is a non-disruptive  recovery  system.
Although  they may not be the result of a terrorist  attack as in the above example,  failures  frequently
occur in the field, which cannot  ensure transaction  atomicity  and durability  due to various reasons  such as
hardware  failure (e.g. broken hard drive), power outage, DBMS software  defects, and so forth. Therefore,
all database  systems  need a method  of maintaining  the atomicity  and persistence  of transactions.  The
recovery  techniques  used to restore a system to its previous  state after the occurrence  of a database
failure (consistent  state) should ensure high availability  so that service downtime  caused by the failure of
the database  can be minimized.
