Overview  of System Architecture )
general,  an embedded  system's  overall structure  is intentionally  simplified  to reduce cost, compared  to the hardware
of general-purpose  computer  systems.  For example,  embedded  systems  often use peripherals  controlled  by a serial
bus that is 1024 times slower  than the conventional  peripheral  interfaces  that are used in personal  computers.
@ Resource  constraints
Programs  on embedded  systems  usually  operate  with real-time  constraints  on limited hardware  resources.  There is
often no disk drive, operating  system,  keyboard,  or screen on the system.  It may not have a file system,  or it may use
a flash drive as a storage  medium.  Even if there is a user interface,  it could be a small keypad  or LCD.
@ Stability
Embedded  systems  are designed  to run reliably, without error, for many years. Therefore,  firmware  goes through
a more careful development  and testing process  than the software  used in personal  computers.  Most embedded
systems  avoid the use of parts damaged  by mechanical  actions,  such as disk drives, switches,  and buttons.  Instead,
they use chip materials  that are relatively  free from physical  damage,  such as flash memory.
© Resilience
Embedded  systems  may be applied in places  where it is difficult  for humans  to immediately  and directly  control, such
as oil boreholes  and outer space. Therefore,  an embedded  system must be able to restart itself, even in the worst-
case scenario,  An electronic  part, called a watchdog  timer, enables  such an emergency  recovery.
C) Embedded  system  development  process
An embedded  system is developed  by the procedure,  shown in [Figure 72]. Unlike conventional  information  system
development,  it includes  a hardware  development  process.
5 Watchdog  Timer (WDT): An electronic  timer used to detect and recover  computer  failure. Computers  in normal operation  restart  the
watchdog  timer periodically  to prevent  a timeout.
