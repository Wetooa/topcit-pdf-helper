The important  thing in writing a technical  document  is that the expert or scientist  who writes it effectively
communicates  his or her ideas and research  results to readers (the general public). The content  must be
communicated  clearly and efficiently,  and since the time and effort invested  in writing these documents  is
very important  and valuable,  effective  writing skills for research,  performance  and achievements in one's
professional  field are required.
