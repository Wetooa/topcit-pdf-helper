In order to calculate  the schedule  by hand using the critical path method,  the activity  is expressed  as follows.
Activity  Name
The following  is an example  of calculating  a schedule  using the critical path method.  The critical path method
will be described  in detail through  the example  below.
<Table 43> Critical Path Method  (Example)
Activity  Name Duration Predecessor  Activity
A 3 days
B 2 days A
Cc 2 days B,D
D 4 days A
E 6 days D
F 3 days GE
@ Activity  Definition,  Duration  Estimation
If the activities  of the project are defined and the duration  of each activity is estimated,  the activities  are
linked according  to the sequential  relationship  as follows. Arrange  the identified  activities  according  to the
sequential  relationship  and enter the activity  name and duration.

[Figure 30] Critical Path Method@  (Example)
In the case of the activity  name “B’, it is placed after the activity  “A” because  the Predecessor  Activity  is “A”, and the
duration  of the activity  “B’ is 2 days, so enter 2 in the “Duration”.  Likewise,  for all other activities,  predecessor  activities
are identified  and arranged  in order, and the duration  of the activity  is written  at the top of the activity  name.
