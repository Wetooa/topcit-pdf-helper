project manager,  developers,  designers,  and so forth. By understanding  the customer  requirements  quickly,
customers  can be induced  to participate  actively  using the use case technique,  the functional  requirements  of
the system can be determined  at the beginning  of the project, and the results can be documented.
The use case technique  identifies  stakeholders,  classifies  them into homogeneous  groups according  to their
roles, and classifies  them into an actor. Each actor has a different  view and use of the system. A use case,
which is the use of the system by an individual  actor, can be identified  based on this. A use case corresponds
to a “use example’  that shows for what use (purpose)  each actor uses the system. Each use case is a set of
scenarios  used by a particular  actor to accomplish  a certain  function  or task.
Scenarios  should be created for each use case. A scenario  represents  the flow and process of an event,
and can include information  exchanged  between  systems and actors, and the situation,  environment,  and
background,  etc. in which interactions  occur. The use case technique  is used to verify user requirements
because it represents  the interaction  between  the user and the system and can clearly express  what the
system  performs.
@ Information  modeling
Information  exchanged  between  actor and system can be found using the use case scenario.  Using the
information,  information  modeling  should be performed  to identify  the information  that should be saved and
managed  inside the system, and the result should be displayed  as a class diagram  of UML (Unified Modeling
Language).  By using information  modeling,  the basic classes required  in the system can be identified,  and
the correlation  between  classes can be found from the relationships  between  classes, and the properties  of
each class can be found. Generally,  a class diagram can be obtained  in this phase, which expresses classes,
properties  inside the classes,  and the relationships  between  the classes  only.
© Dynamic  modeling
In the previous  section, the properties  and relationships  of the classes, which constitute  the system, were
displayed  in the class diagram by performing  information  modeling.  Based on this, the method of performing
dynamic  analysis can be described  as follows. Dynamic  analysis is the process of finding the operations  of
classes by paying attention  to changes  to the state or operations  of the objects  constituting  the system, or
the interactions  between  objects.
UML identifies  interactions  between  objects using the sequence  diagram,  and then identifies  the operation  of
each class based on the identified  interactions.  It is common  to create a sequence  diagram  for each use case.
Use case scenarios  are created by regarding  a system as a black box, whereas  sequence  diagrams  further
expand use case scenarios  and represent  the process  of interaction  between  objects  inside the system.
© Functional  modeling
Sometimes,  various  functions  should be performed  to carry out an event (operation)  identified  by a sequence
diagram.  Internally,  these functions  contain  complex  logic, and can be expressed  as operations  in a function  on
a smaller scale. The activity  diagram can identify a potential  or new activity  by expressing  the various  logics
performed  within an operation  as an activity.  The activity  diagram  is used to accurately  understand  the process
of handling  events  in a class. The diagram  is used to understand  the complex  process  handling  procedure  or to
identify  the additional  operations  of a class.
