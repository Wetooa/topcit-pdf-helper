ll. Understanding  Types of Databases
>> Recent  trends and major issues
The “database”  was created  in the late 1960s to manage  and use data more efficiently  than the computer
environment  which used the file system in the early days. Since then, the basic model of database  has
evolved  continuously  into relational,  object-oriented,  and object relational  types of database,  having  started
as a network  model. Currently,  the object relational  model is the most widely used model in the market.
In addition,  the internal data model and the structure  of the database  were a matter of interest  in the
past. However,  the importance  of database  processing  performance  was highlighted with regard to the
processing  of large-scale  data, as the problem of performance  degradation became  increasingly  serious
due to the rapid increase  in the amount  of digital data. Accordingly,  the relevant  technology  has expanded
to include  new types of databases,  such as the column-type  database  which places emphasis  on database
performance  and scalability  rather  than data relations,  NoSQL,  etc.
