Here, “configuration”  generally  refers to the program  created in the process  of software development,  the
program  description  document,  data, etc. Software  configuration  management  is a management  technique
designed  to systematically  manage  various  deliverables  created in the software  development  process.  That is,
it manages  actions  related to the history  of all component  changes  that occur from the software  development
phase to the maintenance  phase.
The table below describes  common  problems  that occur when software  configuration  is not (properly)  managed.
