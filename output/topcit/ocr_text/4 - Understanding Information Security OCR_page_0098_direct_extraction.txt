security,  such as the firewall and intrusion  detection  system. In particular,  efforts should be made to
strengthen  access  control to the system, security  settings,  and account  management,  in order to
respond  to the hijacking  of system administrator's  rights or inappropriate  access of internal users to
information  security  resources.
