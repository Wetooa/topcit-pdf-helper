+ If the relationship  has its own attributes,  they are included  in the connected  entity or included by identifying  a
relationship  entity.
+ For your reference,  “physical  modeling’  refers to the process  of converting  an ERD into a table structure.
+ In general,  normalization  is performed  in the logical data modeling  phase, and denormalization  is performed  in the
physical  data modeling  phase.

D) Concept  of process  modeling
“Process  modeling”  refers to the task of finding missing  or unnecessary  tasks to satisfy the functions  required  by
the target system, by analyzing  a given task efficiently  within a specified  period of time, when analyzing  large and
complex  tasks. In addition, it is regarded  as most important  to develop a high-quality  system by classifying  the
analyzed  tasks systematically  and by designing  the menu of the target  system  and program  system.
+ When  a task is analyzed  using a methodology,  the task can be arranged  systematically  in order to find most of
missing  or unnecessary  tasks, which is helpful when creating  a data model.
+ The process hierarchy  diagram is a frequently  used process model; and the task process is subdivided  into the
function  area, function,  process,  and unit process  according  to the size of the task.
E) Concept  of correlation  modeling
Correlation  modeling  is a method  of analyzing  what is happening  (process)  to something  (data) that exists within the
task concerned  and what is affected  by which event, when developing  an information  system.
+ Correlation  modeling  is performed  by using the entity type identified  from data modeling  and the unit process
identified  from process  modeling.
+ Whether  or not data are generated  by the entity type and the unit process  can be verified using the CRUD matrix,
which enables  the developer  to verify the task for the data model and the process  model in the analysis  phase, and
which can be used to understand  the test and task data exchange  in the future development  phase.
