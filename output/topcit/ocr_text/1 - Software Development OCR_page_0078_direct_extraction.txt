@ Structural  patterns
+ Adapter  pattern
- Definition:  The programming  interface  of a class is changed  to that of another  class. This pattern can be
used to make irrelevant  classes  work together  in one program.
- Advantages:  A new class and its function  can be added easily.
+ Bridge pattern
- Definition:  The class interface  and implementation  contents  are separated,  thus enabling  the developer  to
change  or replace  the implementation  contents  without  having  to change  the code contents  of the client.
- Advantages:  Separation  of interface  and implementation.  Implemented  objects can be exchanged  and
configured  at runtime.  #ifdef~#endif  syntax can be replaced.
+ Composite  pattern
- Definition:  A pattern  that enables  the user to handle a specific  object and the objects  containing  a specific
