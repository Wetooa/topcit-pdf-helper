D) VoLTE (Voice over LTE)
VoLTE is a technology  that provides  data and voice through  the LTE network.  It provides  voice services  in the LTE
environment,  the next-generation  wireless  broadband  network  technology.
Although  VoLTE refers to the voice service domain, since LTE technology  is based on an all-IP- data-only  network,
the VoLTE service is implemented  in the form of digital data. Therefore,  it transmits  voice, text, video chat, and
multimedia  content  in the SIP, which is the main calling solution  for Internet  telephony  services.  It provides  voice and
text services,  which exist as data, through  the IMS (IP multimedia  subsystem)  architecture.
These VoLTE technology  solutions  were not implemented  flawlessly  at the beginning.  It was because  the LTE
infrastructure  was not yet fully equipped,  so voice services  could not be transmitted  over the WCDMA/GSM  networks
freely. The problem  was that while roaming  and interconnection  were required between  LTE and 3G networks  to
provide seamless  communication  services,  there was no standard  agreement  on roaming  and interconnection
between  new and old networks.  The following  two steps can be considered  to resolve  the problem.
Firstly, the circuit-switched  fallback solution establishes  calls, mainly over the WCDMA/GSM  circuit network,  and
LTE terminal  vendors  and mobile telecommunication  carriers perform minimal roaming.  However,  multimedia
communication  service is not implemented  at this stage.
Secondly,  if the coverage  is established  to some extent after the initial stage of LTE network  construction,  it evolves
into the stage of implementing  a multimedia  communication  service, through  an appropriate  solution,  such as 3GPP
MMTel (Multimedia  Telephony).
[Figure 145] shows how VoLTE services  are implemented  over 3G networks.
