To understand  disruptive  innovation,  one also has to understand  the meaning  of “sustaining  innovation’.  Sustaining
innovation  is the strategy  of continuously  improving  existing  products  to satisfy and retain key customers  in the
market, with the goal of providing  high value at a high price through  gradual improvement.  In contrast,  disruptive
innovation is the strategy  of targeting  niche markets  by creating  low-priced  but good-quality  products  through
simplified  functions  and enhanced  convenience.

In other words, the market targeted  by disruptive  innovation  is the overshot  customer7  base. This market has
emerged from the argument  that there is a limit to the performance  that customers  are willing to use or accept.
Overshot  customers  are not in favor of paying  for high-end  features  that they do not need.
There are two approaches  to introducing  disruptive  innovation:  low-end  disruption  and new market disruption.  Low-
end disruption  is the strategy  of entering  the low-end market by resolving  the product  complaints  of overshot
customers  and entering  the market  through low-priced  products  that perfectly  match the satisfaction  levels of the
customers.
