Recently,  services  using artificial intelligence  are proliferating.  Translation  services  such as Google Translator,  Baidu,
and NAVER  translator,  based on artificial  neural network  algorithms,  were launched  to help the general  public translate
languages  they do not understand.  Kakao's  flower  search, Naver's  smart lens, and Google lens are services  that utilize
the Al image classification  function  commonly  referred  to as "machine  vision." Furthermore,  there other Al-based
services  that could be used in everyday  life. For example,  there is a music service that recognizes  the music users
are listening  to and tells them the title of the song. Watermark  erase service removes  the watermark  imprinted  on
images,  and there is an auto draw service  which turns one’s painting  into an emoticon.
The very first definition  of artificial intelligence  was announced  by John McCarthy  and others at the 1956 Dartmouth
Conference  in the U.S. and he defined Al to be about “making  a machine  behave in ways that would be called
intelligent  if a human were so behaving.”  Today, artificial  intelligence  is understood  to be the method  of making
computers  or machines  mimic human intelligence  (cognition,  inference,  or learning)  or the technology  for researching
the feasibility  of doing so.
+ Artificial  intelligence  technology
A key characteristic  of artificial intelligence  technology  is its ability to reason, along with other characteristics  like
generality,  vastness,  inaccuracy,  and knowledge  use. In recent  years, the Al technology  receiving  most interest  has
been "pattern  recognition,’  "machine  learning,”  and "deep learning,”
+ Pattern  recognition
In artificial  intelligence,  pattern recognition  is the process  of separating  a set of learned data into a multitude  groups
based on a criteria of the entered  values. Pattern  recognition  has two stages:  leaming  and recognition.
In the learning  stage, key information  for distinguishing  patterns  is extracted.  For this purpose,  people analyze  the
characteristics  of patterns  using a given dataset.
Using the core information  of the patterns  found in the learning  stage, in the recognition  stage, the given data is
classified  and recognized  using the previously  recognized  pattem.
