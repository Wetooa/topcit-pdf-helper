Condition Description
Effectiveness All instructions  of the algorithm  should be basic and implementable.
B) Algorithm  analysis  criteria
@Correctness
The correct  result should be produced  for valid input by the algorithm  within a finite time.
@Amount  of work done:
The number  of instances  of execution  undertaken  to execute an algorithm;  The amount  of work done
should be measured  with important  operations  only that become  the core of the flow in the entire algorithm,
excluding  general  operations  included  by default.
@Amount  of space used:
An amount  of computer  memory  needed  to store data and information  while an algorithm  is being executed.
@  Optimality
The expression  “A certain algorithm  is optimal’ means that the algorithm  is the most appropriate  considering
the usage environment  (execution  times, memory  usage, etc.) of the system  that will apply the algorithm.
©Simplicity
Simplicity  means the clarity and ease of understanding  of an algorithmic  expression.  A simple algorithm  makes
it easy to prove an algorithm’s  accuracy  and to carry out program  writing and debugging.
C) Algorithm  expression  method
<Table 13> Algorithm  expression  method
Expression  method Description
Description  Chart An algorithm is expressed  using words or texts used in everyday life.
language
Flow chart An algorithm  is expressed  using graphical  representation,  such as a flow chart or NS (Nassi-
representation Shneiderman)  chart.
Peendorende An algorithm  is expressed  in a simpler  way than the natural  language  description  method  by using
code written in a form like programming  language.
D) Algorithm  performance  analysis
Algorithm  performance  is analyzed  by estimating  space complexity,  whereby  performance  is analyzed  in terms
of the space required  for execution,  and by estimating  time complexity,  whereby  performance  is analyzed  in
terms of the time required  for execution.
@ Space complexity
Space complexity  refers to the total amount  of storage space or memory  needed to execute  and complete  an
algorithm  using a program,  which can be calculated  by adding the amount  of fixed space and the amount  of
variable  space.
Space complexity  = Amount  of fixed space + Amount  of variable  space
+ Amount  of fixed space: Storage  space that is needed permanently,  regardless  of the program  size or number
of input/output  times, such as programs,  variables,  constants,  etc.
