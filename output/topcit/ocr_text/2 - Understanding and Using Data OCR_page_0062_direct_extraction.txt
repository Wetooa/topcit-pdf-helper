<Table 23> Classification  of identifiers
Classification Identifier Description
Primary A separator  that can distinguish  each occurrence  within an entity, and an identifier  that
Representa- identifier can connect  a reference  relationship  with other entities.
tiveness Alternate A separator  that can distinguish  each occurrence  within an entity, but which cannot
identifier connect  the reference  relationship  because  it has no representativeness.
ee An identifier  that is created by itself inside an entity.
Self-generation - - - , i -e Foreign An identifier  that is received from other entities based on the relationship  with other
identifier entities.
Single identifier  | An identifier  consisting  of one attribute.
Number  of Composite
attributes <omp An identifier  consisting  of more than two attributes.
identifier
Natural An identifier  created by work.Replacement identifier
status Artificial An identifier  that is not created  for work, but which is artificially  created because  the
identifier original identifier  has a complex  configuration.

|) Identifier  relationship  and non-identifier  relationship
A foreign  identifier  is an attribute  created  in a child entity through  its relationship  with other entities,  not an attribute
needed by a given entity itself The foreign identifier  acts as a foreign key when creating  a database.  The foreign
identifier  can be naturally  identified  by a logical relationship  when the relationship  and attribute,  as well as the primary
identifier,  are defined.  When a primary identifier  is assigned  to an entity and  a relationship  between  the entities is
established,  the child entity's  attributes  are inherited  from the parent’s  primary  identifier.  At this time, it should be
determined  whether  the child entity will use the foreign identifier  received  from the parent  identity  as its own primary
identifier  or not, or whether  it will use it only as a property  that is connected  to the parent.
