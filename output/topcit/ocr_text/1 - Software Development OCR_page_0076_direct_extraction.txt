@ Object  creation  patterns
+ Abstract  Factory  pattern
Definition:  When creating  a family of objects  that are either closely related or hardly related, an interface  is
provided  that can create the object  concerned  without  specifically  knowing  its class.
- Advantages:  Applied when creating  a specific  object and actually  using it without  specifically  knowing  the
type of object to which the client codes belong.
A new product family can be added independently  of the existing  source codes when creating  a new
product  family.
- Disadvantages:  All factory  classes  should be modified  when adding  a new product  to the product  family.
- Use examples:  When developing  a compiler that should be configured  differently  for each system or
operating  system.
