technique  is provided  to resolve it. Each fragment  that has been divided and transmitted  is reassembled  in the SCTP
layer to become  one user message.
@ Acknowledgment  and congestion  avoidance
SCTP transmits  a data chunk by assigning  a TSN to it, regardless  of the stream.  The receiving  side separately  secures
the transmission  reliability  from the sequenced  stream transmission  by acknowledging  (ACK) all the received  TSNs.
Acknowledgment  and congestion  control  functions  are related  to packet retransmission  if an acknowledgment  is not
received  within a given time. Packet retransmission  is performed  according  to a congestion  avoidance  procedure,
similar  to TCP congestion  control.
© Chunk bundling
A chunk with multiple  user data or SCTP control information  may follow an SCTP packet's  common  header,  An SCTP
user can request  to bundle multiple user messages  in a single SCTP packet. The SCTP chunk bundling  function is
responsible  for assembling  multiple  chunks  into one SCTP packet  and decomposing  it.
© Packet  validation
The SCTP common  header  has a verification  tag (VT) and a 32-bit checksum  field. The VT is a value selected  at
each endpoint  when setting  up the association. During  the set association,  SCTP packets  must be transmitted  using
the same VT, and if an SCTP packet with a wrong VT is received,  it is discarded.  Moreover, generating  a CRC32c
checksum  and transmitting  the SCTP packet  prevents  data corruption  in the network.
@ Path management
The transmitting  SCTP user can use the path management  function  to manipulate  the transport  address,  SCTP port
number,  and IP address,  used in the SCTP packet  destination. When the association  is established,  the primary  path
of each SCTP endpoint  is defined and used to transmit  and receive SCTP packets. However,  if there is a problem
with the current path, and available  transmission address  among the addresses,  defined by multi-homing, can be
designated  as an alternative  path. The path management  and the packet  verification  that uses the VT and checksum
are performed  simultaneously.
SCTP packets  have a general  header  and set of blocks called chunks.  There are two types of chunks: control chunks
and data chunks.  Control  chunks  are delivered  before data chunks.
The general header  defines the endpoint  of each association  of the packet, guarantees  a packet belonging  to a
specific  association,  and preserves  the integrity  of the contents  of the packet, including  the header  itself

Type Description
Source  port no. + Same as TCP and UDP
Destination  port no. + Same as TCP and UDP
Verification  tag + Used as the identifier  for the association  and repeated  in all packets  during  the association.
@réem + The  size of a checksum  is 32 bits to enable CRC-32  checksums.
