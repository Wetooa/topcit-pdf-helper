+ As the number  of projects  and products  in need of development  increased  and became  more difficult  to manage,  it
became  necessary  to consolidate  the scattered  information.
+ Included  in the centralized  system were a number  of items that served as important  reference  data when designing
items and products;  such as BOM (bill of materials)  management,  development  process standardization,  and the
workflow-based  change management  function,  etc. The inclusion  of these items made it possible  to maximize  the
efficiency  of product  development.
+ Recently,  the trend among  companies  has gravitated  towards  consolidating  the PLM through  the integration  of ERP
and MDM solutions  for the purpose  of managing  the reference  data from the enterprise-wide  perspective.  In the
future, PLM will be expanded  to include  the social PLM area by linking it with external  data.
03 IT Business  Decision-Making  Support  System
In order for an enterprise  to make a business  decision,  it has to have access to internal/external  information, as the
collection,  analysis and processing  of such information  is critical to making a rational decision.  Data generated  by a
general-purpose  work support  system are simply too voluminous  to be analyzed  by hand in the expectation  that
some meaningful  implications  could be derived from them. In particular,  there are many times when decisions  have
to be made within  a limited  timeframe:  and, in recent years, the fast changing  nature of business  environments  has
led to rising uncertainties,  which has in turn forced companies  to frequently  conduct  complex  analyses,  increasing  the
demand  for systems  capable  of supporting  decision  making.
The two leading information  systems  that provide such support  to enterprises  are the decision-making  support
system and the business  intelligence  system.  The decision-making  support  system is used when making make
decisions  that require a quantitative  analysis,  such as an analysis  of a company’s  return on investment  and its break-
even points. Meanwhile,  business intelligence  systems  enable companies  to respond with agility by monitoring  the
business  operating  environment  and detecting  changes  through  the discovery,  extraction,  and analysis of business
data.
Before looking  at the two systems,  let's start with the concept  of the enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW), an enterprise
data repository  that underpins  enterprise  data analytics.
A) Understanding  EDW
@ Definition  of EDW
The enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW) is a system that can address,  by subject  matter, information  analysis  requests
by users, through  the integration  of internal and external  data. The EDW requires  the construction  of infrastructure
that serves as the backbone  of enterprise  data. This infrastructure  touches  every area and aspect  of an enterprise’s
business.
+ In the beginning,  the EDW mostly  encompassed  the internal  data of an enterprise.  Today, however,  it is evolving  into
a forecasting  system  that integrates  both the internal and external  information  of an enterprise.
