01 Data Structure
A) Definition
A data structure  is a method  of storing  data in the memory  device  of a computer.  It defines  data systematically
so that various data can be efficiently  expressed  and utilized, considering  the characteristics  and usages of
data.
B) Classification
The data structure  can be broadly divided into linear and non-linear  structures.  The linear structure  is a
method  of organizing  data in such a way that they are connected  in a row, whereas,  in the non-linear  structure,
data have a special form such as a hierarchical  structure.
<Table  8> Classification  of data structures
Classification Description
Data are arranged  in a straight  line by considering  the sequence  of the data. Data are arranged  in a
Linear  structure one-to-one  relationship  between  data and before/after,  adjacent  to, previous/next  data.
The types of linear structure  include  array, linear list, linked list, stack, queue, and dequeue.
It is a structure  in which several data exist after one data. Data adjacent/before  and after data are
Non-linear  structure arranged  in a one-to-many  or many-to-many  relationship.
The types of non-linear  structure  include  tree and graph.
