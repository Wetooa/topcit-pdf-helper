0S Management  of the Key Performance  Indicators
A) Overview  of KPI
KPI stands for key performance  indicator  and is a quantifiable  indicator  that contains  the critical success  factor (CSF)
of an organization.  The KPI is used to measure  the achievement  of a goal. Therefore,  KPIs must accurately  reflect
the goals of the organization  and they must be selected  from among  the elements  that are critical to realizing  those
goals, KPls are the factors  (means  or determinants)  that could determine  victory  in competition  as well as the factors
(ends or results)  related to the success  of the selected  strategy.  Generally  set by the organization  and its employees,
KPls are important  indicators  that are widely used in performance  evaluations.  Therefore,  depending  on which KPIs are
selected,  the employees  could start behaving  differently  at work.
B) KPI establishment  procedure
The right KPIs should be compatible  with the vision and objectives  of the organization,  should  function  as strategic
drivers,  and should allow the members  of the organization  to move forward  in accordance  with the same purpose  and
strategy.  Therefore,  KPls should be able to provide  guidance  for the entire organization,  and should not be limited to
specific  areas. The derived KPls should be made to match the strategy  and goals of the organization  after undergoing
a validation  process.
