03 Types of ER Notations
In 1976, Peter Chen created a form of notation for data models called an entity-relationship  model (ER model).
This notation  uses a rectangle,  a diamond,  and an ellipse to represent  an entity, a relationship,  and an attribute
respectively.  This notation  is widely used when learning  theories  about data modeling.  The main college courses  in
Korea use Chen’s model of notation  when teaching  database  design. The following  section describes  the various
notations  used to denote  entities, properties,  and relationships.
Chen - Used with many college
