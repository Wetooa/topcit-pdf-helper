Overview  of System Architecture )
- Hardware  team: Manufactures  the PWB using the artwork.
- PWB:
Making  the PWB A circuit board is made by melting  other parts with chemicals  and the necessary
(printed  wiring board) parts using a copper  disk. A machine  uses artwork  data to draw the circuit on the
‘ PWB
and integrating board and make the PWB.
modules - Software team: Integrates  modules.
(For example,  embedded  Linux software  integrates  the bootloader,  Linux kernel, and
apps.)
- Hardware  team: Mounts  parts like the CPU and memory  on the PWB.
- Software  team: Tests if the actual hardware  operates  as intended.
Part mounting  and rn . . .
hardware  testing (Since it is not realistic  to test all designed  and completed  codes, a test program  is Test results
made to check the normal  operation  of hardware  parts on the PCB, each CPU port,
the memory  unit, and I/O devices.)
- Installation  of software  on hardware
(Hardware  power  supply  > Bootloader  execution  Bootloader  OS execution  > OS
performs  intended  action, according  to the system  input value.)
- Solving  the identified  problem  until the mass production
- Establishing  countermeasures  to unexpected  problems,  such as the increasing  part
defect  rate and part termination
- Conducted  after functional  stabilization  (six months  before  the mass-production
testing)
- Conducted  in various  environments  (high temperature/high  humidity  and sub-zero
environments)  for about six months  — For worldwide  export
- EMI: Inspection  of the interference  of the electromagnetic  wave on other electronic

EMI and safety - The designer  includes the EMI Team data in the debugging  circuit during the
integrated  testing  and debugging  for EMI debugging.

02 Embedded  Hardware
A) Microprocessor,  the key to embedded  systems
An embedded  system can handle more functions  and performance  because  the processor  provides  the performance
required  to drive the device. Early microprocessor  units (IMPUs) were made in a single chip, in which registers  data
processing,  arithmetic  logic unit (ALU) for mathematical  operation,  and flags for storing  result values were integrated
into a chip. Although  CPU and MPU were separated  according  to use and purpose in the past, the boundaries  now
are somewhat  ambiguous.  Since then, microcontrollers,  with a built-in processor,  memory,  and control interface  on a
single chip, have emerged  to be used for real-time  operating  systems  or automatic  controls.
It is not far-fetched  to consider  that the MPU is included in all the electronic  devices that are open to user
intervention  in its use or configuration.  It is currently  used in smartphones,  smart bands, and tablet PCs that are used
