[Figure 36] Types of Functions
The calculation  process  of the function  point method  is as follows:
@ Determine  the Type of Count
+ Choose  among Development  Project  / Enhancement  Project/  Application  FP count
@ Identify  Scope and Boundary  of the Count
+ Determine  the full scope of software
+ Separate  the boundaries  of individual  applications
© Measure  Data Functions
+ Identify  the internal logical files (ILF) and the external  interface  files (EIF), determine  complexity  and
contribution,  respectively,  to derive data function  points
* Complexity  and contribution are determined  by dividing  into Data Element  Types (DET) and Record Element
Types (RET). DET is calculated  as the number  of attributes  and RET is calculated  as the number  of subgroups.
@ Transaction  function  measurement
+ Identify  units of activity,  separate  El (External  Input), EO (External  Output),  and EQ (External  Query) for each
unit of activity, and then determine  the complexity  and contribution,  respectively,  to derive transaction
function  points
* Complexity  and contribution  are determined  by dividing into data element  types (DET) and file transfer
reference  types (FTR).
© Determination  of Unadjusted  Function  Points
+ Unadjusted  function  points are the sum of data function  points and transaction  function  points.
© Determination  of Value Adjustment  Factor
+ Total Degree of Influence  (TDI) is calculated  by determining  and summing  the values of 14 General System
Characteristics  (GSCs)  weighted  on a scale from 0 to 5
+ The 14 GSCs are: Data communications,  Distributed  data processing,  Performance,  Heavily  used configuration,
Transaction  rate, On-Line  data entry, End-user  efficiency,  On-Line  update, Complex  processing,  Reusability,
Installation  ease, Operational  ease, Multiple  sites, Facilitate  change.
+ Value Adjustment  Factor  (VAF) = (TDI * 0.01) + 0.65
