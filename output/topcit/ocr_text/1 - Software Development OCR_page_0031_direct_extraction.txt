ESSENCE
implementing  user stories using the planning  poker.
+ Empirical  model: Scrum has its own process  model, but many techniques  place emphasis  on the experience  of
the individuals  participating  in the project. As each project  has its own intrinsic  situation  and characteristics,
it is difficult  to understand  the project  situation  using the existing  standardized  process.  Scrum accepts  that
something  can actually  be different  for each team even though  the basic structure  is the same.
