03 File Transfer  Protocol
FTP is a protocol  for transferring  a file, or part of a file, from one system to another  [1]. Unlike other application layer
protocols,  FTP has two connections.  They are control connection  and data connection,  which use ports 21 and 20,
respectively.  The control connection  is maintained  until the client or FTP session is terminated.  The data connection
establishes  a TCP connection  when a file transfer  starts. The data port number  can be a number, other than 20,
depending  on the method  used.
FTP connection  is largely divided  into general  transfer  mode and passive  transfer  mode (PASV). The general  transfer
mode requests  a connection  to a client to establish  a data connection,  and a problem  occurs when it connects  with
an external  server system through a system, such as a firewall.  In contrast,  the client first requests  a connection
to the server  through a channel other than the basic data channel in the passive transfer  mode. Since the client
requests  to establish  an FTP connection, it can pass through  the firewall without  a problem.  It is applicable,  even
when the client's IP is not visible from the outside  because  the client network  uses a proxy server.
