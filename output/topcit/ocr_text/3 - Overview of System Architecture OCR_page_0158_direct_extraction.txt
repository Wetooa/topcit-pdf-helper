[Figure 112] Router  Conceptual  Diagram
The above sections  described  the network  layer operation  and related scenarios,  as shown in [Figure 112].
(52) Information  created  by the TCP protocol  is capsulized  in order to be routed to the 220.17.23.0
network,  in which my.server.com  is present,  through  several hops (IP).
An initial packet that contains  the information  for routing between  networks  is created.
However,  it must be further  modified  to be transferred  between  networks.  The IPv4 address  of
user A’s computer  is 192.168.11.5  and cannot  be transmitted  to my.server.com  directly.  It must
be transmitted  to the computer's  gateway  wired/wireless  router B (192.168.11.1).  However,  an
IP address  cannot  be used for data transfer  in a network,  so the MAC address  is needed.  After
finding  the MAC address  that corresponds  to 192.168.11.1,  the gateway’s  IP address,  the packet
is transmitted  to wired/wireless  router B, through  network  broadcasting.
Upon receiving  the packet  from user A’s computer,  wired/wireless  router B, aware that the
packet  is not sent to the router  as the final destination,  examines  to which address  the packet
must be transmitted.  The IP header  indicates  that the packet's  final destination  is my.server.
com, and since it does not belong  to network  192.168.11.0  or 14.32.172.0,  to which wired/
wireless  router  B belongs,  it transmits  the packet  to router  C, to which it belongs.
Upon receiving  the packet, my.server.com  examines  the IP address  and recognizes  that
the packet was sent to it. It removes  the header  data, such as the IP address,  and sends the
remaining  data up to a higher layer.
