Overview  of System  Architecture
@ Massive  parallel  processor  (MPP)
MPP is a distributed memory  type in which each processor  has an independent  memory.  The loosely  coupled  system
exchanges  data between  processors  through  a network,  such as Ethernet.  The structure  of connecting  nodes, like
the CPU, memory,  and I/O device, each of which has its own system resources,  through  a network, offers excellent
scalability  and programming  difficulty.

@® Non uniform  memory  access (NUMA)
NUMA is a structure  the combines  the advantages  of the SMP, which is a shared memory  structure  that makes it
easier to develop  programs  and the MPP structure,  which offers excellent  scalability.  Each processor  has a separate
local memory  and the global memory  address  space that all processors  can access.

@ Instruction  pipelining
The technology  improves  the CPU performance  by dividing  an operation  into several stages and configuring  a
hardware  unit for processing  each stage separately  in order to process  different  instructions  simultaneously.  In other
words, it does not process  only one instruction at a time, but it processes  multiple  instructions  simultaneously  by
