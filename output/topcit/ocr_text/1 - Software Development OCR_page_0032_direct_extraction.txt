Software  Development
>> Recent  trends and major issues
We can see that enterprises  are increasingly  reusing their software  as their business  becomes
globalized.  Software  is reused to develop  and maintain  new features  using knowledge  proven in the
past. Many enterprises  are considering  how to increase  the reuse rate because  it is a highly  effective
means of reducing  costs through productivity  and quality improvements  thanks to reproduction  of
software  in a short period of time.
