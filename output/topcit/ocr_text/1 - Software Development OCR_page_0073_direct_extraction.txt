C) Inheritance
Each class has its own properties  and operations,  as well as properties  and operations  common  to several
other classes too. When there are similarities  between  classes, these similarities  can be collected to  define
a new class, which is called generalization.  For example,  the classes “professor”  and “student”  have common
properties  (e.g. resident  registration  number,  name, address,  phone number).  At this time, a generalized  class,
“people”,  can be defined  by combining  professors  and students.  In this case, “student”  and “professor”  are called
a subclass  of “people”,  and “people”  is the superclass  of student  and professor.
In this case, the superclass  “people”  has the common  properties  and operations  of the subclasses  “student”
and “professor’,  and the subclasses  “student”  and “professor’  have properties  and operations  that are not
shared between  subclasses.  Generalization  shows important  characteristics  wherein the superclass  displays
the common  properties  and operations of certain  subclasses,  and superclass  information  is inherited  by
subclasses.  Inheritance  through  generalization  enables  us to simplify  the definition of a class and create a new
class by using the pre-defined  class.
D) Polymorphism
One of the characteristics  of object-oriented  programming  is polymorphism.  Polymorphism  means that
operations  with the same name are performed  differently  depending  on the class, and means  that one function
name and one operator  can be used for multiple  purposes.  Polymorphism  in object-oriented  programming  is
mainly used in inheritance  relations  and provides  a degree  of flexibility  that allows subclasses  to respond  to one
operation  defined in the superclass  using their own unique method.  Polymorphism  is based on a concept  that
allows the superclass  to call the method  (a series of task sequences  to be executed  according  to the message)
of the subclass.  It is also classified  into “overriding”,  which redefines  the method defined by the superclass
in the subclass,  and “overloading”,  which defines multiple methods  using different  types of parameter  and
different  numbers  of parameters.
The sender  of the message  simply calls the operation  of the superclass  only and does not have to know the
type of object (subclass),  and the proper operation  of the subclass  is automatically  determined  according  to
the type at runtime. Determining  the operation  using the object of the subclass  at runtime  is called “run-time
binding”. Polymorphism  and run-time  binding  are essential  concepts  for understanding  design patterns.
03 Static Modeling  and Dynamic  Modeling
A) Static modeling
Static modeling  is based on the same concept  as the information  modeling  described  above. It is designed  to
reveal the static information  of an object  without  the intervention  of the concept  of time. Information  modeling
describes  the data by finding out the structure of  the database  used in the system. The information  model
finds the basic objects  required  by the system,  and is composed  of relationships  that indicate  the properties  of
the objects  and the relationships  between  those objects.
The class diagram  of UML is an information  model that shows the static information  structure  of a system.  It is
used to represent  the classes  required  for the system  and the relationships  between  them. Each class consists
