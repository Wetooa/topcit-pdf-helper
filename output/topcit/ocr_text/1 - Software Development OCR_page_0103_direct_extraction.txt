* Companies  recognize  testing as unnecessary  and as an additional  expense  rather than an
investment.
These days, however,  software  is gradually  crossing  over from the traditional  domain  and spreading  to
every sector (home appliances,  wireless  devices,  industrial  devices,  medical  devices,  etc.) through  the
loT, big data, mobile, and cloud. Enterprises  are increasingly  placing  greater  emphasis  on improving
the efficiency  of development  and operation  and recognizing  the importance  of software  quality. As
the users’ expectation  is rising, enterprises  need to run software  testing systematically,  resulting  in
higher investment,  the recruitment  of increasingly  professional  human resources,  the use of more
automated  tools and process  establishment.
