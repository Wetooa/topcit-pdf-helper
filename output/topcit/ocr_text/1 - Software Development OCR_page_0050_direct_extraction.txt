F) Search  algorithm
@ Search  algorithm  overview
This is a technique  that efficiently  finds the desired  item in the data set. It can be divided into linear search
and control search depending  on whether  data are sorted or not. There is also hashing,  which searches  for
data by calculating  a key value according  to a specific  function.  Therefore,  an optimal  search method should be
selected  in consideration  of the type of data structure  and the data arrangement  status.

<Table 17> Classification  of search  algorithms
Classification Data
method sort ‘Type Content  and characteristics
+ Amethod  of finding  a key by comparing  each record  sequentially  from start to finish.
+ Easy to write a program.
Linear  search x Linear search + Search  time increases  as much as the file size.
+ The simplest  and most direct search method
+ Average  number  of comparison  times: (n+1)/2,  average  search time: O(n)
+ Asearch  method  that sets the upper limit value (F) and the lower limit
value (L), finds the intermediate  value (M), and searches  by continuously
comparing  the key and the intermediate  value.
+ Efficient  as the number  of targets  in a file to search  is reduced  by half each time.
+ More effective  when the number  of records  is large. (The number  of
comparisons  even in the worst case is just one more than the average
number  of times.)
+ Average  search time: O(log2n)
+ Amethod  of searching  by creating  sub-files  using Fibonacci  permutations.
Fibonacci + Fibonacci  search is fast because  it can search by addition  and subtraction
search only, while binary search uses division.
+ Average  search time: O(log2n)
Control  search ° + Amethod  of selecting  and finding  a location  where the search target is
expected  to be present.  After finding  the location,  linear search is performed
from that location.
+ Interpolation  search  is used to search  dictionary,  phone book, or index name, etc.
+ Performance  of O(log(n))  on average
+ Asearch  method  that divides  entire data into a certain number  of blocks,
determines  a block that contains  the data to search,  and then sequentially
searches  for the key value in the selected  block.
+ The effective  block size is yn.
+ Easy to write and update  a program.
+ Performance  of O(log(n))  on average
Binary  tree + Search method  using a binary  tree

+ Suitable  for data that are frequently  inserted  and deleted.
