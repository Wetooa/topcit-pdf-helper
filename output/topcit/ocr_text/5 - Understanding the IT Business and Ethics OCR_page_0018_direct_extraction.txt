Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
To efficiently  plan and implement  an IT business and realize the benefits  of its implementation,  the concept  of IT
business  must first be clearly established.  Therefore,  this chapter  begins by explaining  the concept  of IT business
and how it has evolved.  Next, we will introduce  an IT ecosystem  made up of contents  (C), platform  (P), network  (N),
device (D), and security  (S) industries  that compete  and collaborate  with each other in the IT business  environment
(an environment  which is affected  by the new IT technology  hype curve) and the IT value chain produced  by the
ecosystem.
A) Definition  of IT business
IT business  refers to all activities  that are strategically  carried out by integrating  IT into a broad range of processes  to
realize  the business  objectives  of a company.
In the twentieth  century,  computers  were installed  mainly in computing  rooms and used only sparingly  in the ordinary
working  environment  of most businesses.  However,  since the 1990s, with the development  of computers  and the
mass adoption  of web technology,  the use of computers  has gradually  been extended  to the ordinary  working
environment.
This popularization  of computer  technology  accelerated  rapidly in the twenty-first  century  with the infiltration  of IT
into every corner of the national industries.  From this point on, the lifestyle  of the great majority  of people began to
transition  to one centered  on digital technologies,  and IT began to play a key role in the business  processes  of almost
all industries.  In other words, companies  were not utilizing  computers  only partially in the workplace; rather, IT began
to play a key role in companies’  decision-making  process  from an enterprise-wide  perspective.
Around 2005, the concept  of ‘IT business’  first began to be discussed  and recognized  in earnest  by people working
in the field, mainly  in industries  that sell products  where IT is critical. After 2010, as a growing  number  of companies
integrated  IT into their business  processes,  the concept  of IT business  evolved  into a structure  in which IT is tightly
merged  with business  processes  in order to give companies  a competitive  advantage.  In particular,  decision-makers
in the world of business  began to recognize  the importance  of fully incorporating  IT into their businesses  in order to
acquire high-quality  data in a rapidly changing  business  environment.  [Fig. 2] explains  how the concept  of IT business
has evolved  over the years.
