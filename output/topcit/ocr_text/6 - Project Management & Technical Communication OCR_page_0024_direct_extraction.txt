01 Business  Problem  Solving  Techniques
A) Concept  of business  problem  solving
In a business  environment,  problems  can be broadly  divided into two: planning  that creates  new opportunities:
and improvement  of internal processes.  Planning  can be said to be the process  of finding the “blue ocean’,
which is a business  opportunity,  and it is the process  of creating  a new market through a solution  that can
address  the current problems.  Improving  internal processes  is a task to more efficiently  execute  a current
market  opportunity.  When those two elements  are accurately  recognized,  defined and resolved,  it is possible
to ensure stable business  continuity  and to create new opportunities.  Therefore, it is most important  to solve
business  problems  through  optimal  problem-solving  processes  and business  thinking.

B) Business  problem  solving  process
The business  problem  solving process is to recognize  various  types of problems  that occur in the process  of
performing  work, understand  the process  from analyzing  and addressing  the problems,  and propose  new solu-
tions by appropriately  applying  the existing  problem  solving  methods  based on reasonable  grounds.
Problem  solving  techniques  are generally  presented  as follows.
