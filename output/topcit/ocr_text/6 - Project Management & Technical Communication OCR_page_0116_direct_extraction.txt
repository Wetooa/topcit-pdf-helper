Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
+ Preview  for practical business
Just as you frequently  checks for any abnormalities  in a car while driving a long distance,  a series of
quality control activities  are needed to ensure that the quality target is achieved  by checking  the
project  quality  level even when implementing  a project.
In general,  quality management  consists  of quality planning,  quality control, and quality assurance.
There is no significant  difference  in the overall composition,  but the quality management  of the
actual project is somewhat  different  from that of the manufacturing  industry.  For example,  if quality
control in manufacturing  is about product  quality, quality control of project can be seen as process
quality. This is due to the fact that the working  method differs depending  on the process  in which
the result is generated.  If the quality control  of the manufacturing  industry  is to manage  the defects
of a number  of products  produced,  the quality control of the project is to manage  one or a few
outputs  (e.g., system)  without  errors. Defect management  for many products  can be viewed as
product  quality management,  and error management  for a few outputs  can be viewed as process
quality management.  In particular,  in an IT project, as the output is intangible,  quality control for
intermediate  outputs  should be carried out at each project stage (eg, analysis,  design, execution,
testing,  deployment  stage, etc.).
Quality management  activities  for each project stage are carried out through  techniques  such
as review, inspection,  and walk-through,  which are performed  based on guidance  from specialized
quality management  organizations  (€.g., quality management  team, quality assurance  team, etc.).
In particular,  if enterprise-wide  quality control is to lead to the quality control of individual  projects,
the company  can receive guidance  on enterprise  quality standards  through the PMO (Project
Management  Office)  or check the quality level.
If such diverse  quality management  is meticulously  carried out according  to a systematic  procedure,
quality cost can be minimized  by satisfying  the quality targets  requested  by customers  (eg,
the acquirer)  at the end of the project. Another  advantage  is that Validation  and Verification  of
requirements  can reduce Rework  through  clarification.  This helps scope management  by preventing
omission  of requirements,  and schedule  management  by reducing  wasted  time.
