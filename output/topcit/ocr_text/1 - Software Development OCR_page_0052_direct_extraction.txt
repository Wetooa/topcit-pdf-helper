H) Minimum  spanning  tree
@ Introduction  to the minimum  spanning  tree
A spanning  tree is a special form of tree that includes  and connects  all vertices  in an undirected  weighted
graph. This tree should not contain a cycle. A minimum  spanning  tree is a spanning  tree whose sum of
weighted  values is the minimum.  Kruskal’s  algorithm  and Prime’s algorithm  are representative  algorithms  that
implement  a minimum  spanning  tree.
@ Kruskal’s  algorithm
An edge with the smallest  weighted  value is selected  from among the edges connected  to the vertex, and
it is checked whether  the added edge creates a cycle. Edges with a smaller weighted  value are selected
sequentially,  even though the edge with the smallest  weighted  value is selected  but not connected  to the
vertex.
@ Prim’s algorithm
A random vertex is selected  from the graph to be analyzed.  Then, a new vertex and an edge which have not
been visited before are selected  for each iterative  process  and expanded in the minimum  spanning  tree that
has been composed  up to that point.
