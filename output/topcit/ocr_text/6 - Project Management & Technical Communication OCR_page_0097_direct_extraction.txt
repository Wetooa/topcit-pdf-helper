improvement  if necessary
+ Reprioritization  of remaining  tasks (backlog).  Determining  the rate at which deliverables  are produced,
verified,  and accepted  at a given time per iteration  (pre-agreed  work cycle, typically  two weeks or one
month).
+ Determine  whether  the project  schedule  has changed
+ Management  of changes  that actually  happen
O02 Schedule  Management  Technique
A) Schedule  development  technique  - critical path method  (CPM)
The critical path method  is a network  analysis  technique  used to determine  the minimum  duration  of a project.
It is a technique  of finding  the path that determines  the minimum  duration  of the project among  many, that is,
the critical path. The critical path technique  is known as Critical Path Method.
The critical path is the minimum  path connecting  activities  with “Zero” float. Using a Project  Schedule  Network
Diagram as an input, you take into account  the sequence  of activities,  duration,  dependency,  lead, and delay
and conduct  Forward  Pass and Backward  Pass analysis  to calculate  Early Start(ES),  Early Finish(EF),  Late
Start(LS)  and Late Finish(LF).
<Table  42> Components  of Critical  Path Method
Component Characteristics  and Explanation
+ A method  of deriving  the expected  finish date based on the project  start date from duration
Forward  Pass of and the relationship  between  tasks
+ Calculate  Early Start (ES), Early Finish (EF)
+ Amethod  of deriving  the start date based on the project  finish date from duration  of and the
Backward  Pass relationship  between  tasks
+ Calculate  Late Start (LS), Late Finish (LF)
+ ES, Early Start
Early Start + The earliest date an activity can possibly begin
a + EF, Early Finish
Early Finish + The earliest date an activity can possibly  finish
Late Start + LS, Late Start
+ The latest date an activity  can start, without  delaying  the finish of the project.
Late Finish + LF, Late Finish
+ The latest date an activity  can finish, without  delaying  the finish of the project.
+ Total Float
tk + The amount  of time that an activity  can be delayed or extended  without  delaying  the projectotal Float fnish date
+ Total Float = Late Finish (LF) - Early Finish (EF) = Late Start (LS) - Early Start (ES)
