As mentioned  earlier, 3D printing  is an industry  for producing  small quantities  of a wide variety  of products  and is also
suited for personalized  manufacturing.3D  printing  is creating  a new form of production/distribution/consumption  that
is markedly  different  from traditional  manufacturing  with its strengths  in economies  of scale and low labor costs.
While existing  manufacturing  processes  are advantageous  for mass production  and is perfected  suited for especially
simple-shaped  products,  3D printing manufacturing  processes  are advantageous  for small-volume,  large variety
production.  A single equipment  can produce  many different  types of products.
The 3D printing  process  consists  of the following  steps:
- The process  of modeling  the product.
- The process  of printing  the stereoscopic  shape by stack printing  the layers that makes up the digitized  model.
- Post-processing  process  for polishing  or dyeing  the surface  of the printed object.
The 3D model data required  for 3D printing  can be generated  by a 3D scanner  when it scans the shape of objects
or the developer  can create the 3D model using a 3D modeling  program.  Prior to printing, the 3D model data is
converted  to thin layers of data by a program  called slicer. When the data converted  by the slicer is sent to a 3D
printer, a solid output is created through  the process  of stacking  thin layers of material by stacking  or hardening.
The final product is produced  through post-processing  processes,  such as removing  the temporary  supports  that
had been inserted  to support  the 3D output, shaking  off the hot powder  on the surface,  or dipping  it in an adhesive
solution  to solidify  the output.
Various technologies  are needed at each process  of 3D printing, and the critical component  technologies  for
each process  are as follows: the modeling  process  requires a  technology  for scanning  or designing  objects and for
converting  the design into data. The printing  process requires the highly complex  technology  for spraying  the raw
material  in the right location and controlling  the energy source needed for hardening  the raw material.  In materials,
work must be done on developing  a material  that is compatible  with the technology  used in the printing  process  while
also meeting  the product  requirements  dictated  by the customer.  Today, materials  research  for 3d printing  is focused
on alloys and bio-materials  due to the fact that they are materials  that create high values.
