F) Analysis
Analysis  is a document  specifying  detailed  conditions  required  when designing  or manufacturing  SW products.
In other words, it is a document  to be made to understand  the requirements  for SW in order to develop  SW.
It can be said to be a document  that understands  the nature and scope of the requirements  for software  and
clearly  describes  the constraints.
The analysis  document should include  the overall details of the implemented  SW including  the items to be ref-
erenced  in the design.

<Table 16> Principles  for writing  analysis
Classification Content
Clarity * Clearly describe  all the functions  the system will perform and the constraints  that will affect
the system.
Conciseness * Specifications  are written  concisely  and easy to understand  for both customers  and developers.
+ All the stated requirements  are verifiable,  so the desired system quality, relative  importance,
verneb  ity quality measurement  and verification  methods and standards  are specified,
on fi + The requirements  specification  describes  the external behavior  of the system and should not
Dear be designed  using a specific structure  or algorithm.
en + It is organized  hierarchically  for participants  to understand  the function  of the system or toModifiability
analyze  the impact  of changes.
Availabilty + Requirements  are numbered  with a unique identifier  for easy reference  and prioritized  as not all
requirements  are equivalent.
