[Figure  40] Quality  Management  Process
The quality management  process  can be largely divided into three stages: quality planning,  quality assurance,
and quality  control. In other words, the quality planning  stage establishes  an overall process  and plan for quality
management.  Quality  assurance  is the process  of managing  quality in the process  throughout  the business  or
manufacturing  process.  Quality  control is the stage of checking  the quality before the final product  or service
is delivered  to the customer.  Let's look at more details one by one below.
A) Quality  plan
@ Quality  Planning
Quality planning  is the task of documenting  a plan that identifies  the activities  the project  team must perform
to achieve a given quality target, and determines  how to perform it. The quality of the project should be
planned  in advance  rather than inspected  afterwards, so a quality plan should be prepared  early in the project.
@ Cost of Quality
Cost of Quality is a concept  of calculating  the cost of all activities  of the project team to achieve a
predetermined  quality target. The purpose  of quality cost management  is to reduce Failure cost of a project,
and accordingly,  the cost (Prevention  cost) for activities  to prevent  defects and the cost (Appraisal  cost) for
activities  to check/verify  the quality  of the product  relatively  get higher.
