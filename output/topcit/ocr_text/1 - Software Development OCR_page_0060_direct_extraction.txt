03 Structural  Design  Method
The process  of transferring  the results of structured  analysis,  a functional  modeling  technique,  to structured
design is called data flow-oriented  design. When a structural  method is applied, a system is logically  divided
and modularized  at an early stage of design, and top-down  refinement  is performed  by subdividing  the system
from top to bottom.
The notation  used in the structured  analysis process to represent  the data flow is called a “bubble chart” or
a “data flow diagram”  (DFD). The DFD used in the structured  analysis  technique  describes  the data flow and
function  from a logical point of view, whereas  the structure  chart used in structured  design represents  the
structure  and design of software  in detail.
The structure  diagram is a notation  frequently  used to represent  the structure  of a program.  Actually,  the
structure  diagram also includes  other contents,  in addition  to the representation  of the program  structure.
The structure  diagram shows the flow of data and control between  modules,  and represents  aspects  of the
program  control structure  - such as iteration  and selection.
The structure  diagram shows the exchange  of data and control information  between  modules,  major loops,
and decision  making,  and is a model that represents  the contents  of interaction  between  the module  system
and the modules  at the design stage. The data flow and the control flow can be distinguished  in the structure
diagram  as follows.  Data are used in calculations  to create new data or modify them. However,  controls  are not
used directly in calculations,  but instead  represent  the sequence  or condition  of calculations.  The flag that is
commonly  used in programming  has the value of “on” or “off’, and is a control signal used to imply condition
occurrence  or demarcate  the boundary.
Structured  design presents  guidelines  for converting  a requirements  specification  into a design document.  The
conversion  is determined  by the type of information  flow in the system. The information  flow can be largely
divided into two types, transform-based  and transaction-based  information  flow. A design document  can
be created using these two types of characteristics  that are present  in the requirements  specification  while
moving  from analysis  to design.
A) Transform  flow-oriented  design
Transform  flow-oriented  design is a technique  that maps the system,  which receives  and processes  information
and outputs  the result to the outside  world and the corresponding  computer  structure.  This technique  divides
a system into components  and creates a hierarchy  between  the modules  that perform the basic functions.
Transform  flow-oriented  design can divide a system into the following  three parts: The first part receives  input
and refines it as data that can be used by the system.  The second part executes  the data processing  function.
Most of the processes  that perform  calculations  belong  to this category.  The third part receives  the processed
information  and converts  and outputs it as a proper output. A system is largely divided into three parts in
this way. A set of processes  that manages  input is called an “incoming  flow’, a set of processes  that handles
the input information  is called the “transform  center’, and a set of processes  that outputs  the processed
information  is called an “outgoing  flow’.
