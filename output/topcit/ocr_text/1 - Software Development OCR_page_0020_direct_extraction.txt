01 Background  to and Purpose  of Software  Engineering
A) Introduction  to software  engineering
It is most important  to apply software  engineering  technology  to successfully  develop  software  that becomes
more multifunctional  and bigger in scale, which provides  technologies  and techniques  that support  systematic
management  to resolve the expected  difficulties  throughout  the entire process, ranging  from requirements
analysis  to maintenance.  To effectively  apply software  engineering  technology,  it is necessary  to prepare and
maintain  three key elements  in a balanced  and harmonious  manner  and make continuous  efforts to maintain
these three elements,  namely the process  of applying  the definition  of systematic  business  methods  and
flow, the organization  and people equipped  with specialized  knowledge,  and the infrastructure  and technology
required  for efficient  operation  of the defined  work methods  and organizational  personnel.

B) Background  to software  engineering
Let’s look at the history of software  engineering.  In the 1950s, the concept  of software  engineering,  like hardware
engineering,  began to be introduced  in order to implement  software  development  projects.  In the 1960s, software
engineering  was introduced  in earnest  because of the “software  crisis”, which occurred  due to the lack of
experience  and competence  of the engineers  involved  and the lack of skilled engineers,  while demand  for software
increased rapidly. In the 1970s, software  developers  became  even scarcer  as the demand  for software  increased
rapidly. To solve this problem,  many people  who did not major in software  development  were assigned  to projects.
They adopted a “coding  first and correction  later’ approach,  believing  that software  could be modified  easily
during its development.
However,  structural  or formal techniques  were developed  as many defects  were discovered  as a side effect
of the “coding  first and correction  later” approach.  They began to develop  and use the Waterfall  model, which
