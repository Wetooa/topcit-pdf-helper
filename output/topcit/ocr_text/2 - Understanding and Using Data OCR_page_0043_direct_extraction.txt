+ Preview  for practical  business
There are many cases in which a database  is used like an existing  file system,  and tables are created  in the
database,  but each table is actually  dependent  on individual  applications,  screens,  and reports.
For example,  when developing  a book management  system for each team, a booklist  table can be created
for each team during implementation  of database  in the same way as books are managed  using Excel files.
If tables are designed  in the same way as Excel files, the advantages  of the database,  including  integration,
storage,  operation,  and sharing,  cannot  be utilized  at all.
In this case, the complexity  of the application  program  also increases,  causing  symptoms  that can lead to
serious  problems,  such as an increase  in development  costs, problems  with data integrity  (lack of consistency
due to data duplication),  and the deterioration  of data processing  performance.  Therefore,  these problems.
should be prevented  and the advantages  of the database  can be maximized  and applied to the development
of a system only when we understand  the definition  and characteristics  of the database  (integration,  storage,
operation,  sharing)  and the advantages  of the database,  and then apply them to practical  business.
01 Database  Design  and Build Process
In general, the database  design and build process is performed  in the phases of collecting  and analyzing  the
requirements,  designing  the database,  building the database,  and operating  and maintaining  it. In particular,  the
analysis/design  phase is performed  in detailed  stages, such as conceptual  design, logical design, and physical  design.
The details  of the three design phases  will be described  in greater  detail in the next topic [Data modeling].
