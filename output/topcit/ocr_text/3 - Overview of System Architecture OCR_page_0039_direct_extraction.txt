Data link layer
Physical  layer The physical  layer transfers  the actual bits through  physical  media.PSTN, etc.
As shown in [Figure 5], the Internet  protocol layer is based on the ARPANET  reference  model, which was released
before the OSI layer model [3][9][10].  While documents  use slightly  different  terms for each layer, this section uses
the most commonly  used terms.
© Application  layer
Application  programs,  such as web (HTTP),  DNS, telnet, FTP, and email sending/receiving  (SMTP/POP3/IMAP4),  allow
access to services  on other layers. In the OSI reference  model, this layer's concept  includes  the presentation  layer
and the session  layer.
@ Transport  layer
Also called the host-to-host  transport  layer, the transport  layer is responsible  for data exchange  between  abstract
ports, managed  by application  programs  such as TCP, UDP. and SCTP protocols.  It is equivalent  to the transport  layer
in the OSI reference  layer.
@ Internet  layer
Also called the network  layer, it is responsible  for addressing  and routing functions.  It is equivalent  to the network
layer in the OSI reference  layer.
@ Network  interface  layer
Also called the network  access layer, the network  interface  layer has the role of actually  sending  and receiving  TCP/IP
packets  through  physical  media, such as IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 WiFi. It includes  the data link layer responsible  for
the MAC function  in the OSI reference  model, as well as the physical  layer that defines  electric  signals.
