@® Hybrid method
To compensate  for the shortcomings  of each method,  a hybrid method  of mixing each method is commonly
used to control database  access. The hybrid method  is used in the form of agent + gateway  method,  gateway
+ network  sniffing  method,  agent + gateway  + network  sniffing  method.

lying database  encryption
Description
Encryption  target  and methodSelecting  the data designated  by domestic  laws and regulations  and other important
data
Cryptographic  algorithmAn algorithm,  recommended  by cryptography  research  institutes  at home and abroad,
should be applied.  A one-way  algorithm  (SHA-256  or higher)  should be applied  to
passwords,  and a two-way  algorithm  (SEED, ARIA, AES, etc.) should be applied  to other
information.
Search  and performanceWhen applying  encryption,  performance,  such as index maintenance,  should be
considered.  Also, a method  of applying  partial encryption,  etc. should be considered
Encryption  key managementEncryption/decryption  keys and master  keys should be safely managed,  from its
generation,  to its destruction.
B) Target  and method  of database  encryption
Data, designated  by domestic laws and regulations,  and other important  data should be selected  as an
encryption  target first. The database  information  to encrypt, in accordance  with each law and regulation,
includes  passwords,  bio informat
foreign registration  numbers,  creion, resident  registration  numbers,  passport  numbers,  driver's license numbers,
dit card numbers,  account  numbers,  transaction  logs, etc. Different  encryption
methods  are required,  according  to the characteristics  of information,  and a database  should be encrypted/
decrypted,  using a cryptographic  algorithm  that fits each characteristic.
