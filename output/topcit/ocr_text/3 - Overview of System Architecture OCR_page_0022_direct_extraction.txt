"Discovery  of a ‘Chinese  hacking  chip’ in a well-known  server  board in the United
States...Industry  thrown  into commotion”  2018. 10. 05.
Citing the words of six senior US intelligence  officials on the 4th (local time), Bloomberg  reported  that a
hacking  microchip,  that was not in the design, was found on the server mainboard  of a well-known  server
manufacturer,  Super micro, and that the Chinese  Government  was allegedly  involved.

There is not a moment  in our daily lives when we do not use the services  provided  by computer  systems.
With the wide-spread  use of smartphones,  we are spending  even more time with computer  systems.  In
such an environment,  Chinese  hacking  chips can expose  our lives to hackers.  This hacking  chip was found on a
computer  system’s  board. It contains  stolen key US information  through  hardware  hacking,  which is more
threatening  than software  hacking.  This tiny chip has the capability  to steal information  from a computer
over a network. How can such a small chip contain this function?  While the early computer,  ENIAC, was
the size of a building,  computers  have become  drastically  smaller since then, and the computing  power
of smartphones  that we carry in our hand is so high, that it is not even comparable  to that of ENIAC. It is
necessary  to learn the system  architecture  to understand  the concept  of a computer  system.
