© lf all transactions  comply with the 2PL protocol,  the serialization  of all transactions  is guaranteed,  but the reverse
does not hold.
@ The 2PL protocol  is most widely used as a protocol  that can guarantee  serialization.
03 Transaction  Isolation  Level
The following  are the four transaction  isolation  levels defined  in the ANSI/ISO  SQL standard  (SQL92).
A) Read uncommitted:  Allows other transactions  to read the data that are still being processed  by the
transaction  (not yet completed).
B) Read committed:  Allows other transactions  to read the data that are confirmed  by the completed
transaction  only.
C) Repeatable  read: When a query is executed  more than twice in a transaction,  the record in the first
query does not disappear  or the value is not changed.
D) Serializable  read: When a query is executed  more than twice in a transaction,  the record in the first
query does not disappear  or the value is not changed,  and no new record appears  either.

Level 1 Read Committed x Occurs Occurs

04 Deadlock
A) Definition  of deadlock
@ Multiple processes  or transactions  are waiting for the allocation  of a specific resource infinitely  in a multi-processing
environment  or a multi-transaction  database  system.
@ Transactions  in a deadlock  can never end execution  and cannot start another  task because  system resources  are
locked.  Therefore,  when a deadlock  occurs,  the system must cancel one of the two transactions.
