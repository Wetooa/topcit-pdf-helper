In order to examine  what business  communication  is, we will first look at business  and communication,
respectively,  and then make a final definition  of business  communication.  Finally, we seek to understand
the general overview  of business communication  by looking at the key elements  that make up business
communication.
A) Definition  of business  communication
Business, by definition,  means continually  managing  something  in a structured  manner  with a certain purpose
and plan’. In general, the term business  refers to all the activities  performed  by a general company,  but in
some cases, it refers to a business  item or a business  area. In business  administration,  business  is a series of
activities  that provide  products  and services  to customers  and obtain profits in return.
Communication  in English  comes from the Latin word communicare,  meaning  “to share”. Communication  refers
to a system or process  that shares information  or meaning  through  mutually  understood  means between  two
different  people or groups.
Business  communication  refers to a system and process  in which a company  shares with various  stakeholders
information  and meanings  arising in the process  of performing  a series of business  to provide  products  or ser-
vices to customers  in return for profits.  The goal is to achieve  business  goals through  this.
