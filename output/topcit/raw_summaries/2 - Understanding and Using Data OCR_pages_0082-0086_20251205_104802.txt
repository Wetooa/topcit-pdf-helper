## Database Design: Denormalization and Performance Optimization

This guide covers denormalization techniques, key considerations for performance design, and an overview of physical database design.

---

### **Section 1: Denormalization Techniques**

Denormalization is a technique used to improve database performance, often by adding redundant data or relationships, despite violating some normalization rules.

| Technique                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example (Essence)                                          |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Adding a Functional Column** | Adds a column (e.g., `status`, `start/end date`) to a history table. **Purpose:** Prevents performance degradation when querying recent values or unspecified dates from large datasets.                 | Add `Progress status` to `Order List History` table.       |
| **2. Adding a Column by PK** | Adds data as a general attribute even if it's already part of a primary key (PK). **Purpose:** Improves performance when a primary key with multiple meanings is configured with a single attribute, and specific values are frequently queried separately. | Add `Progress status` to a `Receipt` table (where `Receipt number` might be a complex PK). |
| **3. Adding a Column to Prevent Application Malfunction** | Temporarily stores previous data in duplicate. **Purpose:** Allows users to restore original values if data was processed incorrectly, even if the duplicated data isn't meaningful for regular operations. | Add `Previous construction status` to a `Construction Work` table. |
| **4. Adding a Duplicate Relationship** | Establishes an additional relationship between entities. **Purpose:** Prevents performance deterioration by providing a direct path for data processing, even if data could be processed via several existing paths. | Direct link between `Customer` and `Delivery` (bypassing `Order List` for certain queries). |

### **Section 2: Considerations for Performance Design**

When designing a database for performance, consider the following goals and strategies:

#### **A. Performance Improvement Goals**

*   **Throughput:** The total workload processed per unit of time.
*   **Throughput Time:** The time required to complete a single unit of work.
*   **Response Time:** The delay from user input (e.g., pressing a key) to the system's response.
*   **Load Time:** The time required to load data into the database.

#### **B. Entity Integration and Splitting**

*   **Concept:** Combining similar entities into one (integration) or breaking them apart (splitting).
*   **Key Benefits of Entity Integration:**
    *   Easier to query comprehensive information.
    *   Improves performance by reducing or eliminating unnecessary JOINs.
    *   Reduces duplicate data between entities.
    *   Simplifies the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
    *   Reduces the number of physical tables.
*   **Key Shortcomings of Entity Integration:**
    *   Reduced data model scalability (changes to work may require significant changes).
    *   Can make understanding workflows from the data model difficult.
    *   Potential performance deterioration due to concentrated large amounts of data.

#### **C. Adjusting the Primary Key (PK)**

*   **Strategy:** Replace complex **Business Keys** with simpler **System Keys** when necessary.
    *   **Business Key:** A key with real-world business meaning (e.g., resident registration number, student ID). Helpful for understanding the work.
    *   **System Key:** An artificial key generated by the system based on predefined rules (e.g., auto-incrementing ID).

#### **D. Changing the Data Model Structure**

*   Performance can be improved through:
    *   **Normalization:** Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
    *   **Denormalization:** Intentionally introducing redundancy to improve read performance (as discussed in Section 1).
    *   **Data Model Simplification:** Streamlining the overall model.

#### **E. Improving Performance Related to Indexes**

*   **Designer Actions:**
    *   Efficiently specify the order of attributes within composite primary keys.
    *   Generate indexes for foreign key (FK) columns.
    *   Utilize function-based indexes (indexes on the result of a function).
    *   Properly select numbering methods (e.g., using a numbering table, maximum table value, or system objects).

---

### **Section 3: Introduction to Physical Database Design**

Physical design is a critical phase that translates a logical data model into an actual database structure, optimized for the specific Database Management System (DBMS).

#### **A. Core Concepts**

*   **Physical Design:**
    1.  **Physical Modeling:** Converts a logical data model into a physical schema (structure of tables, columns, etc.).
    2.  **Database Design Process:** Creates optimal database objects (e.g., tables, indexes, views) by considering the characteristics of the actual DBMS based on the physical model.
*   **Importance:** Physical design directly impacts database operation performance. It involves more than just defining data types and lengths; it includes decisions about data storage space and distributed database architecture.

#### **B. Key Distinctions**

*   **Physical Data Modeling:** Focuses on the structure of data, including its physical appearance (e.g., column data types, lengths, nullable properties).
*   **Database Design:** Focuses on optimizing the physical model from the DBMS perspective by designing objects like storage space allocation, object partitioning, and optimal index structures.

#### **C. Practical Business Application**

In practical terms, physical design involves:

*   **For Physical Data Modeling:** Understanding denormalization and performance design principles.
*   **For Database Design:** Understanding and applying concepts like:
    *   Relational table conversion
    *   Table design
    *   Data type design
    *   Index design
    *   Database view design
    *   Distributed database design

#### **D. Learning Objectives**

By studying physical design, you should be able to:

1.  Explain relational table conversion.
2.  Design a table effectively.
3.  Design appropriate data types.
4.  Design indexes efficiently.
5.  Design database views.
6.  Design a distributed database.

#### **E. Keywords**

*   B*Tree (a common index structure)
*   Index
*   Distributed Database
*   Relational Table

attribute.  Performance  may deteriorate  if a specific  value is separately  queried in a
single primary  key. “Adding  a column  by PK” is the method  of including  data as general
attributes  for improving  performance  even though  data already  exist in the primary  key.
