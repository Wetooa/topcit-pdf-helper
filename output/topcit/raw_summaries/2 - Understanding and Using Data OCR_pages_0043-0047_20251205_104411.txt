## Database Design and Build Process: A Learning Guide

### 1. Why Good Database Design Matters

**Problem:**
Treating a database like a simple file system (e.g., Excel) where tables depend directly on specific applications, screens, or reports.

**Consequences of Poor Design:**
*   **Loss of Database Advantages:** Cannot utilize integration, shared storage, efficient operation, or data sharing.
*   **Increased Application Complexity:** Harder to manage.
*   **Higher Development Costs.**
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Inconsistency due to data duplication.
*   **Poor Data Processing Performance.**

**Solution:**
Understand database definition and characteristics (integration, storage, operation, sharing) and apply them through proper design to maximize benefits and prevent problems.

### 2. The Database Design and Build Process

The process involves four main phases:

1.  **Requirements Collection & Analysis**
2.  **Database Design** (Detailed into Conceptual, Logical, Physical)
3.  **Database Building** (Implementation)
4.  **Operation & Maintenance**

---

### 3. Detailed Design Phases

#### A. Requirements Collection & Analysis
*   **Goal:** Understand user business needs.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Collect and analyze business requirements.
    *   Identify **static structure requirements**:
        *   **Entity:** A real-world object or concept (e.g., a "Book").
        *   **Property/Attribute:** A characteristic of an entity (e.g., "Book Title," "Author").
        *   **Relationship:** How entities connect (e.g., "Author writes Book").
        *   **Constraint:** Rules governing data.
    *   Identify **dynamic structure requirements**: Transaction types, frequency of operations.
*   **Deliverable:** Requirement Statement.

#### B. Database Design (Data Modeling)
A **data model** is a design document that defines the database structure. Design progresses through increasing levels of detail:

1.  **Conceptual Data Modeling**
    *   **Level:** High abstraction, focuses on the real-world business context.
    *   **Purpose:** Abstract conceptualization of information structure, often used for enterprise-wide data modeling (e.g., Enterprise Architecture - EA).
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Identify entities, entity identifiers (unique labels for entities), relationships, cardinality (number/sequence of relationships), and entity properties.
    *   **Representation:** Generally uses an **Entity-Relationship (ER) model**.
    *   **Deliverable:** Conceptual data model.

2.  **Logical Data Modeling**
    *   **Level:** Business-focused, less abstract than conceptual, but independent of specific database technology.
    *   **Purpose:** Convert the conceptual design into a logical structure easily storable in a database. Accurately expresses details needed for system development.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Determine **table names** (representing entities).
        *   Define **Primary Key (PK)**: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
        *   Define **Foreign Key (FK)**: A field in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table, establishing relationships.
        *   Perform **Normalization:** A process of organizing columns and tables in a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
    *   **Models Used:** Relational model (most common), network, hierarchical, object-oriented models.
    *   **Deliverable:** Logical schema.

3.  **Physical Data Modeling**
    *   **Level:** Concrete, focuses on how the database will be physically stored and accessed on a specific database system (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server).
    *   **Purpose:** Optimize performance and storage efficiency.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Determine the physical storage structure.
        *   Define **data types** for columns (e.g., INT, VARCHAR).
        *   Define constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE).
        *   Design access methods and paths for specific data (e.g., indexes).
        *   Perform transaction analysis, view design, index design, capacity design, and approach design.
        *   May include **Semi-normalization** or **Denormalization**: Intentionally introducing redundancy to improve read performance, usually done in specific performance-critical areas.
    *   **Deliverable:** Physical schema, Table Definition Document.

#### C. Database Building (Implementation)
*   **Goal:** Create the actual database based on the physical design.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Write and execute SQL statements to configure the database structure.
    *   Collect, classify, index, and process data.
    *   Enter and save the processed data into the database.

#### D. Operation & Maintenance
*   **Goal:** Ensure the database runs effectively and securely over time.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Manage and monitor database quality.
    *   Establish strategies for database recovery and restoration (backup and restore).
    *   Establish security policies.
    *   Perform continuous maintenance and follow-up evaluations.

### 4. Key Considerations for Database Design

Database design is a critical phase; clear execution and accurate deliverables are essential.

#### A. Deliverables per Design Phase:
*   **Conceptual Model:** Conceptual Data Model (defining subject area, key entities, relationships).
*   **Logical Model:** Final Entity-Relationship Diagram (defining attributes, keys, history management).
*   **Physical Model:** Physical Schema, Table Definition Document (reflecting performance considerations, potentially semi-normalization).

#### B. Key Roles in Database Design:
*   **Data Architect (DA):**
    *   Leads the database design phase.
    *   Involved from requirements collection.
    *   Establishes data management system and standards.
    *   Manages overall conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
*   **Database Administrator (DBA):**
    *   Focuses on the physical implementation and performance.
    *   Reviews and provides input on physical structure aspects like indexes, partitions, clustering storage, and denormalization.
*   **Collaboration:** DA and DBA must work together to determine the optimal final physical model for efficient and stable performance.

---

### 5. Database Design in the Project Lifecycle

Data modeling is integral to the project lifecycle, often separated into analysis and design phases.

*   **Traditional Models (e.g., Information Engineering, Structured Models):**
    *   **Analysis Phase:** Business-oriented Logical Data Modeling.
    *   **Design Phase:** Physical Data Modeling (considering hardware and performance).
*   **Spiral Model:** Logical and Physical Data Modeling are performed iteratively based on task size during analysis and design, with Logical Data Modeling often more frequent in the analysis phase.
*   **Real-world Projects:** Conceptual and Logical Data Modeling are often performed together, or even merged, primarily during the analysis phase.
*   **Project Structure:** Projects often separate "data axis" (database design) and "application axis" (application design), with mutual verification between them to ensure completeness.
*   **Object-Oriented Concept:** Data modeling and processing modeling are often integrated, not separated, as modeling focuses on objects that encapsulate both data and behavior.

+ Preview  for practical  business
There are many cases in which a database  is used like an existing  file system,  and tables are created  in the
database,  but each table is actually  dependent  on individual  applications,  screens,  and reports.
For example,  when developing  a book management  system for each team, a booklist  table can be created
for each team during implementation  of database  in the same way as books are managed  using Excel files.
If tables are designed  in the same way as Excel files, the advantages  of the database,  including  integration,
storage,  operation,  and sharing,  cannot  be utilized  at all.
In this case, the complexity  of the application  program  also increases,  causing  symptoms  that can lead to
serious  problems,  such as an increase  in development  costs, problems  with data integrity  (lack of consistency
due to data duplication),  and the deterioration  of data processing  performance.  Therefore,  these problems.
should be prevented  and the advantages  of the database  can be maximized  and applied to the development
of a system only when we understand  the definition  and characteristics  of the database  (integration,  storage,
operation,  sharing)  and the advantages  of the database,  and then apply them to practical  business.
01 Database  Design  and Build Process
In general, the database  design and build process is performed  in the phases of collecting  and analyzing  the
requirements,  designing  the database,  building the database,  and operating  and maintaining  it. In particular,  the
analysis/design  phase is performed  in detailed  stages, such as conceptual  design, logical design, and physical  design.
The details  of the three design phases  will be described  in greater  detail in the next topic [Data modeling].

B) DB design
A data model is a design document  for building a database  that has a clear goal. In the real world, a database  is
created  over time, as shown below. Depending  on the level of abstraction,  the design can be divided into a conceptual
data model, a logical data model, and physical  data.

[Figure  9] Process  of creating  a database  in the real world
First, conceptual  data modeling  is performed  to embody  the database  at the higher level that has a high level of
abstraction  in the real world. The conceptual  data model has a high level of abstraction,  focuses  on business,  and
performs  modeling  at the comprehensive  level. This model is frequently  used for enterprise  data modeling  and EA
establishment.  For reference, when deploying  EA-based  enterprise  data modeling,  general data modeling,  which is a
higher level, is performed  first, after which conceptual  data modeling  is performed  for each business  area. When an
entity-centered  data model is completed  at the higher level, a data model with a focus on concrete  business  can be
created  according  to a concrete  business  aspect  and flow, which is called “logical data modeling’.  In addition,  a method
that considers  the tablespace  according  to the storage  structure  of the database  is called “physical  data modeling”.
