## Data Modeling Essentials: A Study Guide

### 1. Introduction to Data Modeling

**What is Data Modeling?**
Data modeling is the process of abstracting the real world to design a database. It helps simplify and clarify complex information.

**The Data Modeling Procedure:**
The process follows these stages:
1.  **Requirements Analysis:** Understand what data is needed.
2.  **Conceptual Modeling:** High-level view of data.
3.  **Logical Modeling:** Detailed structure of data.
4.  **Physical Modeling:** How data is stored in a specific database system.

**Characteristics of Modeling:**
*   **Abstraction:** Expresses the real world in a specific format.
*   **Simplification:** Uses agreed protocols or limited notation.
*   **Clarification:** Removes ambiguity and accurately describes phenomena for universal understanding.

**Initial Phases:**

*   **A) Requirements Collection & Analysis:**
    *   **Goal:** Gather and analyze business needs, removing any ambiguity.
    *   **Output:** A "required specification" or "job description."

### 2. Database Design Phases

The core design proceeds in order: **Conceptual → Logical → Physical Modeling.**

**A) Conceptual Modeling:**
*   **Goal:** Abstractly conceptualize and express the information structure of the real world.
*   **Process:** Analyze data requirements, identify crucial data, and how it will be maintained.
*   **Key Focus:** Finding **core entities** and their **relationships**, expressed using an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.
*   **Identifies:** Entities, entity identifiers, relationships, relationship cardinality (number/sequence), and entity properties.

**B) Logical Modeling:**
*   **Goal:** Define the clear logical structure and rules of business information, converting the conceptual design into a database-ready structure.
*   **Process:** Converts human-understandable concepts into a structure easily stored in a database.
*   **Key Action:** **Normalization** is performed here to store data efficiently.
*   **Model Type:** Primarily uses the **relational model**.
*   **Output:** Table structure drawings, defining table names, **primary keys**, and **foreign keys**.

**C) Physical Modeling:**
*   **Goal:** Plan how the logical data model will be physically stored in a computer hardware system.
*   **Determines:** Physical storage structure (tables, columns), storage devices, and data access methods.
*   **Key Consideration:** **Performance** is crucial. **Denormalization** (reversing some normalization for speed) is often reviewed.
*   **Defines:** Column data types, constraints, and indexes.

### 4. Related Modeling Concepts

**A) Process Modeling:**
*   **Goal:** Analyze tasks to find missing or unnecessary steps to satisfy system functions. Helps in systematically classifying tasks and designing system menus/programs.
*   **Benefit:** Aids in organizing tasks, identifying gaps, and supports data model creation.
*   **Tool:** **Process Hierarchy Diagram** (subdivides tasks into function areas, functions, processes, and unit processes).

**B) Correlation Modeling:**
*   **Goal:** Analyze how processes (what is happening) interact with data (something that exists) and what events affect them.
*   **Inputs:** Uses entity types (from data modeling) and unit processes (from process modeling).
*   **Tool:** **CRUD Matrix** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    *   **Purpose:** Verifies if data is generated by entity types and unit processes. Helps validate data and process models during analysis and aids in future testing/data exchange.

### 5. Types of ER Notations

**ER Notations** are visual languages used to represent data models. Peter Chen created the first widely known form in 1976.

*   **Chen Notation:**
    *   Original form (1976), widely used for teaching data modeling theory.
    *   Uses rectangles (entity), diamonds (relationship), and ellipses (attribute).
*   **IE / Crow's Foot Notation:**
    *   Most frequently used notation in industry.
*   **IDEF1X:**
    *   Widely used, for example, in tools like ERWin and RStudio.
*   **Min-Max / ISO Notation:**
    *   Less commonly used. Includes descriptions for relationship names.
*   **UML (Unified Modeling Language):**
    *   Entities are expressed using stereotypes (e.g., `<<Entity>>`). Used for data modeling within the broader UML context.
*   **Case*Method (Barker's Notation):**
    *   Similar to Crow's Foot but with some differences in application.

### 6. Chen Model ER Notation Details

The Chen model is foundational for understanding data modeling theories.

**A) Basic Symbols:**
*   **Entity:** Rectangle
*   **Weak Entity:** Double Rectangle
*   **Relationship:** Diamond
*   **Identifying Relationship:** Double Diamond
*   **Attribute:** Ellipse
*   **Key Attribute:** Underlined Ellipse
*   **Partial Key:** Dashed Underlined Ellipse
*   **Derived Attribute:** Dashed Ellipse
*   **Complex Attribute:** Ellipse with sub-ellipses (or indicating multiple parts)
*   **Multiple Value Attribute:** Double Ellipse

**B) Entity:**
*   **Definition:** A meaningful, distinct unit of information in the real world.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Physical Objects:** Student, Car, Classroom.
    *   **Conceptual Objects:** Project, Job, Subject.
*   **Representation:** Generally a **rectangle**. Has its own unique identifier (key attribute).
*   **Weak Entity:** An entity that *does not have its own identifier* and depends on another entity for its identity. Represented by a **double-line rectangle**.

**C) Relationship:**
*   **Definition:** The correlation or association between two or more entities.
*   **Representation:** A **diamond** shape.
    *   *Example:* `[Student]` -- `(class)` -- `[Course]`
*   **Degree of Relationship:**
    *   The number of entities participating in the relationship.
    *   Examples: Unary (1 entity), Binary (2 entities), Ternary (3 entities), N-ary (N entities).
*   **Cardinality of Relationship:**
    *   The *maximum* number of relationship instances an entity can participate in.
    *   Examples: One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), Many-to-Many (N:M).

01 Concept  and Procedure  of Data Modeling
“Data modeling”  refers to the process  of abstracting  the real world to create a database  and is performed  according
to the following  procedure:  requirements  analysis,  conceptual  modeling,  logical modeling,  and physical  modeling.  That
is, modeling  refers to a technique  of expression  that uses a certain notation  to abstract,  simplify,  and clarify the real
world.
<Table 20> Characteristics  of modeling
Item Contents
Abstraction Expresses  the real world according  to a certain format.
Simplification Expresses  the real world using agreed protocols,  or limited notation  and language.
Clarification alee ambiguity  and accurately  describes  a phenomenon  so that everyone  can understand  it
A) Requirements  collection  and analysis
+ A phase in which ambiguity  is removed  from the requirements  by collecting  and analyzing  the business
requirements.
+ Arequired  specification  (or job description)  is produced  as a deliverable.
B) DB design
Design in the order of conceptual  modeling  -> logical modeling  -> physical  modeling.
C) Differences  in the academic  world’s  and industry's  understanding  of conceptual/logical  modeling
@ Understanding  the academic  world
* Conceptual  modeling  is the phase in which an ERD is produced,  whereas  logical modeling  is the phase in which the
structural  drawing  of the table is produced.  These two phases are clearly separated.
+ Therefore,  the entities  and relationships  of the ERD are identified  in the conceptual  modeling  phase, and the primary
keys and foreign keys of the table are identified  in the logical modeling  phase.
+ Normalization  that handles  table structure  should be performed  in the logical modeling  phase.
+ For reference,  “physical  modeling”  refers to the process  of creating  tables suitable  for an actual DBMS.
+ The Chen type of ERD is mainly used.
+ The relationship  itself can have its own properties  in the ERD.
+ All information  shown in the table structure  drawing  is also shown in the ERD.
@ Understanding  of the industry
+ An ERD is produced  during logical modeling.
+ Conceptual  modeling  further  abstracts  the ERD and summarizes  it at a comprehensive  level including  the subject
area, core entity, core relationship,  and core attribute.  Conceptual  modeling  is not studied  in the academic  world.
+ The Crow's Foot type of ERD is mainly used.

ESSENCE
+ If the relationship  has its own attributes,  they are included  in the connected  entity or included by identifying  a
relationship  entity.
+ For your reference,  “physical  modeling’  refers to the process  of converting  an ERD into a table structure.
+ In general,  normalization  is performed  in the logical data modeling  phase, and denormalization  is performed  in the
physical  data modeling  phase.

D) Concept  of process  modeling
“Process  modeling”  refers to the task of finding missing  or unnecessary  tasks to satisfy the functions  required  by
the target system, by analyzing  a given task efficiently  within a specified  period of time, when analyzing  large and
complex  tasks. In addition, it is regarded  as most important  to develop a high-quality  system by classifying  the
analyzed  tasks systematically  and by designing  the menu of the target  system  and program  system.
+ When  a task is analyzed  using a methodology,  the task can be arranged  systematically  in order to find most of
missing  or unnecessary  tasks, which is helpful when creating  a data model.
+ The process hierarchy  diagram is a frequently  used process model; and the task process is subdivided  into the
function  area, function,  process,  and unit process  according  to the size of the task.
E) Concept  of correlation  modeling
Correlation  modeling  is a method  of analyzing  what is happening  (process)  to something  (data) that exists within the
task concerned  and what is affected  by which event, when developing  an information  system.
+ Correlation  modeling  is performed  by using the entity type identified  from data modeling  and the unit process
identified  from process  m...
