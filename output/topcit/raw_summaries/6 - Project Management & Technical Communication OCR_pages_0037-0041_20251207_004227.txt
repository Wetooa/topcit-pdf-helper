## Communication Essentials: Official Letters, Meetings, and Emails

This guide covers key principles and methods for effective written and verbal communication in a professional setting.

---

### B) Official Letters: Principles and Methods

Official letters convey an organization's intent in business, issued under the head of the organization's name.

#### 1. Official Letter Terminology

*   **Draft Text:** A document created to receive approval from the head of the organization. It's preserved after approval.
*   **Execution Text:** Created by deleting the approval section from an approved draft text, then delivered to the recipient.

#### 2. Approval Process

Approval makes a document effective, requiring the signature of the approving authority.

*   **Signature Types:**
    *   Electronic image signatures
    *   Electronic text signatures
    *   Administrative electronic signatures
*   **Approval Types (based on authority):**
    *   **Regular Approval:** Made by the head of the organization (e.g., CEO, institution head).
    *   **Discretionary Approval:** Head delegates authority to a sub-organization leader. Has the same effect as regular approval.
    *   **Substitute Approval:** Approver temporarily delegates authority to a subordinate due to extended absence.

#### 3. General Writing Methods for Official Letters

Based on government regulations (evolved from official government documents).

*   **Numbers:** Arabic numerals are default.
    *   Currency: Use commas (e.g., 1,113,500 won).
    *   Year: No commas (e.g., 2011).
*   **Date:** Numbers only, separated by dots (e.g., 2011.12.12). Omit "year, month, day" text.
*   **Time:** 24-hour format, numbers only, separated by a colon (e.g., 17:30). Omit "hour, minute" text.
*   **Subdivision:** Follow specific administrative regulations for drafting subdivision rules.

#### 4. Item-Specific Writing Methods

*   **Sender (Top):** Organization name, top center (e.g., OOO Co., Ltd.).
*   **Recipient:** Head of the receiving organization (e.g., Mayor of Seoul).
    *   **Multiple Recipients:** Write "Refer to the list of recipients," then list them at the bottom.
*   **Reference:** The organization/person responsible for handling the document (e.g., Head of General Affairs Dept., "the person in charge of OO").
*   **Title:** A concise title encompassing the document's content.
*   **Greeting:** Start the letter with a greeting (e.g., "1. We wish all the best to your company.").
*   **Relevant Evidence (Grounds):** State the basis for sending the document. Format: "Document number (effective date), document title." Can be omitted if none.
*   **Content:** Begin with an opening statement summarizing the core, then detail supporting items.
*   **Attachment:** Marked below reference/title.
    *   Single attachment: No number.
    *   Multiple attachments: Number each (e.g., "1. One copy of OOO, 2. One copy of XXX.").
*   **"End" Mark:** The word "End" with one space after the last letter of the document. If ending with a table, place "End" at the bottom left of the table.
*   **Sender (Bottom):** Name of the head of the sending organization, lower center (e.g., CEO OOO of OOO Co., Ltd.).
*   **Contact Information:** Address, email, and phone of the person in charge for inquiries.
*   **Document Numbering:** Follow organization rules (usually abbreviation + year + serial number). Location (top/bottom) varies by organization, often at the bottom for public organizations.

B) Principles  and methods  of official letters
The document  conveyed  to clearly express  the intent of an organization  in business  settings,  in the name
of the head of the organization,  is called the official letter and it’s officially  called the draft/execution  text. A
draft text is a document  created  to receive approval  from the  head of the organization.  It is preserved  after
the approval,  and then the approval  section is deleted  to create an execution  text and deliver  to the receiving
organization.  Here, we will look at the principles  and methods  necessary  for writing  official letters.
@ Approval
This document  becomes  effective  with the signature of the approving  authority.  Signatures  include electronic
image signatures,  electronic  text signatures,  and administrative  electronic  signatures.
Approval  refers to the act of a person who has the correct  authority  to decide his or her decision,  and the types include
regular  approval,  discretionary  approval,  substitute  approval,  and cooperation.
+ Regular  approval:  Approval  made by the head of the organization.  For example,  approval  by the head of an
institution  or the CEO of a company
+ Discretionary  approval:  Refers to the fact that the head of the organization  has delegated  the approval
authority  to the leader  of the sub-organization  according  to the delegation  regulation.  In the case of approval
made through  proper  delegation,  it has the same effect as regular  approval.
+ Substitute  approval:  Refers to a case where the approver  temporarily  delegates  the approval  authority  to a
subordinate  member  when the person is absent  for an extended  period of time.
@ Methods  of Writing  Official Letters
Official letters have been evolved from government  official documents,  how to write them is based on the

are omitted  and a colon (:) is inserted  between  them (ex: 5:30 pm (x) > 17: 30 (O))
