### 5. Deep Dive: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

**Definition of ERP:**
A system that integrates an enterprise's various management resources into a single system to maximize overall productivity.

**Goals & Benefits:**
*   Maximize enterprise-wide business efficiency by integrating key business processes and sharing information.
*   Provides integrated work support and systematic linking of different business aspects.
*   Contributes to efficient data sharing and increased organizational flexibility.

**Key Characteristics of ERP:**

*   **Integration:** Designed to flawlessly connect related business operations (finance, accounting, manufacturing, sales, marketing, service) with zero redundancies.
*   **Flexibility:** Customizable and configurable by users and businesses to suit unique operational needs.
*   **Openness:** Built on international standards with an open structure, allowing integration with diverse platforms, hardware, and software.
*   **International:** Supports multiple languages and manages local data (e.g., tax items, address systems, currencies) for multinational corporations.

**Configuration & Operational Flow (Example: Order Processing):**

ERP systems organize most operational functions (purchasing, production, distribution, marketing, sales, service, finance, accounting, HR) ensuring interdependencies and balanced resource distribution.

1.  **Customer Order:** Sales representative enters the order into the ERP system.
2.  **Data Communication:** Finalized order data (quantity, delivery location/time) is communicated to relevant departments.
3.  **Raw Materials:** Data on raw materials (procurement time, quantity, price) is sent to relevant departments to meet the order.
4.  **Production:** The factory produces the order on schedule.
5.  **Production Data:** Production data is entered into ERP and transmitted to the shipping department.
6.  **Delivery:** Shipping delivers goods to the customer on the desired date.

The ERP system provides an environment where these complex operations can take place organically and efficiently.

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
+ Preview  for practical  business
Company  K is a large-scale  trading  company  that aims to become  a world-class  e-trade company  that
can grow together  with its customers.  Company  K decides  to adopt IT service management  (ITSM) for
the purpose  of bringing  about effective improvements  to the quality of its maintenance  & repair of its IT
resources,  stabilizing  the operation  of its infrastructure,  and deploying  an advanced  operational  process.
In order to use the global standard  for ITSM, company  K applies  the following  criteria to the IT Infrastructure
Library (ITIL)-based  processes,  service levels, personnel,  etc.
+ |Implementation  of ITIL-based  processes  to improve  the operational  efficiency  of ITSM.
« Transparent  management  and real-time  monitoring  of service  levels.
« Preservation  of the high-quality  level of its services  through  effective  management  of suppliers.
« Development  of strategies  for preventing  malfunctions  and monitoring/analyzing  key logs in realtime.
Also, to aid in visualizing  the ITSM, company  K introduces  events/performance  management,  configuration
management,  malfunction  management,  report management,  and a dashboard  for operating  the help desk.
The dashboard  reports  the malfunction  status of each server by the type of malfunction  and the level of
severity.  Through  the dashboard,  company  K is made instantly aware of individual  events. It provides  a
framework  for quickly  recognizing  and responding  to various  situations  that may arise during the delivery  of
IT services.
As a result, company  K is able to quickly respond  to malfunctions  that occur during IT service delivery  by
communicating  them to the malfunction  manager  almost as soon as they occur. Furthermore, by building
a knowledge  DB of malfunctions,  the company  is able to establish  measures  for averting  the recurrence  of
similar  mishaps  in the future. In addition,  ITSM enables  the company  to carry out service-level  management
(SLM) using a system,  thereby  greatly contributing  to the comprehensive  evaluation  of service levels and
the building  of trust with customers.

ESSENCE
01 Summary  of Lessons  Learned
IT business  services  consist  of a general-purpose  work support system that assists in performing  some of the
tasks involved  in running  a business;  a system that assists decision  makers when making decisions;  and IT service
management  (ITSM), a management  technique  for the systematic  management  of IT services.
The general-purpose  work support  system is composed  of ERP (enterprise  resource  planning),  SCP (supply chain
management),  and CRM (customer  relationship  management),  all of which can help an enterprise  to maintain  close
relationships  with its customers  by analyzing  their needs.
The decision  support  system consists  of the business  intelligence  (Bl) unit and the decision  support  system (DSS) for
providing  support  when making  decisions.  In both units, the backbone  is the enterprise  data warehouse  (EDW) that
collects  data internally  and externally  and analyzes  the data.
ITSM, the IT service manager,  leverages  the IT Infrastructure  Library (ITIL) in defining  the processes  and activities
of the IT services.  ITSM, when used in combination  with international  standards  like ISO/IEC 20000, can improve
and enhance  the quality of IT services.  It can also provide IT services  that will satisfy the users, but only when the
definitions  of service levels and the management  of service levels are installed  in advance.
O2 IT Business  General-Purpose  Work Support  System
A) Enterprise  solution
IT business  is a key enabler  of enterprise  competitiveness  and continuous  innovation. In the past, it was simply a tool
for supporting  business  activities,  but today it plays an important  role as a tool for survival  within a highly competitive
environment.
During the short 30-year  period since the introduction  of enterprise  computing  in the early 1980s, the power of
computers  has grown exponentially  and enterprises  have left many examples  of how computers  should be used in
the business  environment.  These examples  have now evolved  into formal solutions.
+ An “enterprise  solution”  is a collective  term for the information  systems  that support  the management  activities
which an enterprise  must perform in order to maximize  business  efficiency  and gain competitive  advantages  in its
business  environment.
+ The value and utility of an enterprise  solution  will vary depending  on the business processes  and activities  to be
defined,  and not by the function  provided  by the information  system.
+ Enterprise  solutions  are a broad concept  encompassing  advance  IT planning,  job specific solutions  that will be
configured  together ...
