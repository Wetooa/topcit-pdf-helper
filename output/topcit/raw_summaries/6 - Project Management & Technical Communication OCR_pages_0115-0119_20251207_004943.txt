## 2. Core Concepts of Quality Management

### 2.1 Software Quality
*   **Definition:** Characteristics and productivity of a software product that meets specified requirements.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Relative:** Varies by context.
    *   **Hard to quantify:** Difficult to measure objectively.
    *   **Resource-dependent:** Influenced by cost, time, manpower, tools.
    *   **Correlated:** Different quality aspects are often linked.
*   **Quality Model:** A hierarchical structure used to define, measure, and evaluate software quality:
    *   **Layer 1:** User-centric quality targets.
    *   **Layer 2:** High-level Quality Characteristics (e.g., Functionality).
    *   **Layer 3:** Specific Subcharacteristics (e.g., Suitability under Functionality).

### 2.2 ISO/IEC 9126-1 Quality Characteristics
This standard defines common software quality characteristics:

| Quality Characteristic | Subcharacteristics                                     |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |

### 2.4 Perspectives of Software Quality Evaluation
*   **Product Quality:** Focuses on the quality of the output itself (measurement, verification, validation, evaluation).
*   **Process Quality:** Focuses on improving the methods used to create the product (process improvement, audit).
*   **Project Quality:** Combines product and process quality within the project context.

### 2.5 Quality Control
*   **Definition:** All techniques and activities performed to ensure a product or service meets user requirements.
*   **Process:** Establishing quality policies, setting goals, and defining responsibilities to meet user needs ("Fitness for use") in a project.

## 3. Project Quality Management Process

### 3.1 Overview
Project Quality Management generally consists of three main elements: Quality Planning, Quality Assurance, and Quality Control.

| Classification      | Concept                                                                        | Case (Example)                        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Quality Plan**    | Identify necessary activities and plan how to achieve project quality targets. | Quality Planning                      |
| **Quality Assurance** | Third-party review to confirm results meet user requirements.                  | Design review meeting for wireframe   |
| **Quality Control** | Find and resolve causes when results fail to meet targets or standards.        | Debugging software errors             |

### 3.2 Key Stages in the Quality Management Process

#### 3.2.1 Quality Planning
*   **Purpose:** Documents activities the project team must perform to achieve quality targets, and how to do them.
*   **Timing:** Should be prepared early in the project, as quality is planned, not just inspected afterwards.
*   **Content (Sample Plan Sections):** Overview, Objective, Role & Responsibility, Quality Objective, Quality Assurance Orientation, Quality Activity, Quality Activity Reporting, Attachment.
*   **Example Measurement:**
    *   **Feature:** Functionality (Accuracy of function reflection)
    *   **Requirement:** 100% of functional requirements reflected in design.
    *   **Measurement:** (No. of function design reflections / No. of requirements) * 100.
    *   **Target:** 100%
    *   **Date:** At design stage completion.

#### 3.2.2 Quality Assurance
*   **Focus:** Managing quality throughout the project/business process.
*   **Activities:** Techniques like **Review**, **Inspection**, and **Walk-through**.
*   **Guidance:** Often performed with guidance from specialized quality management teams (e.g., QA team, PMO).
*   **PMO (Project Management Office):** Can provide enterprise-wide quality standard guidance and check project quality levels.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Minimizes quality cost.
    *   Satisfies customer quality targets.
    *   Reduces **Rework** (repeated work) by clarifying requirements through **Validation** (building the right product) and **Verification** (building the product right).
    *   Helps **Scope Management** by preventing requirement omissions.
    *   Improves **Schedule Management** by reducing wasted time.

#### 3.2.3 Quality Control
*   **Focus:** Checking the quality of outputs before final delivery to the customer.
*   **Activities:** Identifying and resolving defects or non-conformance.
*   **Project vs. Manufacturing:**
    *   **Manufacturing:** Focuses on product quality, managing defects in *many* products.
    *   **Project (IT):** Focuses on process quality, managing errors in *one or a few* intangible outputs (e.g., a system). Quality control is carried out at *each project stage* (analysis, design, execution, testing, deployment).

## 4. Cost of Quality

*   **Definition:** The total cost of all activities performed by the project team to achieve a predetermined quality target.
*   **Purpose:** To reduce **Failure Costs** by strategically increasing **Prevention Costs** and **Appraisal Costs**.

### Types of Cost of Quality

| Classification       | Concept                                        | Case (Examples)                                        |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost of Conformance** | Costs incurred to achieve quality             |                                                        |
|   **Prevention Costs** | Prevent defects from occurring.               | Education, training, documentation, equipment, improvement schedule |
|   **Appraisal Costs**  | Validate/verify product quality.              | Tests, inspections, destruction tests                  |
| **Cost of Nonconformance** | Costs incurred due to poor quality         |                                                        |
|   **Internal Failure Costs** | Correct defects before product delivery. | Rework, wasted materials (waste, waste treatment)      |
|   **External Failure Costs** | Correct defects found after delivery to customers. | Liability, defect repair, business loss                |

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
+ Preview  for practical business
Just as you frequently  checks for any abnormalities  in a car while driving a long distance,  a series of
quality control activities  are needed to ensure that the quality target is achieved  by checking  the
project  quality  level even when implementing  a project.
In general,  quality management  consists  of quality planning,  quality control, and quality assurance.
There is no significant  difference  in the overall composition,  but the quality management  of the
actual project is somewhat  different  from that of the manufacturing  industry.  For example,  if quality
control in manufacturing  is about product  quality, quality control of project can be seen as process
quality. This is due to the fact that the working  method differs depending  on the process  in which
the result is generated.  If the quality control  of the manufacturing  industry  is to manage  the defects
of a number  of products  produced,  the quality control of the project is to manage  one or a few
outputs  (e.g., system)  without  errors. Defect management  for many products  can be viewed as
product  quality management,  and error management  for a few outputs  can be viewed as process
quality management.  In particular,  in an IT project, as the output is intangible,  quality control for
intermediate  outputs  should be carried out at each project stage (eg, analysis,  design, execution,
testing,  deployment  stage, etc.).
Quality management  activities  for each project stage are carried out through  techniques  such
as review, inspection,  and walk-through,  which are performed  based on guidance  from specialized
quality management  organizations  (€.g., quality management  team, quality assurance  team, etc.).
In particular,  if enterprise-wide  quality control is to lead to the quality control of individual  projects,
the company  can receive guidance  on enterprise  quality standards  through the PMO (Project
Management  Office)  or check the quality level.
If such diverse  quality management  is meticulously  carried out according  to a systematic  procedure,
quality cost can be minimized  by satisfying  the quality targets  requested  by customers  (eg,
the acquirer)  at the end of the project. Another  advantage  is that Validation  and Verification  of
requirements  can reduce Rework  through  clarification.  This helps scope management  by preventing
omission  of requirements,  and schedule  management  by reducing  wasted  time.

01 Concept  of Quality  Control
A) Concept  of software  quality
@® Software  Quality
It refers to the characteristics  and productivity  of a software  product  that meets a given requirement.
@ Characteristics  of Software  Quality
Software  quality is a relative concept,  and it is difficult  to measure  quantitatively,  dependent  on several
resources  such as cost, time, manpower,  and tools, and correlated  with each other.
In order to measure  and evaluate  software  quality, a quality model that can first define elements  and
characteristics  representing  the quality of software  and quantify  quality in an objective  aspect in the
development  process  is required.  In general, such quality model is represented  in a hierarchical  structure.  The
first layer is composed  of quality  targets  from the user's point of view, the second layer is composed  of high-
level Quality Characteristics  that can achieve  the quality targets,  and the third layer is composed  of specific
Subcharacteristics.
