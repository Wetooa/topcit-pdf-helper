### 7. Network Layer & Routing Protocol: Operating Path Example

This scenario illustrates how data packets travel across networks using a router.

**Scenario:** User A's computer (`192.168.11.5`) wants to send data to `my.server.com` in the `220.17.23.0` network. Router B is User A's gateway (`192.168.11.1`).

1.  **Packet Creation:**
    *   TCP data is encapsulated into an IP packet, destined for `my.server.com`.

2.  **Local Transmission (User A to Router B):**
    *   User A's computer recognizes `my.server.com` is not on its local network (`192.168.11.0`).
    *   It sends the packet to its gateway: Router B (`192.168.11.1`).
    *   For local network transfer, the computer needs Router B's **MAC address** (obtained via ARP).
    *   The packet is then transmitted to Router B.

3.  **Router B Processing:**
    *   Router B receives the packet. It sees the packet's final destination is `my.server.com`, which is not directly connected to Router B's networks (`192.168.11.0` or `14.32.172.0`).
    *   Based on its routing table, Router B determines the next hop is Router C and forwards the packet.

4.  **Final Destination Reception (my.server.com):**
    *   `my.server.com` receives the packet.
    *   It checks the IP header and confirms its own IP address is the destination.
    *   The network layer header (IP address, etc.) is removed.
    *   The remaining data is sent up to higher layers (e.g., Transport Layer) for processing.
