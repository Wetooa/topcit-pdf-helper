# Information Security Learning Guide

## 1. Malware Types

Malware is malicious software designed to harm computers, file systems, or networks.

*   **Worms:**
    *   Runs independently.
    *   Self-replicates and spreads to other computers.
*   **Viruses:**
    *   Malicious code inserted into another independent program.
    *   Makes the host program perform malicious actions and spread.
*   **Trojan Horse:**
    *   A program that appears normal but contains hidden malicious code.
    *   Executes the malicious code when the user runs the program.

## 2. Major Security Solutions

These solutions protect networks and systems from various threats.

    *   **Function:** Extends ESM by collecting, analyzing, and correlating logs from across the enterprise (big data). Offers forensic capabilities for threat tracing and corporate compliance.

## 3. New Technical Terms of Information Security

Key emerging concepts and technologies in information security.

### A) Blockchain
*   **Concept:** A distributed public ledger that records all transactions in a network.
*   **Structure:** Transactions are collected into "blocks," which are then sequentially linked to form a "chain."
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Distributed Ledger:** Copies of the ledger are distributed among all network members.
    *   **P2P Network:** Operates without a central authority, allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions.
    *   **Consensus Verification:** New transactions are verified by the consent of network members.
    *   **Immutability:** Transaction information, once recorded, cannot be forged or altered.
*   **Benefits:** Increased efficiency, transparency, faster/safer transactions at lower costs, high reliability, and easy traceability.

### B) FIDO (Fast Identity Online Alliance)
*   **Purpose:** An alliance established to set technical standards for biometric authentication in online environments.
*   **Principle:** Separates local user authentication (on the device) from remote authentication (by the service provider's server).
*   **FIDO 1.0:**
    *   **UAF (Universal Authentication Framework):** Protocol designed not to store user personal information on the server.
    *   **U2F (Universal 2nd Factor):** Protocol for two-factor authentication to enhance security.
*   **FIDO 2.0:**
    *   **Goal:** Provides convenient biometric authentication and payment in PC and web environments, replacing passwords.
    *   **Implementation:** Leverages APIs from operating systems (e.g., Windows, Android) or web browsers (JavaScript API).
    *   Does not use the UAF protocol; uses its own server-defined protocol.

### C) Network Segregation and Linking
*   **Concept:** Separating a business network from external networks to block unauthorized access and prevent internal data leakage.
*   **Types:**

| Feature            | Physical Network Segregation                               | Logical Network Segregation                                  |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operation Method** | Physical separation (e.g., using two separate PCs).        | Logical separation using virtualization or software (e.g., one PC). |
| **Introduction Cost**| High (requires additional hardware).                       | Low (depends on installation environment).                   |
| **Security**       | High (fundamental separation).                             | Lower (potential for vulnerabilities).                       |
| **Efficiency**     | Low (can impact work environment).                         | Easy to manage (facilitates applying security policies).     |
| **Details**        | Examples: Two PCs, multi-PC setups, network switching devices. | Examples: Server-based or PC-based virtualization.           |

### D) Fraud Detection System (FDS)
*   **Purpose:** Detects and blocks suspicious or abnormal electronic financial transactions.
*   **Mechanism:** Comprehensively analyzes device information, access information, and transaction details.
*   **Core Engine:** **Pattern Analysis** – learns normal user transaction patterns and identifies abnormal behavior that deviates from these patterns.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Information Collection:** Gathers user/behavior information and data on accident types.
    *   **Analysis and Detection:** Analyzes correlations by user and transaction types, testing patterns to detect anomalies.
    *   **Response:** Blocks illegal transactions or requests additional authentication when abnormal behavior is detected.

### E) Quantum Cryptography
*   **Concept:** A cryptographic technology that uses principles of quantum mechanics, unlike traditional cryptography based on mathematical complexity.
*   **Key Property:** Quantum states cannot be copied or reverted to their original state without detection.
*   **Security Benefit:** If an eavesdropper attempts to measure a quantum (to intercept data), its state changes, immediately alerting the legitimate receiver to the eavesdropping attempt.

### F) Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
*   **Purpose:** A hardware-based security module designed to overcome the limitations of software-only security.
*   **Standard:** Established by the TCG (Trusted Computing Group).
*   **Function:** Provides a secure, isolated hardware space for storing critical data like encrypted keys, passwords, and digital certificates.
*   **Security:** Ensures that sensitive operations like key management and encryption processing occur entirely within the secure hardware device.
*   **Version:** The latest is TPM 2, which includes the Mobile Trusted Module (MTM).

### G) Re-identification
*   **De-identification:** The process of converting data so that an individual cannot be identified from it.
*   **Re-identification:** The process of identifying an individual from *de-identified* data by combining, analyzing, or processing it with other available information.
*   **Risk:** Can lead to the unintentional or intentional disclosure of personal information, especially with the use of big data and combining data from various sources (e.g., SNS, search engines, medical/financial records).
*   **Concern:** Heightened risk of personal information leakage due to the widespread use of big data.

### H) EU-GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
*   **Context:** The European Union's comprehensive personal information protection law, effective May 25, 2018.
*   **Importance:** It is a mandatory regulation with significant penalties for violations. Companies outside the EU (e.g., Korean companies) must comply if they process the personal information of EU residents.
*   **Purpose:** To protect personal information while also providing opportunities for its responsible utilization (through concepts like general, anonymous, and pseudonymized information).
*   **Major Changes from previous EU Directives:**
    *   **Enforcement Regulation:** It's a mandatory regulation for all member states, imposing penalties for non-compliance (unlike prior recommendations).
    *   **Extra-territorial Scope:** Applies not only to companies with a business site in the EU but also to any company globally that processes the personal information of EU residents (e.g., via e-commerce).

ESSENCE
against  computers,  file systems,  or networks.  Malware  can be classified  into the following  types:
@ Worms
Malware  that runs independently.  This malware  replicates  itself and spreads  to other computers.
@ Viruses
Viruses refer to malicious codes that are inserted into the code of another  independent  program,  then make
the program  perform  malicious  behavior  and spread on its own.
© Trojan horse
A program  with hidden codes. Although  it looks like a normal program,  malicious  code is executed  when the
user executes  the program.
G) Major security  solutions
® Firewall
A firewall  refers to a security  solution  installed  between  the public network  and the private network  to protect
the private network  from the outside. In general, there are two types of firewalls.  The first type is a packet
filtering  gateway,  which determines  whether  to pass the packet, based on a series  of rules. The second type is
a proxy server that provides  authentication  to specific hosts to access a private network  and allows them to
pass the packet. However,  a method  with increased  security  is also used, which combines  these two methods.
@ Intrusion  Prevention  System (IPS)
A security  system  that blocks intrusions  in real time by detecting  unauthorized  and abnormal  behaviors  for the
target system (network  detection  area), and by distinguishing  detected  illegal behavior.  It can be assumed  that
the characteristics  in the common  area between  the average  area of the behavior  of the intruder,  and that
of the behavior  of the authorizer,  make intrusion  detection  difficult.  The intrusion  detection  system is built
first, along with a firewall,  when implementing  a general security  system.  The purpose  of building  the intrusion
detection  system includes real-time  detection  and blocking  of illegal activities,  such as hacking,  and defense
against  attacks  performed  by using the packet,  allowed  by the firewall.
© Virtual Private Network  (VPN)
A technology  that enables  to safely use access control, authentication,  and confidentiality  services,  like a
private  network  when using a public network,  without  building  a physical  private  network  between  remote sites.
IPSec and SSL are the representative  technologies  for implementing  a VPN. The VPN can be implemented  in a
dedicated  system,  router, or firewall.
@ Single Sign On (SSO)
Single sign on enables the user to access another  site without a separate  authentication  procedure  after
logging in on one site. In general, different  systems  and sites manage  their user information  separately.
However, it is necessary  to link user information  on occasion.  In this case, SSO can be used for the integrated

authentication  of multiple  systems,  based on the information  of one user.
@® Web Application  Firewall (WAF)
Located  in front of  the web server, this security  solution monitors  incoming  traffic with the HTTP/HTTPS
protocol and blocks malicious  attacks  detected  against  the web application,  such as the SQL Injection  attack
or XSS attack, before it reaches  the web server.
© Network  Access  Control (NAC)
When at the endpoint,  when a user computer  attempts  to access the internal network  for the first time, the
system checks whether  the accessing  user computer  complies  with various  security  policies,  such as network
user authentication,  anti-virus  program installation,  etc., and controls  network  access according  to the pre-
defined  security  policy, when security  policies  are not observed.
@ Wireless  Intrusion  Prevention  System (WIPS)
The WIPS automatically  detects and blocks access from unauthorized  wireless  devices by continuously
monitoring  the wireless  LAN operated  of a specific  organization,  and it improves  the stability  of wireless  LAN
and enables integrated  management.  The WIPS provides  a function  of detecting  and blocking  an intrusion
attempt  using an unauthorized  AP or user device in the exposed  wireless  network.
Enterprise  Security  Management  (ESM)
ESM is designed  to provide a consistent  and intuitive  administrator  and user interface  by integrating  security
management  functions  modularized  by function  and product.  This security  solution  aims to build an integrated
security  management  system for all systems,  according  to standard  policies, by building  an efficient,  policy-
oriented,  and systematic  security  management  system.
© Security  Information  Event Management  (SIEM)
The SIEM solution  establishes  an early warning and monitoring  system for intelligent  threats,  which provides
correlation  analysis and forensic  functions  in the vast information  of big data, by extending  the role of the
existing  ESM from the security  domain  to the entire enterprise,  and by adding corporate  compliance  response
functions,  so that...
