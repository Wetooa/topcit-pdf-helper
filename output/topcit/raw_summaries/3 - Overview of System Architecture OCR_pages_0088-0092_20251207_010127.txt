## Learning Guide: System Architecture - Storage & Disk Management

This guide extracts essential information, definitions, and key concepts to help you understand storage technologies and disk management principles.

---

### **1. Storage System Architecture Overview**

#### **1.1 Internet SCSI (iSCSI)**
*   **Definition:** A network protocol that encapsulates **SCSI** (Small Computer System Interface) commands into **IP packets** and transmits block I/O data over standard **TCP/IP** networks.
*   **Purpose:** Allows servers to connect to storage devices over an existing Ethernet network.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduces storage implementation cost by utilizing existing network infrastructure.
    *   Ensures data reliability through technologies like **IPSec**.

#### **1.2 Storage Capacity Management**

##### **1.2.1 Thin Provisioning**
*   **Problem:** Traditional "thick LUN" (Logical Unit Number) storage allocates a fixed, often over-estimated amount of space, leading to wasted storage.
*   **Definition:** A storage virtualization technology.
*   **How it Works:** Allocates storage space on demand. It presents a large logical capacity to users but only consumes physical disk space as data is actually written.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Flexibly expands disk space as users' needs grow.
    *   Achieves a significantly higher data utilization rate.

##### **1.2.2 Data De-duplication**
*   **Definition:** A technology that improves disk space efficiency by identifying and removing redundant (duplicated) data when saving it.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Inline De-duplication:** Removes redundant data immediately as it enters the storage system.
    *   **Offline De-duplication:** Stores new data first, then processes it later to remove redundancies.

### **2. Storage Disk Scheduling**

#### **2.1 Introduction to Disk Scheduling**
*   **Context:** Disk drives, using rotating magnetic disks, have performance heavily influenced by the order of I/O requests and the resulting head movement.
*   **Definition:** A technique to efficiently manage and process multiple I/O requests to a disk drive.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   Maximize I/O requests serviced per unit time.
    *   Maximize data throughput per unit time.
    *   Minimize the average response time for requests.
    *   Minimize the variation in response times.

#### **2.2 Disk Performance Measurement Indicators**
*   **Access Time:** The total time to complete a read/write operation. It is the sum of:
    *   **Seeking Time:** Time for the disk head to move from its current position to the correct data track.
    *   **Rotational Latency (Rotational Delay):** Time for the desired data sector on the track to rotate directly under the disk head.
        *   *Note:* Modern disks often use internal buffers to minimize this.
    *   **Data Transfer Time:** Time to transfer the actual data from the disk to main memory.

#### **2.3 Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

##### **2.3.1 First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
*   **Principle:** Services I/O requests in the exact order they arrive in the queue.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Simple to implement.
    *   Provides fair service to all requests.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Often results in inefficient head movement (long seeks).
    *   Can lead to unnecessarily long response times.
    *   Cannot prioritize urgent requests.

##### **2.3.2 Shortest Seeking Time First (SSTF)**
*   **Principle:** Services the request that requires the shortest head movement (i.e., is closest) from the current head position.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Minimizes total head movement, maximizing service rate.
    *   Achieves higher processing rates and shorter average response times than FCFS.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can lead to high variability in individual request response times.
    *   **Starvation:** Requests located far from the current head position may be perpetually delayed if new, closer requests continuously arrive.

##### **2.3.3 SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
*   **Principle:** The disk head moves in one direction (e.g., inwards), servicing all requests in its path until it reaches the end of the disk (innermost/outermost cylinder). It then reverses direction and services requests on the way back.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Reduces response time variation compared to SSTF.
    *   Generally provides good throughput and average response time.
    *   Eliminates starvation.

##### **2.3.4 LOOK**
*   **Principle:** Similar to SCAN, but more efficient. The head moves in one direction, servicing requests. It changes direction *before* reaching the physical end of the disk if there are no more requests in its current direction. It "looks" for pending requests.
*   **Pros:** More efficient than SCAN by avoiding unnecessary travel to the disk's absolute ends when no requests are present there.

##### **2.3.5 Circular SCAN (C-SCAN)**
*   **Principle:** Services requests only while moving in a single predetermined direction (e.g., always outwards). When it reaches the outermost cylinder, it immediately jumps back to the innermost cylinder *without servicing any requests* on the return trip, then restarts servicing outwards.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides a more uniform and predictable response time for all requests.
    *   Improves fairness compared to SCAN.

##### **2.3.6 Circular LOOK (C-LOOK)**
*   **Principle:** Combines C-SCAN and LOOK. The head services requests in one direction. When no more requests are ahead in that direction, it jumps back to the *lowest pending request* in the opposite direction (not necessarily the physical end of the disk) and resumes servicing in the original direction.
*   **Pros:** Offers the uniformity of C-SCAN with the added efficiency of LOOK, avoiding unnecessary full-disk traversals.

---

### **3. High Availability Storage**

#### **3.1 Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Technology**
*   **Definition:** A storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one or more logical units to improve performance, enhance data reliability, and increase availability.
*   **Main Features:**
    *   **Improved Availability:**
        *   **Hot-swap function:** Allows replacing a failed disk without system downtime.
        *   Recovers data online to the replacement disk.
    *   **Increased Capacity:** Multiple physical disks are presented as a single, larger virtual disk.
    *   **Increased Speed:** Data is partitioned and transferred to multiple disks in parallel (**striping**), boosting overall transfer rates.
*   **RAID Levels:** Various levels exist (e.g., RAID-0, 1, 5, 6, 10) each offering different trade-offs in performance, capacity, and fault tolerance.

##### **3.1.1 RAID-0 (Striped Disk Array Without Fault Tolerance)**
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Requires two or more drives.
    *   Employs **disk striping**: Data is divided into blocks (stripes) and written simultaneously across all drives in the array.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Significantly increases I/O speed due to parallel processing.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **No data protection or redundancy.**
    *   If *any single drive* in the array fails, all data on the RAID-0 volume is lost.
*   **Usage:** Not suitable for critical data due to its lack of fault tolerance. Its speed benefits are often integrated into other RAID levels, such as RAID-10, which provide redundancy.

@ Internet  SCSI (iSCSI)
iSCSI encapsulates  SCSI commands  into IP packets  and transfer  the I/O block data through  TCP/IP. Technologies  like
IPSec ensure reliability.  It reduces  the network  storage implementation  cost, since it can use the existing  network
environment  as is.

@ Thin provisioning
The existing  fixed-allocation  storage  technology  uses a thick logical unit number  (LUN) wasted data storage  space.
Thin provisioning  is a storage  virtualization  technology  that allocates  data by mapping  actual data space into a thin
LUN. It can flexibly  expand  the disk space required  by users in cloud computing,  and it offers a higher  data utilization
rate than the conventional  thick LUN type.

@ Data de-duplication
The technology  provides  a high efficiency  of disk space used by removing  any duplicated  data when saving the data.
The removal methods  include  an inline method,  which immediately  removes  redundant  data as it enters the storage
system,  and an offline method,  which removes  the redundant  data after storing  the new data.
E) Storage  disk scheduling
@ Disk scheduling
A disk drive that stores data is a device using a rotating  magnetic  disk. When inputs and outputs  are requested  to this
disk drive, the system performance  varies significantly,  according  to which request  is processed  first, and the process
in moving  the head to access the data. Disk scheduling  is a technique  of efficiently  processing  I/O requests,  when
multiple  users request  them, in order to process  different  tasks. Using disk scheduling  has the following  purposes:
- Maximization  of I/O requests  to service  during  a unit time
- Maximization  throughput  per unit time
- Minimization  of the mean response  time
- Minimization  of response  time
- Minimization  of the variation  of response  time
@ Disk performance  measurement  indicator
Disk scheduling  can be compared  with the indicators  that measure  disk performance.  Disk performance  measurement
indicators  include the access  time, seeking  time, rotational  delay or rotational  latency,  and data transfer  time.

The seeking  time indicates  how long it takes to move the head from the current head position,  to the track
containing  the data. The rotational  latency  indicates how long it takes from the moment  the head begins rotating  to
move to the track containing  the data, to the moment  it reaches  the sector  that contains  the data.
Seeking  time is the time it takes to move the head from the current head position,  to the track containing  the data.
Recent  disk drives minimize  the rotational  latency  by having an internal  buffer, and by storing  all the data in the track

within the buffer. The data transfer  time indicates how long it takes to transfer  the read data to the main memory.
The access time is the sum of the seeking  time, the rotational  latency, and the data transfer  time. This section
describes  techniques  to minimize  the access  time by minimizing  the seeking  time and the rotational  latency.
@ First come first serve (FCFS) disk scheduling
FCFS services  the requests  in the order they are received.  The head position moves in the order of the requested
tracks in the disk standby  queue. It is easy to program  and provides  fair service to all requests.  However,  the head
movement  may be inefficient,  and it can unnecessarily  increase  the response  time. The execution  sequence  does not
change,  even when it receives  a priority  request.

@ Shortest seeking time first (SSRF) disk scheduling |
The scheduling  technique  first services  the request  that is closest  to the current  head position,  among  the requested
services  waiting  in the queue. It minimizes  head movement  because  it takes a lot of time to move the head in the
disk drive. It maximizes  the service response  rate per unit time by minimizing  the head movement  in order to process
the queue requests.  The response  time variation  can increase  depending  on where the requested  input or output
data is on the disk. It can cause starvation  for the requests  seeking  data that are positioned  in the inner or outer
cylinder. It offers a higher processing  rate and a shorter  mean response  time than FCFS.
