## Learning Guide: Presentation Design & Delivery

This guide covers essential aspects of designing and delivering effective presentations.

---

### 1. Designing the Presentation Body

The main body of your presentation is where you convey your core message.

#### Key Considerations for Body Design:
*   **Audience Focus:** Content must be relevant to your readers/reviewers.
*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** Use schematic writing and simple language.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   Utilize common schematics.
    *   Employ original images where appropriate.
    *   Choose proper fonts and colors.
    *   Understand and utilize the psychological messages/feelings that colors convey.

#### Effective Headings (Leading Messages):
Headings are crucial as they state the key message first.
*   **One Message Per Page:** Each heading should cover only one main topic. Avoid multiple topics in a single heading.
*   **Appropriate Length:** 1-2 sentences. Not too short to be unclear, not too long to hinder readability.
*   **Content Focus:** State "What" to do, "Why," summarize conclusions, describe key points, or present facts/data.
*   **Specificity:** Avoid vague or ambiguous content; be as specific as possible.

#### Using Charts Effectively:
Charts are vital for supporting your arguments and making them understandable and convincing.
*   **Select Appropriate Form:** Choose the chart type that best fits the data and message you want to convey.

**Common Chart Types and Their Uses:**
| Chart Type      | Purpose                                     | Example Application             |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| **Comparison**  | Show differences or rankings between items. | Sales figures by product.       |
| **Composition** | Show parts of a whole (percentage).         | Market share distribution.      |
| **Time Series** | Illustrate changes over time.               | Stock price trends.             |
| **Distribution**| Show the spread or frequency of items.      | Age groups in a population.     |
| **Correlation** | Explain relationships between variables.    | Price vs. demand.               |
| **Classification**| Categorize or group items.                 | Types of software.              |

### 2. Visualization Principles

Visualization uses schematics to make subjects easier to understand, often more effectively than lengthy text.

#### Basic Visualization Patterns:
These patterns help structure your message visually.
*   **List / Method / Factor:** For listing distinct items and describing details for each.
*   **Chronology / Order:** For items with a specific sequence (e.g., steps in a process, timeline).
*   **Parallel Relationship:** For items that are related but exist side-by-side (e.g., pros and cons).
*   **Table / Correlation:** For explaining cause-and-effect relationships.

#### Three Principles of Visualization:
1.  **Suitable Structure:** Select visual shapes (e.g., flowcharts, diagrams) that match the keywords and description method.
2.  **Easy to Understand:** Structure logic intuitively for clear comprehension.
3.  **Highlight Points:** Use color or other shapes to emphasize key points.

### 3. Reviewing Presentation Materials

After preparation, have a third party review your materials for objectivity.

#### Presentation Material Review Checklist:
*   Does it clearly answer audience needs?
*   Is emphasized content properly highlighted?
*   Are materials differentiated and suitable for the topic?
*   Is the argument's logic valid?
*   Is content priority organized (contribution to purpose)?
*   Is the text logically structured?
*   Are keywords identifiable in complex content?
*   Is the key message expressed in each chapter?
*   Are there any difficulties with diagrams or their expression?

### 4. Presentation Tools

Common tools for creating technical documents and presentations have distinct features.

#### Comparison of Popular Presentation Tools:

| Feature          | PowerPoint                                  | Keynote                                       | Prezi                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Characteristics**| Commercial, Microsoft, largest user base.   | Apple program, easy design/UI.                | Web-based (desktop app available, charged), OS-independent. |
| **Strengths**    | Rich templates, multimedia editing, formal reporting. | Easy external object import/edit, professional graphic design, excellent transitions/animations. | Many templates, beginner-friendly, good for story-based presentations. |
| **Weaknesses**   | Limited design/external object use.         | Apple Mac only, learning curve for beginners. | Presentations can look similar, requires internet for full functionality (initial download/check), limited basic shapes/templates, limited professional graphic design. |

### 5. Executing the Presentation

Effective execution is crucial, as the presenter's ability often outweighs material quality.

#### Pre-Presentation Checklist:
*   **Venue Inspection:** Visit the site, visualize the audience, simulate your movement, gestures, and do a quick practice.
*   **Material Familiarity:** Know your presentation flow well. Avoid reading directly, maintain eye contact, and project confidence.
*   **Engaging Opening:** Start with an interesting story or comment (e.g., weather, current issues) to build rapport and audience interest. Avoid immediately diving into the topic.
*   **Material Review (Technical):** Check for errors. Bring your own laptop if possible, as display may vary with different software versions or fonts.
*   **Key Points & Examples:** Re-check key points for each slide and ensure examples enhance understanding. Use presentation tools effectively or prepare a simple cue sheet.
*   **Impressive Closing:** Prepare a closing comment that leaves a lasting message. Use quotes, aphorisms, or inspiring words linked to your topic to make it memorable.

#### Effective Body Language:
According to **The Law of Mehrabian**, only 7% of communication impact comes from logical explanation, while **93% is non-verbal** (gestures, tone of voice, facial expressions). Your body language, including your voice, is powerful.

*   **Personal Appearance & Image:**
    *   Maintain a neat appearance, hairstyle, and attire to build trust.
    *   Smile! A gloomy or stiff expression creates a negative image.
*   **Eye Contact:**
    *   Maintain clear, bright eye contact to appear confident and trustworthy.
    *   Crucial for connecting with the audience. Focus ~60% on key decision-makers and ~40% on the rest of the audience.
    *   Observe reactions and build connection.
*   **Voice:**
    *   Speak with correct pronunciation and an appropriate, resonant speed.
    *   Vary your speed (slow, fast, pauses) to keep the audience immersed and emphasize points.
*   **Appropriate Motion:**
    *   Use body language to emphasize important points.
    *   Avoid exaggerated motions; use proper hand movements at the right time.
*   **Gestures for Emphasis:**
    *   Coordinate gestures with your voice. It's more effective to gesture *at the same time* or *slightly before* you speak an important point, rather than afterward.
    *   Combine eye contact with hand gestures while speaking.

@ Things to consider  for the body
When designing  the main body, be aware of the following  matters.
* Contain  the content  targeted  at the audience  (readers,  reviewers,  etc.)
+ Schematic  writing  and simplifying  expression
+ Use commonly  used schematics
+ Use original images
+ Use proper fonts and colors
+ Utilize the message  (or feeling)  that colors convey
© How to write headings  (leading  message)
The heading  (leading  message) plays a very important  role in the preparation  of presentation  material.  This
is because  the key message  is determined  first and the materials that can further explain the message  are
placed at the bottom.  The key tips for writing  the heading  are as follows.
+ One message  per page: The heading  should contain  only one topic explaining  the rest of the contents  below.
More than one topic in a single heading  sentence  can be distracting.
+ It shouldn't  be too short to understand  what it’s about, and too long to read. It should be written in an
appropriate  length. The length of the heading  is usually one or two sentences.  More than two sentences
undermine  readability.
+The content  to be included  in the heading  is what to do (What) or why, summary  of the conclusion,
description  of key points, and the facts of information  or data.
+ Avoid ambiguous  content  that is not specific.  It is necessary  to reflect  specific  content  as much as possible.
© Use of charts
When preparing  a presentation,  it is important  to have a variety of charts to present  as the basis for your
argument.  Charts are a very important  element  in the presentation, as  the appropriate  form must be selected
according  to the characteristics  of the item to be displayed  to make the audience  understood  and convinced
of your argument.
Most of the charts fall into the five types below. You should use the chart well according  to your message.

@ Basic Patterns  of Visualization
Visualization  is a way of using schematics  to better understand  the subject,  and using appropriate  schematics
is much more effective  than writing verbosely.  For visualization,  the items go through the process of
structuring  the message  using the following  pattern.
<Table 26> Basic Patterns  of Visualization

and what is the effect
Three Principles  of Visualization
+ First Principle:  With a suitable  structure-Selection  of shape types according  to the description  method of
keywords
+ Second  Principle:  Easy to understand-structured  logic for intuitive  understanding
+ Third Principle:  Highlight  points-Highlight  points to be emphasized  with color or other shapes
D) Presentation  material  Review
It is good to have a third party review the contents  after completing  all the materials  for the briefing  session
from an objective  perspective.

Key Items Review  Content
+ Was there a clear answer  to the audience's  needs?
+ Is the content  to be emphasized  properly  expressed?Are there differentiated  materials  suitable  for the
subject?
+ Argument  (keyword)-Is  the logic of the basis valid?
+ Is the priority  of content  (contribution  to achievement  of
purpose)  organized?Is the content  of the text logically  structured?
