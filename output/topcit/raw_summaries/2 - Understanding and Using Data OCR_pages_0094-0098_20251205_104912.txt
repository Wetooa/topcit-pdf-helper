## 3. Data Quality Control Framework

**Definition:** A set of activities aimed at improving data quality. Data quality can be controlled across its value, structure, and management processes.

### 3.1 Data Quality Control Areas

The framework targets different aspects of data:

#### A) Data Value
These are the actual content and characteristics of the data.
*   **Standard Data:** Data that defines common terms, domains, codes, and elements for consistent use.
    *   **Standard Word Dictionary:** Defines basic, meaningful units of words used in business.
    *   **Standard Domain Dictionary:** Defines the range of acceptable values for an attribute.
    *   **Standard Term Dictionary:** Defines common business terms by combining standard words.
    *   **Standard Code:** Symbols replacing various data values (e.g., 'M' for Male, 'F' for Female).
    *   **Data Standard Element:** Standards for data elements needed to design and build systems.
*   **Model Data:** Data needed to operate and manage data models (e.g., metadata, DBMS object information). Managed for completeness, consistency, traceability, etc.
*   **Management Data:** Data needed to effectively operate databases (e.g., usage, security, performance, quality control data).
*   **Business Data:** Data used for daily operations, classified by flow (source, operational, analysis data).

#### B) Data Structure
These describe how data is organized and related.
*   **Conceptual Data Model:** Defines high-level business entities and their relationships (subject areas, key entities).
*   **Data Reference Model:** Standard model defining data and control items by business/subject area, for architectural consistency and reuse.
*   **Logical Data Model:** A detailed model specifying the conceptual model's entities, attributes, and relationships without considering specific DBMS technology.
*   **Physical Data Model:** An actualized logical model, optimized for a specific Database Management System (DBMS) performance.
*   **Database:** The implementation of a physical model; a repository storing actual data.
*   **User View:** The screen or output from an information system that presents data to users.

#### C) Data Management Process
These are the activities involved in managing data throughout its lifecycle.
*   **Data Standard Management:** Defining, managing, and ensuring compliance with standard words, terms, domains, codes, and data elements.
*   **Requirements Management:** Collecting and reflecting user data requirements into systems and applications.
*   **Data Model Management:** Updating and maintaining data models to align with changing requirements and database structures.
*   **Data Flow Management:** Managing the process of data creation, storage, extraction, conversion, and loading.
*   **Database Management:** Tasks for stable database operation (e.g., backup, tuning, monitoring, security).
*   **Database Security Management:** Protecting the database from unauthorized actions (e.g., authentication, access control, auditing).
*   **Data Utilization Management:** Measuring data quality by analyzing adherence to quality requirements.

## 4. Data Quality Management Maturity Model

**Purpose:** To systematically assess and improve an organization's data quality control level. It provides guidelines for achieving higher maturity.

**Key Elements:**
*   **Data Quality Standard:** Defines what good quality means.
    *   **Data Validation Aspect:** Accuracy, consistency.
    *   **Data Utilization Aspect:** Usability, accessibility, timeliness, security.
*   **Data Quality Control Process:** Identifies the processes needed to achieve the quality standards (e.g., processes for improving accuracy, usability).
*   **Data Quality Control Maturity Level:** A defined scale (typically 1 to 5) indicating how systematically and elaborately data is managed. Higher levels mean more sophisticated management.

## 5. Data Standardization

**Definition:** Establishing and applying consistent principles for the name, definition, format, and rules of data elements across an entire organization.

**Overview & Purpose:**
*   Data is crucial for strategic decision-making, increasing interest in data integration and quality.
*   Data standardization helps clarify data meanings and resolve conflicting opinions about data.

**Necessity (Benefits):**
*   **Improves Communication Clarity:** Achieved by unifying data names.
*   **Reduces Search Time:** Makes it easier to find necessary data.
*   **Enhances Data Quality:** Ensures consistent data formats and rules.
*   **Lowers Integration Costs:** Reduces efforts for data conversion and cleansing when integrating systems.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
Alan Greenspan,  the former chair of the Federal Reserve (FRB), said that “Bad data is invalidating  the IT
systems  of Wall Street. One of the causes of the financial  crisis is inadequate  data’. As the scope of the
information  system  operated  by institutions  and corporations  expands  and its complexity  increases,  data
quality - including  accuracy,  consistency,  and timeliness  - is becoming  a very important  issue. That is, data
quality control has become an essential  requirement  for the operation  and management  of information
systems,  and each institution  is making efforts to present  a management  framework  for data quality
and perform data quality control based on that framework.  Therefore,  it is very important  to accurately
understand  a data quality control framework  that can be universally  applied  to multiple  organizations  and
extended  according  to the characteristics  of a given organization.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain the concept  of data quality.
2. To be able to explain the concept  of data standardization.
3. To be able to design a standardized  database  using a dictionary.

Problems  with practical  business  that occur when data quality  deteriorates
Deterioration  in data quality  brings about confusion  and distrust,  as follows.
+ The result value becomes  different  depending  on the requesting  department  (supervisory  authority,  etc.).
+ The information  provided  by IT cannot  be fully trusted.
+ It takes time and money  to improve  or adjust inaccurate  data.
+ Data reliability  cannot  be guaranteed  even with an additional  budget.
+ Decisions  cannot  be made quickly  due to inaccurate  data.
+ It is difficult  to understand  the exact number  for a specific  situation.
Effects  of data quality  control
If data quality  is managed  well, it can positively  affect an entire business  including  its information  system.
+ Sales increase,  productivity  improves,  and the market  share increases.
+ Customer  satisfaction  increases,  service  quality  improves,  and product  competitiveness  increases.
+ Business  costs decrease,  IT costs are reduced,  and rework  costs are reduced.
+ Accident  prevention,  compliance  with government  regulations,  maintenance  of market  confidence.
What if database  quality  control  and standardization  are not understood?
The importance  of quality control and standardization,  which constitute  the basis of information  systems,
is being increasingly  emphasized  as information  systems  become  larger and more complex.  If database
quality control is not clearly understood,  the information  provided by IT cannot be fully trusted because
the result value will differ depending  on the requesting  department.  In addition,  decisions  cannot be made
quickly  because  it takes a lot of time and money  to improve  and adjust inaccurate  data. On the other hand,
an inappropriate  understanding  of data standardization  can cause data duplication  and data inconsistency
for each organization,  work, and system. In addition,  information  cannot be provided  in time as it takes
more time to understand  the meaning  of data. Also, data integration,  information  system change, and
maintenance  become  very difficult  if data are not properly  standardized.  Therefore,  it is very important  to
understand  the concept  and process  of database  quality  control  and standardization.
