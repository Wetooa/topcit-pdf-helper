## Learning Guide: Transport Layer Protocols

This guide covers key concepts of TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols, their mechanisms, and uses.

---

### **1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Mechanisms**

TCP uses several mechanisms to ensure reliable data transfer.

#### **1.1. Sliding Window Protocol**

A method for flow control, allowing multiple packets to be sent without waiting for individual acknowledgements.

*   **Concept:**
    *   A "window" of packets can be transmitted before waiting for an ACK.
    *   Window size is determined by the lesser of the Receiver Window (RWND) and Congestion Window (CWND).
*   **Operations:**
    *   **Open Operation:** When an Acknowledgment (ACK) arrives, the window's right boundary moves right. This allows more data to be sent.
    *   **Close Operation:** When data is transmitted, the window's left boundary moves right. The sender no longer needs to manage this data.

#### **1.2. Window Sizes**

*   **RWND (Receiver Window):**
    *   **Definition:** The maximum packet size the receiver can handle without data loss.
    *   **Function:** Notifies the sender of its current capacity via ACKs.
*   **CWND (Congestion Window):**
    *   **Definition:** The maximum packet size the sender can transmit at once, based on network congestion.
    *   **Behavior:**
        *   Decreases if network congestion is high (more data loss).
        *   Increases if network congestion is low.

#### **1.3. Error Control**

Mechanisms to handle lost, damaged, out-of-order, or duplicated segments.

*   **Tools:**
    *   **Checksum:** A field in each segment to detect if the segment itself is damaged.
    *   **Acknowledgment (ACK):** Confirms successful receipt of a data segment. Essential for error control.
    *   **Resend:** Segments are temporarily stored in a buffer until their ACK is received. If no ACK, the segment is resent.

#### **1.4. Congestion Control**

Aims to prevent network overload by adjusting the traffic volume input to the network. TCP uses two main algorithms:

*   **Slow Start Algorithm:**
    *   **Goal:** Quickly increase transmission rate without causing congestion initially.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exponentially increases the Congestion Window (CWND) size until a certain limit is reached.
*   **Congestion Avoidance Algorithm:**
    *   **Goal:** Maintain high throughput without causing new congestion once the slow start threshold is passed.
    *   **Mechanism:** Additively increases the Congestion Window (CWND) size until congestion is detected.

#### **1.5. TCP Timers**

TCP uses four main timers for its operations:

*   **Retransmission Timer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Set to a Retransmission Time-Out (RTO) value. If no ACK is received within this time, the segment is considered lost and resent.
*   **Persistence Timer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Resolves deadlocks between sending and receiving TCPs, especially when a receiver advertises a zero window.
*   **Keepalive Timer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Prevents established TCP connections from becoming idle and being closed prematurely due to inactivity. It periodically sends small packets to check if the other end is still alive.
*   **Time-Wait Timer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used during connection termination (specifically, by the side performing an active close). It ensures all packets (including the final ACK) have been exchanged and allows duplicate packets to clear the network, preventing issues with subsequent connections.

---

### **2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

UDP is a simpler, connectionless, and unreliable transport layer protocol.

#### **2.1. Characteristics of UDP**

*   **Connectionless:** Sends/receives data without a pre-established connection.
*   **Unreliable:** Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-free data at the transport layer.
*   **Independent Datagrams:** Each UDP packet (user datagram) is treated independently and is not assigned a sequence number.
*   **Simple:** Lacks flow control, window mechanisms, and most error control (except checksum).
*   **No Congestion Control:** Does not adapt its sending rate to network congestion.
*   **"Best Effort" Service:** Aims for continuous transmission, even with some packet loss.
*   **Application Layer Responsibility:** If reliability, flow control, or robust error control are needed, the application layer must implement them.
*   **Suitable for:** Real-time applications like video streaming, where low latency is more critical than guaranteed delivery of every single packet.

#### **2.2. Common Uses of UDP**

*   Simple request-response communication (e.g., DNS queries).
*   Applications with their own internal flow/error control.
*   Multicasting (sending to multiple destinations simultaneously).
*   Network management protocols (e.g., SNMP).
*   Routing update protocols (e.g., RIP).

#### **2.3. Well-known UDP Ports**

#### **2.4. UDP Protocol Header (User Datagram)**

A fixed-size 8-byte header composed of four 2-byte (16-bit) fields.

| Field          | Length  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Source Port    | 2 Bytes | The port number of the transmitting application process (0-65,535).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Destination Port | 2 Bytes | The port number of the receiving application process on the destination host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Length         | 2 Bytes | The total length of the UDP packet, including the 8-byte UDP header and the data. Minimum is 8 bytes (header only).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Checksum       | 2 Bytes | A value used to detect data errors. It's calculated using a 16-bit one's complement sum over a "pseudo-IP header", the UDP header, and the data. If no checksum is used, this field is filled with zeros. If a receiver detects an error, the datagram is usually discarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Data Octets    | Variable | The actual application data being transmitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

*   **Simplicity:** UDP's simplicity allows it to efficiently pass data between the application layer and the IP layer without complex processing.

### **3. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**

SCTP is a newer transport layer protocol designed for multimedia communication, combining features from TCP and UDP.

#### **3.1. Characteristics of SCTP**

*   **Hybrid Design:** Combines the reliability of TCP with some flexibility of UDP.
*   **SCTP Association:** A broader concept than a TCP connection.
    *   **Multi-homing:** Allows each endpoint of an association to have one or more IP addresses. This provides network-level fault tolerance (if one path fails, another can be used).
    *   **Multiple Streams:** Unlike TCP (which uses a single stream per connection), SCTP associations can support multiple independent streams of data. This prevents head-of-line blocking (where one lost packet blocks all subsequent packets, even if they're for a different part of the application).

#### **3.2. SCTP Service Characteristics**

*   **Process-to-Process:** Provides communication between application processes.
*   **Multi-stream:** Enables multiple independent data streams within a single association.
*   **Multi-homing:** Allows endpoints to define multiple IP addresses. One is primary, others are alternatives for failover.

03 UDP (User Datagram  Protocol)
A) Characteristics  of UDP
User datagram  protocol (UDP) provides  a connectionless  service for sending  and receiving  data without  a pre-
configuration  process  for connection.  Unlike TCP. it is a protocol  that does not guarantee  the reliability  of the
transport  layer level.
Each user datagram  of UDP is an independent  datagram  and is not assigned  a number, unlike TCP. UDP is a very
simple protocol,  and there is no flow control, so there is no window  mechanism,  and packet overflow  may occur.
Error Control also has no other error control mechanism,  except for checksum.  When the receiver  detects  an error
through  a checksum,  the user datagram  is removed,  and congestion  control is not provided.  Due to this nature of the
UDP transport  protocol,  the application  layer may be necessary  in order to define and implement  the flow control
and error control. As described  above, since the UDP has a continuous  minimum  transmission  rate, despite some
packet loss, due to a lack of reception  confirmation  and retransmission  function,  it is suitable  for video play service
and is considered  to provide the best effort service. In particular,  for play...
