## Data Warehouse & Analytics: A Learning Guide

This guide covers key concepts, modeling techniques, data processing, and analysis methods used in data warehousing.

---

### 1. Data Warehouse (DW)

#### 1.1 Concept of a Data Warehouse
*   An **integrated system or database** designed for **instant analysis** of historical internal and external enterprise data.
*   Organizes data by **subject** to allow analysis from multiple viewpoints without complex programming.

#### 1.2 Characteristics of a Data Warehouse
*   **Subject-Oriented:** Focuses on specific business subjects (e.g., sales, customers) for decision-making, excluding irrelevant operational data.
*   **Integrated:** Ensures data consistency and physical unity across the company through standardization and conversion processes when data is loaded from operational systems.
*   **Time-Variant:** Retains historical data as a series of snapshots over long periods to analyze past/present trends and forecast the future. Users can track data changes over time.
*   **Non-Volatile:** A **read-only database**. Once loaded, data cannot be deleted or modified. New data adds to the history, rather than overwriting existing records.

---

### 2. Data Warehouse Modeling

#### 2.1 Definition of Data Warehouse Modeling
*   A data modeling technique for **data analysis** (unlike ER modeling for OLTP systems).
*   Enables users to analyze large-scale data from various viewpoints.
*   Data is typically organized into **fact tables** and **dimension tables**.

#### 2.2 Key Components of Data Warehouse Modeling
*   **Fact Table:**
    *   A core table composed of **measures** (quantitative values like amount, number, time).
    *   Represents the goals of information analysis.
*   **Dimension Table:**
    *   A sub-table that provides **perspectives** for analyzing the facts.
    *   Contains multiple attributes, allowing for diverse data analysis viewpoints (e.g., product name, region, date).

#### 2.3 Data Warehouse Modeling Techniques
Data warehouse models use fact and dimension tables. The two main techniques depend on how dimension tables are normalized:

*   **A) Star Schema**
    *   **Design:** A central fact table directly connected to multiple, **non-normalized** dimension tables.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Easy to understand.
        *   Fewer joins, leading to better query performance.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Data duplication can occur in dimension tables (due to non-normalization).
        *   Potential data consistency problems.
        *   Search speed can decrease if dimension table records grow exponentially.

*   **B) Snowflake Schema**
    *   **Design:** A central fact table connected to **normalized** dimension tables, which can then be further normalized into sub-dimension tables. (An extension of the Star Schema with normalization).
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Rare data duplication due to normalization.
        *   Uses less storage space.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   More joins required compared to the Star Schema, potentially degrading query performance.

### 3. ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading)

#### 3.1 Concept & Role of ETL
*   **Definition:** The entire process of moving data from source systems to the data warehouse.
*   **Role:** Ensures data consistency and integrity within the data warehouse.
*   Also known as ETT (Extraction, Transformation, Transportation).

#### 3.2 Phases of ETL

*   **A) Extraction:**
    *   **Task:** Data is extracted from original source systems (files, operational databases).
    *   **Frequency:** Traditionally daily/monthly; now can be real-time using database logs for urgent business needs.

*   **B) Transformation:**
    *   **Task:** Extracted data is **cleaned and converted** into a format suitable for the data warehouse.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Cleansing data quality issues based on reference data or business rules.
        *   Converting data types and formats to match the data warehouse schema.

*   **C) Loading:**
    *   **Task:** Converted data is sent to the data warehouse for storage, and necessary indexes are generated.
    *   **Techniques:** Can involve full updates (replacing all data) or partial updates (updating only changed data).

---

### 4. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

#### 4.1 Concept of OLAP
*   **Definition:** Allows end users to directly access and **interactively analyze multi-dimensional information** from data warehouses or data marts for decision-making.
*   **Context:** Used to analyze the operational data processed and stored via ETL.

#### 4.2 OLAP Search Techniques
OLAP provides various techniques to analyze data from different perspectives and summary levels:

*   **Drill Down:** Moves from a high summary level to a more detailed (low) summary level.
    *   *Example:* Analyzing sales from Year → Month → Day.
*   **Roll Up:** The opposite of Drill Down; moves from a low summary level to a higher summary level.
    *   *Example:* Analyzing sales from Day → Month → Year.
*   **Drill Across:** Uses an analysis viewpoint from one topic to approach another analysis topic.
*   **Pivot:** Changes the axis of the analysis perspective (e.g., swapping rows and columns in a report) to view data differently.
*   **Slice:** Creates a subset of data by selecting specific values for members in one or more dimensions at a single level.
    *   *Example:* Viewing sales data for "Product A" only.
*   **Dice:** Creates a subset of data by slicing (filtering) **more than two dimensions**.
    *   *Example:* Viewing sales data for "Product A" in "Region X" for "Q1 2023".

---

### 5. Data Mining

#### 5.1 Concept of Data Mining
*   **Definition:** A process of discovering systematic statistical rules or patterns within large datasets.
*   **Goal:** Converts raw data into meaningful information for corporate decision-making.

#### 5.2 Major Data Mining Algorithms

*   **A) Association Analysis:**
    *   **Purpose:** Discovers patterns based on combinations of highly relevant data, often in transaction datasets.
    *   **Algorithm Example:** Apriori algorithm.
    *   **Practical Use:** Recommending related products (e.g., "customers who bought X also bought Y"), optimizing product placement in stores.

*   **B) Sequence Analysis:**
    *   **Purpose:** Extends association analysis by adding the concept of **time** to find correlations of items over time. Forecasts future transactions based on historical sequences.
    *   **Algorithm Examples:** Apriori algorithm, Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP).

*   **C) Classification:**
    *   **Purpose:** Creates a tree-type model to classify the values of a specific categorical attribute by analyzing a given dataset. Predicts which category new data belongs to.
    *   **Algorithm Example:** Decision tree algorithm.

*   **D) Clustering:**
    *   **Purpose:** Groups records with similar attributes together. Identifies natural groupings within a dataset without prior knowledge of groups.
    *   **Algorithm Examples:** K-Means algorithm, EM algorithm.

01 Concept  and Characteristics  of the Data Warehouse  (DU).
A) Concept  of the data warehouse
A data warehouse  is an integrated  system or database  that enables  the user to instantly  analyze internal data
and external data generated  by the operation  system of an enterprise  over time, without  the need for separate
programming  from multiple  points of view, by integrating  data by subject.
B) Characteristics  of the data warehouse
Unlike the data repository  of OLTP for OLTP systems,  the data warehouse  generally  has the following  characteristics.
<Table  60> Characteristics  of the data warehouse
Characteristics Description
Subject-oriented+ Among  the multiple  types of operation  system  data that are managed  by data business
functions,  the data of a specific  subject  needed  for decision-making  activities  from an enterprise
perspective  is saved, while other data are not included.
Integrated+ The structure  of a data warehouse  is characterized  by data consistency  and physical  unity
through  company-wide  data standardization.
+ When obtaining  data from the operation  system,  a series of data conversion  tasks are performed
to integrate  the data.
Time variant+ To analyze  past and present  trends and forecast  the future, a data warehouse  retains  data for a
long time in the form of a series of snapshots.
+ Users can understand  the process  of data change  over time using the data history.
Non-volatile+ A data warehouse  is a read-only  database  that cannot  be deleted  or modified  once it has been
loaded from the operation  system  database.
+ When a modification  occurs  in the operation  system  data, existing  data are deleted.  The data in
the data warehouse  stores the history  of data at each point in time.
02 Data Warehouse  Modeling
A) Definition  of data warehouse  modeling
Unlike general ER modeling  for OLTP systems,  data warehouse  modeling  refers to a data modeling  technique  that,
from a data analysis perspective,  enables users to analyze large-scale  data from various  viewpoints.  Data are
generally  organized  into fact tables and dimension  tables so that end users or analysts  can easily analyze  information.
The table below shows  the main components  of data warehouse  modeling.
<Table 61> Components  of data warehouse  modeling
Item Description
+ Acore  table composed  of a set of highly relevant  measures.
Fact table + As measurement  data, a Measure  can observe  the goal of information  analysis,  such as
the amount,  number,  time, etc.

Database )
Dimension  table
B) Data warehouse  modeling  technique+ Asub-table  and a perspective  of analyzing  each fact.
+ Adimension  table has multiple  attributes,  thus allowing  data analysis  from diverse
perspectives.
A data warehouse  model organizes  data using fact tables  and dimension  tables to facilitate  the analysis  of
information.  The technique  can be divided into the ‘star schema’  and the ‘snowflake’  depending  on the dimension
table normalization  status.
<Table  62> Data warehouse  techniques
Operator Description
+ Amodeling  technique  for designing  data by separating  it into fact tables  and dimension  tables.
+ Data duplication  occurs because  dimension  table data are not normalized.
+ The schema  is easy to understand  and has few joins,  thus improving  query performance,  but
data consistency  problems  may occur.

ESSENCE
Snowflake  schema+ Amodeling  technique  for completely  normalizing  the dimension  table of the star schema.
+ Data duplication  is rare, and few storage  spaces  are used owing to the normalization  of the
dimensional  table, but there is some concern  about performance  degradation  due to the
greater  number  of  joins compared  to the star schema.

03 Concept  of ETL (Extraction,  Transformation,  Loading)
ETL refers to the entire process by which data are extracted  from the source system and stored in the data
warehouse  after cleansing  and conversion.  It plays the role of maintaining  data consistency  and integrity  among  the
components  of the data warehouse,  and is also called ETT (Extraction  Transformation,  Transportation).
