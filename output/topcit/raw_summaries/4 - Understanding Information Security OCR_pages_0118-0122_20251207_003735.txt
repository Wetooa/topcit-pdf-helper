## Learning Guide: Network Security Fundamentals

This guide covers common network attacks and essential security protocols.

---

### I. Network Attacks

#### A. Sniffer Detection
*   **What Sniffers Do:** Eavesdrop on network traffic by setting a LAN card to "promiscuous mode" (capturing all packets, not just those addressed to it).
*   **Detection Methods:** Periodically check if a host is in promiscuous mode using techniques like Ping, ARP, DNS, or induction.

#### B. Spoofing Attacks
*   **Definition:** Disguising one's own identity (e.g., IP address, hostname, MAC address) to attack target systems.
*   **Purpose:** Often used as a stepping stone for other attacks like packet sniffing, DoS (Denial of Service), or session hijacking.

##### 1. ARP Spoofing
*   **Purpose:** Tricks MAC addresses by manipulating the ARP protocol (which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Attacker (MAC: CC) tells the Client (IP: 10.0.0.3) that the Server's (IP: 10.0.0.2) MAC address is CC (attacker's MAC).
    2.  Attacker also tells the Server that the Client's MAC address is CC (attacker's MAC).
    3.  Both Client and Server now send their traffic to the Attacker's MAC address, believing they are communicating with each other.
    4.  The Attacker reads the packets, then forwards them to the legitimate destination.
*   **Result:** The attacker intercepts and can read all communication between the client and server.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   No fundamental fix due to TCP/IP protocol structure.
    *   **Temporary Fix:** Use the `arp` command to set static ARP table attributes, preventing MAC address changes. This must be re-executed after every system reboot.

##### 2. IP Spoofing
*   **Purpose:** An attacker changes their IP address to impersonate another user, illegally gaining access rights (e.g., logging in).
*   **Context: Trust Authentication:** Systems in a trusted relationship often allow login based on network address (IP) without a password. An attacker using a spoofed IP can exploit this trust.
*   **Recommendation:** Avoid using trust authentication unless absolutely necessary.

##### 3. DNS Spoofing
*   **Purpose:** An attacker takes control of a DNS server for a domain, redirecting users to an attacker-controlled system instead of their intended destination.
*   **Mechanism:** When a user requests an IP address for a domain, the attacker's DNS server provides a fake IP address, leading the user to the attacker's site.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Register the IP addresses of important access servers directly in the local `host` file to bypass DNS queries for those specific sites.
    *   **Limitation:** Realistically impossible to manage IP addresses for all servers this way.

### II. Security Protocols and Solutions

#### A. IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)

##### 1. Concept
*   **Purpose:** Developed to address security vulnerabilities in IPv4 (lack of authentication, susceptibility to eavesdropping/alteration).
*   **Function:** Provides encryption and authentication services at the IP packet level, offering security for *all* application programs.
*   **Key Areas:** Authentication, confidentiality, and key management.
*   **Implementation:** Optional in IPv4, a basic/mandatory function in IPv6.

##### 2. Composition and Operation
*   IPSec operates transparently on network devices like routers or firewalls, securing traffic *between* LANs, not typically within a single LAN.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **IKE (Internet Key Exchange):** Manages the negotiation of Security Associations (SAs) and cryptographic keys.
    *   **SAD (Security Association Database):** Stores established SAs.
    *   **SPD (Security Policy Database):** Stores security policies defining how IP traffic uses specific SAs.
    *   **AH (Authentication Header):** Provides authentication services.
    *   **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** Provides both authentication and encryption services.

##### 3. Transport Mode vs. Tunnel Mode
These are two operational modes for AH and ESP:

| Feature           | Transport Mode                                  | Tunnel Mode                                             |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encryption Scope** | Only the **payload** of the IP datagram. IP header remains unchanged. | The **entire original IP datagram** (header + payload). |
| **New IP Header?** | No                                              | Yes, a *new external IP header* is created.             |
| **Primary Use**   | Protecting upper-layer protocols (e.g., TCP fragmentation, ICMP). Operates directly above the IP layer. | Protecting all IP datagrams, often for transmitting across external networks (e.g., VPNs). Router acts as IPSec proxy. |
| **ESP Encryption**| Encrypts IP payload; authentication optional.   | Encrypts *all internal IP datagrams* (including internal header); authentication optional. |
| **AH Authentication**| Authenticates IP payload and *selected parts* of the IP header. | Authenticates *all internal IP datagrams* and *selected parts* of the *external* IP header. |

##### 4. Security Association (SA)
*   **Definition:** A record of the authentication and encryption algorithms, along with the encryption keys, that two communication entities will use. This information is exchanged and saved before communication begins.
*   **Identification:** Each SA is identified by a randomly generated **Security Parameter Index (SPI)** and the destination IP address.
*   **Directionality:** One SA is needed for secure communication in one direction. Thus, two SAs are required for two-way communication between two parties.
*   **Communication Flow (Simplified):**
    1.  System A wants to communicate securely with System B.
    2.  System A finds System B's SA in its SAD.
    3.  Using the SA's encryption key and algorithm, System A encrypts its data, inserts the SPI into the IPSec header, and sends it to B.
    4.  System B receives the encrypted data. It uses the SPI and source address to find the corresponding SA in its SAD.
    5.  Using the SA's encryption key and algorithm, System B decrypts the received data.

##### 5. IKE (Internet Key Exchange)
*   **Role:** Manages cryptographic keys for IPSec.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Determines and distributes the four keys needed for secure two-way communication (two for integrity, two for confidentiality).
    *   Creates, stores, negotiates, modifies, and removes SAs through secure authentication and message exchange between applications.

##### 6. IPSec Utilization
*   Implementing **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**.
*   Securing application layer services like secure remote access and e-commerce.

#### B. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)

##### 1. Concept
*   **Origin:** Developed by Netscape in 1994 (SSL v1.0).
*   **Standardization:** SSL version 3.0 was standardized by the IETF and renamed **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.
*   **Position:** Sits between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer (TCP/IP stack).
*   **Purpose:** Provides reliable end-to-end secure services over TCP connections.
*   **Usage:** Supported by most web browsers. While usable with various application protocols, it's most widely used with HTTP, resulting in **HTTPS**.

##### 2. Key Concepts
*   **SSL Connection:**
    *   Refers to a temporary, peer-to-peer transport relationship providing specific services.
    *   All connections are associated with one session.
*   **SSL Session:**
    *   Refers to an association established between a client and a server.
    *   A session is started before actual data communication begins.

ESSENCE
Since all sniffers  eavesdrop  on the network  by setting  their LAN cards to promiscuous  mode, a system running
a sniffer program  can be detected  by periodically  checking  if a specific host is set in promiscuous  mode. Ping,
ARP, DNS, or induction  method  can be used for detection.
® Spoofing  attack
Spoofing  is the act of disguising  and can apply to anything  related to communication,  such as the IP address,
host name, port number,  MAC address,  etc. A spoofing  attack technique  is used to attack other target systems
by disguising  its own identification  information.  The spoofing  attack is used for other attacks,  such as packet
sniffing,  DoS attack, and session  hijacking.
+ ARP spoofing
The ARP protocol  maps IP addresses  and MAC addresses,  whereas  ARP spoofing  attacks trick MAC
addresses.
As shown in [Figure 60], the attacker  first informs  the client of the fake MAC address  “CC”, corresponding
to the server (address:  10.0.0.2)  and notifies  the server of the fake MAC address  “CC”, corresponding  to the
client (address:  10.0.0.3).
Since an attacker  notifies its own MAC address  to the other communication  party (server and client
computer),  both the sever and the client send packets  to the attacker.
After the attacker  reads the packets  received from the server and the client, the server normally  sends the
packets  that the server  sends to the client, and the packets  that the client sends to the server. (As a result,
the attacker  can obtain the contents  of the communication  between  the server and the client.)
Server Attacker Client
i - fj = =a
IP address:  10.0.0.2 IP address:  10.0.0.4 IP address:  10.0.0.3
MAC address:  AA MAC address:  CC MAC address:  BB
A 1 | A
Notify that the MAC Notify that the MAC
address  of 10.0.0.3  is CC. address  of 10.0.0.2  is CC.
[Figure  60] ARP spoofing
(Source:  Yang Daeil, Introduction  to Information  Security,  Hanbit Media, p. 156)
There are no fundamental  countermeasures  against  ARP spoofing,  because  it’s the problem of the TCP/IP
protocol  structure  itself. However,  the change of the MAC address  can be prevented  by setting the attributes
of the ARP table, using the arp command  to prevent  the change of the ARP table. To use this method,  the
setting  command  should be executed  every time the system is rebooted.
+ IP spoofing
An IP spoofing  attack hacks the host by changing  its IP address.  That is, an attacker  steals the IP address  of
other users and illegally  obtains  the rights to log on or others.

Information  security )
Two systems,  A and B, that are in a trusted relationship  in the network  environment  can use a service that
enables  the user to log into system B using the system A account,  which is called trust authentication.
Authentication  is performed  by the trust service  on the network,  based on the network  address, not the
password.  That is, the server stores the trusted client IP addresses  and allows log-in without  an ID and
password,  if the client with the saved IP address  requests  log-in.
To respond  to IP spoofing,  it is recommended  not to use trust authentication,  except under special
circumstances,
+ DNS spoofing
If an attacker  takes control of the DNS server of a certain domain,  the user can be connected  to the system
designated  by the attacker,  because  the user finally obtains  that IP address  even though the user intended
to obtain the IP address  of the other system.  That is, the attacker  sniffs the DNS, designated  by the user, to
request  address  translation  and traffic from the higher-level  DNS site that gives the response,  and it passes
the IP address  of the attacker's  intended  site as the final response.
To respond  to DNS spoofing,  the IP address  of the important  access server can be registered  in the host file,
so the IP address  can be obtained  without  querying  the DNS server. However, it is realistically  impossible  to
register  and manage  the IP addresses  of all servers.
02 Security  protocols  and security  solutions
A) IPSec
@® Concept
The |Pv4 (Internet  Protocol  version 4) has no authentication  function  and is vulnerable  to attacks, such as
eavesdropping  or packet alteration.  IPsec (Internet  Protocol  Security)  was developed  to make up for the
security  vulnerability  of IP. IPSec provides  security  functions  to all application  programs  because  it supports
the safe operation  of the IP, by providing  encryption  and authentication  services  to the IP by packet unit. IPsec
encompasses  three functional  areas: authentication,  confidentiality,  and key management.  It is optional  in Ipv4,
but implemented  as a basic function  in IPv6.
@ Composition  and operation
[Figure 61] shows that when an organization  uses the LAN distributed  in several places, IP traffic is transmitted
within the LAN, but outgoing  traffic of the LAN is transmitted  using IPSec p...
