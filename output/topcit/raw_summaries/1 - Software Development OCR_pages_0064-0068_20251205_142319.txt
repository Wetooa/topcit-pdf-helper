## Software Development: Key Concepts & Architecture

### 1. Roles of the Software Architect

A software architect plays multiple critical roles throughout the development lifecycle:

*   **Creator of a Vision:** Defines the software's framework by understanding requirements, constraints, and available technologies. Requires creativity and the ability to articulate the vision.
*   **Key Technical Consultant:** Provides expert technical advice, especially in selecting appropriate design patterns and development frameworks to ensure software quality. Requires continuous learning.
*   **Decision Maker:** Leads the design team and makes crucial decisions affecting the overall design. Domain knowledge (understanding the product's application area) is vital, especially for quick decisions in agile development.
*   **Coach:** Trains teams on architectural principles, manages improvements, and provides technical feedback, acting as a technical leader.
*   **Coordinator:** Mediates differing opinions among project participants to maintain design integrity. Strong communication skills are essential alongside technical competence.
*   **Implementer:** Evaluates the impact and feasibility of new technologies, often using prototypes, from the design stage. Architects often evolve from developer roles.
*   **Advocate:** Continuously evaluates and champions new architectural approaches, justifying investments and driving technical advancement.

### 2. Software Architecture Design

#### A) Software Architecture Overview

*   **Definition:** Software architecture is a blueprint for systematically managing various factors that influence software development and complexity.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Serves as a communication tool.
    *   Aids in decision-making.
    *   Determines the overall system structure and organization of a development project.
*   **Key Aspects:** It defines modules, processes, data, their structure, relationships between components, methods for extension/modification, and how flexibility/performance are implemented.

#### B) Software Architecture Design Procedure

The design process follows these main steps:

1.  **Requirements Analysis:** Identify specific functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., through proposals, interviews).
2.  **Architecture Analysis & Design:**
    *   Identify and prioritize quality factors.
    *   Determine architectural styles and candidate architectures.
    *   Design the chosen architecture.
3.  **Architecture Verification & Approval:** Evaluate and finalize the detailed architecture.

**Key Design Concepts:**

*   **Problem Solving:** Satisfy user requirements early. Complex problems are simplified by dividing the system (e.g., logically splitting functions or user interfaces).
*   **Subsystems:** Independent, top-level program components that include data and control structures, can perform functions, and can be compiled. They are distinguished by the services they provide.
*   **Framework:** A reusable support unit that collects knowledge and provides a general, extendable structure to create concrete subsystems. It increases design abstraction by offering concrete implementation methods.

### 3. Software Architecture Styles

These are representative types of architectural structures:

*   **A) Repository Structure:**
    *   **Concept:** All shareable data is stored in a central repository, allowing multiple subsystems to access and use it.
    *   **Advantage:** Ideal for sharing large amounts of data among subsystems.
*   **B) MVC (Model-View-Controller) Structure:**
    *   **Concept:** A framework commonly used for Graphical User Interface (GUI) design that separates an object into three interconnected parts:
        *   **Model:** Manages the application data and business logic.
        *   **View:** Displays the data from the Model to the user.
        *   **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the Model or View accordingly.
    *   **Advantage:** Simplifies modifications and promotes reuse by ensuring all representations of an object are updated consistently when the underlying data changes.
*   **C) Client-Server Model:**
    *   **Concept:** Comprises clients that request services and servers that provide them. There can be multiple client instances.
    *   **Advantage:** Efficiently utilizes network systems for distributed service provision.
*   **D) Hierarchy (Layered Structure):**
    *   **Concept:** A system organized into several distinct layers, each providing specific services to the layer above it.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Simplifies problem-solving and debugging by isolating issues to specific layers.
        *   Enhances compatibility through standardization (e.g., network protocols).
    *   **Example:** The seven layers of the OSI (Open System Interconnection) model.

### 4. Method of Expressing Software Architecture Design

These models help in visualizing and documenting architectural decisions:

*   **A) Context Model (Context Diagram):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the boundary between the system being developed and its external environment.
    *   **What it shows:** Represents the entire system as a single process, detailing its input/output (IO) data and interfaces with external entities.
    *   **Focus:** Understanding the data exchange and interaction types between the user and the system before internal analysis begins.
*   **B) Component Diagram:**
    *   **Concept:** Visualizes reusable software parts (components) that can be assembled to speed up development and boost productivity. Reusability is fundamental.
    *   **Interoperability:** Components must communicate and cooperate, requiring established standards for their implementation and documentation.
    *   **Component Association:** Describes how components are assembled (e.g., sequentially, hierarchically).
*   **C) Package Diagram:**
    *   **Concept:** Represents functionally related groups of classes or subsystems, often released as commercial "packages."
    *   **Purpose:** Hides internal details of a package from external view, minimizing dependencies between packages.
    *   **Advantage:** Excellent for representing high-level software architecture by showing dependency relationships between abstracted subsystems, thereby reducing overall complexity.

### Learning Objectives

Software  Development }
+ Preview  for practical  business Roles of the software  architect
«Creator  of a vision - The requirements  and constraints  should be well understood  and
understanding  of the realized  technologies  should be improved,  based on a professional
perspective  and experience  in the type of product  to be made. A software  architect  plays the
role of completing  the framework  of the software  to be developed.  The architect’s  creativity  is
important,  and the architect  should be able to present  what has been arranged.
+ Key technical  consultant  - A key technical  consultant  advises  the development  organization
regarding  technical  matters,  based on his or her expertise.  It is particularly  important  to
properly  select a design pattern and a development  framework  because  it is the first step in
ensuring  that the quality  of a software  product  is commensurate  with its characteristics.  To this
end, continuous  knowledge  realization  and competency  development  are required.
+ Decision  maker  - Ultimately,  an architect  leads a design team in the development  of a software
product  and makes decisions  about major areas or factors  that affect the overall design.  To this
end, increasing  knowledge  about the domain  in which the product  will be used or applied  is also
defined  as an important  factor.
Recently,  this role has become  more important,  given that a proper  decision  appropriate  to the
situation  must be made quickly  and evaluated,  such as agile development,  etc.
+ Coaches  - Similar to the role of the key technical  consultant  (described  as the second role),
the coach trains the defined  architecture  and manages  its improvement  and feedback.  The role
of the coach, as a technical  leader, and coaching  is exercised  by various sponsorships  and its
position  is also strengthened.
+ Coordinates  - The different  opinions  of the various  project participants  should be coordinated
and mediated  to maintain  and ensure design integrity.  A person who can mediate  from the
technical  standpoint  is required  because  these factors may develop  into an important  risk
factor. An architect  can be seen as an authoritative  technical  mediator  in this regard.  Therefore,
proper  communication  skills are also important,  in addition  to technical  competence.
+ Implements  - When introducing  a new technology,  its impact should be evaluated  from
the design stage, and the feasibility  of its implementation  should also be evaluated  using a
prototype.  Generally,  developers  grow into architects  by improving  their skills and experience.
+ Advocates  - New architecture  should be continuously  evaluated  and a ground for introducing
and continuous  investment  should be provided.  Technical  skills and architecture  should be
advanced  continuously  through  this.

01 Software  Architecture  Design
A) Software  architecture  overview
Software  architecture  can be regarded  as a blueprint  which is used to systematically  handle various factors
that directly or indirectly  affect the development  of software  and increase  complexity.  The definition  of
software  architecture  can be expressed  in various ways. Booch defined architecture  as “a set of important
decision-making  rules about the software  structure’.  Myron Ahn[4] said that we can judge various things
from software  architecture,  such as modules,  processes,  data, and their structure;  the relationships  between
components;  the method  of extending  and modifying  these components  and relationships:  the components  of
the technology  in use; and the method  of implementing  and modifying  the flexibility  and performance  of the
system. When starting  a project, software  architecture  is used as a means of communication  and a decision-
making tool, and is also considered  when determining  the overall system structure  and organization  of a
development  project.
