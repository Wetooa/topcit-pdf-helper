## **Learning Guide: Software Configuration Management (SCM)**

### **1. Introduction to Software Configuration Management (SCM)**

**What is "Configuration"?**
*   Generally refers to:
    *   Software programs developed.
    *   Program description documents.
    *   Related data.

**What is Software Configuration Management (SCM)?**
*   A management technique to systematically organize and control all deliverables created during software development.
*   Manages the history of changes made to all software components from development through maintenance.

**Why is SCM Necessary? (Common Problems Without SCM)**
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Software is intangible, making it hard to see its current state.
*   **Difficulty in Control:** Invisible nature makes software development hard to manage.
*   **Lack of Traceability:** Hard to track the entire development process.
*   **Lack of Monitoring:** Difficulty in continuous project management due to poor visibility and tracking.
*   **Ceaseless Change:** User requirements constantly change, requiring careful management.

### **2. Core Concepts of SCM**

**Conceptual Flow of SCM Activities:**
SCM involves a continuous cycle of identifying, recording, controlling, auditing, and approving changes to configurations within a repository.

**Key Components of SCM:**
*   **Baseline:**
    *   A technical control point for a specific configuration item.
    *   It's a standard point in time from which all future changes are controlled.
*   **Configuration Item (CI):**
    *   A fundamental unit or target that is formally defined and described in the software life cycle (e.g., source code, design document, test plan).
*   **Configuration Product:**
    *   The tangible, realized output of a configuration item, formally implemented in the software development life cycle.
    *   Examples: Technical documents, hardware products, software products.
*   **Configuration Information:**
    *   The sum of a **Configuration Item** and its **Configuration Product**.

### **3. SCM Activities**

SCM is composed of four main activities:

1.  **Configuration Identification:**
    *   **Goal:** To identify and number the items targeted for configuration management.
    *   **Purpose:** To define a clear document structure, facilitate tracking, and manage information effectively.
    *   **Contents:** Products, various documents, and configuration item numbers.

2.  **Configuration Control:**
    *   **Goal:** To manage and control changes to the software configuration.
    *   **Process:** Reviewing, approving, and ensuring change requests are reflected in the defined **baseline**.
    *   Includes managing change requests, controlling changes, and supporting SCM organizational operations.

3.  **Configuration Audit:**
    *   **Goal:** To verify the integrity of the software **baseline**.
    *   **Process:** Checking if changes made to the baseline match the original requirements.
    *   Involves verification and validation activities.

4.  **Configuration Recording (Status Accounting):**
    *   **Goal:** To record and report the status and execution results of software configurations and change management.
    *   **Process:** Managing a database to store various statuses and generate reports.

### **4. Benefits & Considerations of SCM**

**Effects/Benefits of SCM:**
*   **For Administrators (Operators):**
    *   Provides a standard for systematic and effective project management.
    *   Increases ease of project control.
    *   Ensures project visibility and guarantees traceability.
    *   Establishes a baseline for quality assurance.
    *   Minimizes the impact of software changes.
*   **For Developers:**
    *   Improves software quality assurance.
    *   Enables proper management of software changes.
    *   Enhances software maintainability.

**Important Considerations for Efficient SCM:**
*   Establish a dedicated operation organization and use specialized SCM tools.
*   Implement continuous management, standards, and methods for problem-solving.
*   Tailor the level of SCM appropriately for smaller projects.
*   Formally agree upon and apply changes to defined configuration items.
*   Exercise extreme caution when changing software that is currently in use.

### **5. SCM Tools and Systems**

**Purpose of SCM Tools:**
*   Essential for managing source code, version history, changes, and enabling team collaboration.
*   Often referred to as **Version Control Systems (VCS)** or **Source Code Management (SCM) systems**.

**Evolution of SCM Systems:**
*   **Early Systems:** Based on file systems (local folder sharing).
*   **Later Systems:** Shifted to client/server models using central repositories over a network.
*   **Modern Systems:** Distributed repositories became popular.

**Types of SCM Tools:**

1.  **Folder Sharing (Legacy):**
    *   **Examples:** RCS, SCCS
    *   **Concept:** Direct file sharing without a central server.

2.  **Client/Server (Centralized Repository):**
    *   **Examples:** Subversion (SVN), CVS, Perforce, ClearCase, TFS
    *   **Concept:** Clients connect to a single central server to check out and commit files. All version history is on the central server.

3.  **Distributed Repository:**
    *   **Examples:** Git, Mercurial
    *   **Concept:** Each client/developer gets a *full copy* of the entire repository (including its history). Changes are committed locally and then pushed to other repositories.

### **6. Specific SCM Tools Explained**

*   **Subversion (SVN):**
    *   An open-source, centralized **version control system (VCS)**.
    *   Developed by CollabNet Inc. in 2000 as a replacement for CVS.
    *   Uses a server-client model where multiple clients interact with a central server.
    *   Current development is managed as an Apache project.

*   **Git (Distributed Repository Concept):**
    *   A widely used **distributed version control system (DVCS)**.
    *   Instead of just downloading the latest snapshot, clients copy the *entire repository*.
    *   **Benefit:** If the main server fails, any client's copy can be used to restore it.
    *   Source codes can be saved in multiple servers or local PCs.
    *   Each server/PC becomes a complete **repository**.
    *   Supports different **branches** (versions) in each repository, meaning there isn't a single "master version" in the system itself; branches can differ across repositories.

*   **Team Foundation Server (TFS):**
    *   A Microsoft product offering a comprehensive suite of features for software development.
    *   **Key Features:** Source code management (Team Foundation Version Control), reporting, requirements management, project management (Agile, Waterfall), automated build, lab management, testing, and release management.
    *   Functions best as a backend for Microsoft Visual Studio or Eclipse.
    *   An integrated **repository** built on SQL Server, storing all development activity information for team collaboration.

ESSENCE
Here, “configuration”  generally  refers to the program  created in the process  of software development,  the
program  description  document,  data, etc. Software  configuration  management  is a management  technique
designed  to systematically  manage  various  deliverables  created in the software  development  process.  That is,
it manages  actions  related to the history  of all component  changes  that occur from the software  development
phase to the maintenance  phase.
The table below describes  common  problems  that occur when software  configuration  is not (properly)  managed.
<Table 39> Background  of the necessity  of configuration  management
Cause  of the problem Contents
Lack of visibility Software  has no visibility  because  it is intangible.
Difficulty  in control It is practically  difficult  to control software  development  because  it is invisible.
Lack of traceability It is difficult  to trace the entire process  of software  development.
Lack of monitoring It is difficult  to manage  a project  continuously  due to a lack of visibility  and difficulty  in tracking.
Ceaseless  change Ceaseless  changes  to the user's requirements.
