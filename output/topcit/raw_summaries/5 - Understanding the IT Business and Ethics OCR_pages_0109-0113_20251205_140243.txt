## Learning Guide: Service Level Management and IT Business Performance

### 1. Service Level Agreements (SLA)

An **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer. It defines the service to be provided, the expected level of service, and the responsibilities of both parties.

*   **Key Benefits of SLAs:**
    *   **Seamless Communication:** Acts as a clear communication tool between customers and service suppliers.
    *   **Conflict Prevention:** Reduces the gap between customer expectations and actual service, providing a framework for dispute resolution.
    *   **Objective Evaluation:** Allows for quantitative and objective measurement of service quality.
    *   **Continuous Control:** Provides a structured system for managing and monitoring services.

*   **Core Components of an SLA:**
    *   **Service Level Metrics:** Quantitative measures used to judge service levels (e.g., uptime, response time).
    *   **Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** Specific target levels and minimum acceptable levels for each metric. These often include penalties for underperformance and incentives for exceeding targets.
    *   **Service Level Measurements:** Details how metrics are measured (e.g., measurement intervals, responsible team, frequency).
    *   **Service Level Reports:** Specifies the format and method for reporting service levels to stakeholders.

*   **Examples of SLA Metrics (Service Level Items / Configuration Items - CIs):**
    These metrics cover various aspects of IT services:
    *   **Application Systems:** On-time processing rates, system response speed, number of malfunctions.
    *   **System Hardware (HW):** System operation rate, backup compliance, malfunction handling rate.
    *   **Network:** Line failure rate, network availability, utilization rate.
    *   **Service Desk:** Call processing rate, call waiting rate, help desk system availability.
    *   **Security:** Immediate processing rate for IT requests, security training sessions, personal information inspection frequency.
    *   **Strategy:** Number of suggestions received, compliance with training plans.

### 2. Service Level Management (SLM)

**SLM (Service Level Management)** is a core process within ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library). It ensures that the agreed-upon service quality levels are consistently delivered, boosting customer confidence and driving continuous service improvement.

*   **Purpose:** SLM manages the **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** specified in an SLA and identifies any infringements of the agreement. It's crucial for effective IT service level management.

*   **Key Elements of SLM:**
    *   **Service Catalog:** A document listing all available IT services with their descriptions.
    *   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** The formal, written contract outlining mutually agreed IT service levels.
    *   **Service Level Objectives (SLO):** The specific IT services and their performance targets covered by the SLA.
    *   **Operational Level Agreement (OLA):** Internal agreements between different departments within the service provider. These OLAs ensure internal teams can effectively support the overall SLA.
    *   **Service Quality Plan:** An internal plan detailing all requirements to ensure agreed-upon service levels are met.
    *   **Service Report:** Periodic assessments that track compliance with the SLA and report any violations.
    *   **SLM Engine:** An automated system designed to measure service level metrics, generate reports, and monitor service performance in real-time.

*   **Critical Considerations for SLA & SLM Operations:**
    *   **Evaluation Criteria:** Must be specific, quantitative, and objective.
    *   **Verifiability:** Criteria should be easy to verify.
    *   **Baseline & Change Management:** Establish clear baselines and manage any changes smoothly.
    *   **Clear Responsibilities:** Define responsibilities for each item to prevent potential disputes.
    *   **Automated Tools:** Utilize reliable, automated management tools to streamline task execution.

### 3. IT Business Performance Evaluation

This process reviews how IT contributes to an organization's overall growth and success.

*   **Evolution of Evaluation:**
    *   **Historically:** Focused primarily on **financial aspects**, quantifying IT's direct impact on earnings. This approach was limited.
    *   **Currently:** Expanded to **comprehensive evaluations** that include both financial and **non-financial aspects**. This includes factors like enhancing corporate image, improving employee morale, and boosting job satisfaction.

*   **Key Principle:** A critical aspect is aligning individual employee performance goals with the broader enterprise performance goals.
    *   This requires strong communication among employees.
    *   Organizations must effectively balance "top-down" (management-set) and "bottom-up" (employee-driven) goal setting.

*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Financial Performance Evaluations:** Assessing IT's impact on financial results.
    *   **BSC (Balanced Scorecard):** A strategic performance management framework.
    *   **IT-BSC (IT Balanced Scorecard):** A BSC specifically adapted for IT organizations.
    *   **KPI (Key Performance Indicator):** Measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.
    *   **MBO (Management by Objectives):** A management model aiming to improve performance by clearly defining objectives that are agreed to by both management and employees.

### 4. Case Study: Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) BSC Implementation

**Background:** KIPO aimed to improve patent administration and create customer-oriented services, with a vision to promote technology innovation and protect intellectual property. As a public institution, they needed to balance public benefit with financial considerations.

**Solution:** In 2005, KIPO implemented a **Balanced Scorecard (BSC) system** to link individual employee performance targets directly to KIPO's five strategic organizational objectives.

*   **KIPO's 3-Phase BSC Implementation Process:**

    1.  **Phase 1 (Late 2004): Establishing the Strategic Framework**
        *   **Defined:** Mission, vision, and strategic goals for the organization.
        *   **Derived:** 19 Key Success Factors (KSFs) and 32 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to achieve these goals.
        *   **Completed:** Strategic framework for the office.
        *   **Communicated:** Department-level performance goals, KSFs, and KPIs.
        *   **Formalized:** Job performance agreements signed between the commissioner, bureau/department heads, and team managers based on these metrics.

    2.  **Phase 2 (Early 2005): Individual Performance Alignment & HR Integration**
        *   **Designed:** Individual-level performance management model, aligning with the organizational BSC.
        *   **Distributed:** Organizational performance indicators to individual employees, ensuring their goals reflected the broader organizational scores.
        *   **Established:** An individual performance and competency evaluation system to motivate employees.
        *   **Integrated:** Linked individual performance evaluation results more closely to the compensation system, shifting towards a performance-centered HR policy.

    3.  **Phase 3 (April-June 2005): Information System Deployment**
        *   **Implemented:** A dedicated information system for performance management, using a "best solution."
        *   **Established:** A strategic operational system to continuously monitor strategy execution and enable rapid responses to changes.

D) Understanding  SLM
SLM (Service  Level Management)  is one of the core processes  of ITIL. The use of SLM ensures  that the level of
service quality agreed upon with the customers  can be delivered  and that the process  for increasing  customer
confidence  and improving  service levels can be managed.
