## Learning Guide: Database Concepts & Design

### I. Spatial Database (Continued from Page 39)

A spatial database includes:
*   **Geometry, geographical objects, and topology** for spatial relationships.
*   **Processing of unstructured data** and large data volumes quickly.
*   **Reflection of spatial characteristics** (topological, geometric).
*   **New indexing and operations** (e.g., R-tree index) for unsortable data.
*   **Expressive data model** for complex information.
*   **Support for combining** spatial and non-spatial data.

### II. Column-Base Database

**Definition:** A database that physically stores data based on columns, unlike traditional relational databases which usually store data in rows (row-based).

**Background:**
*   Traditional row-based storage struggled with high-speed analysis of large datasets because it often required reading unnecessary data.
*   The concept isn't new (e.g., TAXIR in 1969).
*   Resurgence since the mid-2000s due to demand for rapid processing of large data, leading to developments like column store indexes, column store DBMS, and hybrid DBMS.
*   Now actively used with main memory databases.

**Comparison: Column-Based vs. Row-Based Databases**

| Feature                   | Row-Based Database                                 | Column-Based Database                                    |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical Storage**      | Stores data in row units.                          | Stores data in column units.                             |
| **Conceptual Diagram**    | Each row (record) is stored together.              | All values for a single column are stored together.      |
| **Characteristics**       | Several records stored on one disk page.           | Same column values stored continuously on one disk page. |
| **Transaction Suitability** | Good for adding, modifying, deleting data by record (OLTP). | Good for processing large amounts of data for the same column (OLAP/Analytics). |
| **Compression Efficiency** | Relatively low; records are unique.                | High; many duplicate values within a column compress well. |
| **Example SQL Patterns**  | `SELECT * FROM Table` (selects entire rows or many columns). | `SELECT AVG(COL1) FROM Table` (column-level operations). |
| **Applied DBMS**          | General OLTP RDBMS (e.g., Oracle, DB2, Sybase ASE). | RDBMS for analysis (e.g., Vectorwise, Sybase IQ, SAP HANA). |

*For a more extensive list of commercial column-oriented DBMS, refer to Wikipedia.*

### III. Recent Database Trends & Issues

*   **Evolution:** Moved from digitalizing paper records ("paperless") to managing and processing various types of unstructured data directly from a digital environment.
*   **Focus:** Less on fixed-format data, more on varied, unstructured data regardless of format or size.

**Learning Objectives:**
1.  Explain database design and build processes.
2.  Explain considerations for database design.

**Keywords:** Requirements analysis, conceptual data modeling, logical data modeling, physical data modeling, data modeling subject, deliverables for analysis, impact of design.

### IV. Practical Business Preview: Why Proper Database Design Matters

*   **Problem:** Treating a database like a simple file system (e.g., Excel files), where tables are dependent on individual applications/screens/reports, negates its benefits.
    *   Example: Creating separate "booklist" tables for each team instead of an integrated one.
*   **Consequences of Poor Design:**
    *   Cannot utilize database advantages (integration, storage, operation, sharing).
    *   Increased application program complexity.
    *   Higher development costs.
    *   Data integrity issues (inconsistency due to duplication).
    *   Deterioration of data processing performance.
*   **Solution:** Understand and apply database definitions and characteristics (integration, storage, operation, sharing) to maximize advantages and prevent problems.

### V. Database Design and Build Process

The general process involves phases:
1.  **Collect and Analyze Requirements**
2.  **Design the Database** (This phase has detailed stages)
3.  **Build the Database**
4.  **Operate and Maintain**

**Detailed Analysis/Design Phases:**
The design phase is broken down into three levels of abstraction:
*   **Conceptual Design**
*   **Logical Design**
*   **Physical Design**

     ├─ Logical Design
     └─ Physical Design

       ↓

```

#### A) Requirements Collection and Analysis

*   **Purpose:** Gather and analyze user business requirements.
*   **Deliverable:** A formal requirement statement.
*   **Identification:** Identify both static and dynamic structural requirements.
    *   **Static Structure Requirements:** Entity, property, relationship, constraint.
    *   **Dynamic Structure Requirements:** Transaction type, frequency.

#### B) DB Design: Data Models

A **data model** is a design document for building a database with a clear goal. Database design progresses through different levels of abstraction.

**[Figure 9] Process of Creating a Database in the Real World (Simplified)**

```

**Types of Data Modeling**

| Data Modeling Type   | Contents                                                                                                                  | Abstraction Level |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------- |
| **A. Conceptual**    | High abstraction, business-focused, comprehensive modeling. Used for enterprise data modeling and enterprise architecture (EA) establishment. | **Abstract**      |
| **B. Logical**       | Accurately expresses keys, attributes, relationships for system development. Highly reusable. Focuses on concrete business aspects and flow. | **Mid-Level**     |
| **C. Physical**      | Considers physical characteristics (e.g., tablespace, storage structure) to improve performance and storage efficiency for actual database implementation. | **Concrete**      |

F) Column  base database
A column base database  physically  stores data based on columns.  The data storage method of the relational
database  is not defined  as row base or column base, but general relational  databases  use a physical  storage  structure
based on rows. However,  a way to store data with this structure  reached  the limit in analyzing  large-scale  data at
high speed because  its physical  structure  required  that unnecessary  data should be also read. The concept  of column
storage  did not suddenly  appear  recently.  Rather,  this concept  was studied  relatively  early on, including  TAXIR, which
was developed  in 1969 for searching  biological  information.  Recently,  as the demand  for the rapid processing  of large
amounts  of data increased,  a function  that partially borrowed  the concept  of the column store such as the column
store index, column store base DBMS, and hybrid DBMS supporting both structures  were developed  from the mid-
2000s. Column base database  technology  is now being actively used in the DBMS market, together  with the main
memory  database.
The column  base database  has the following  structure  and characteristics  compared  to the row-based  database.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
In the past, many databases  were built to create a “paperless”  environment  in which data recorded  on paper
are digitalized  and stored in a database.  Recently,  there have been many cases in which databases  have
been elaborately  built from a digital environment  to a digital environment.  Instead  of simply managing  data
with a fixed format  or length, there is an increasing  number  of cases in which data are stored and processed
as various  types of unstructured  data regardless  of the data format  or size.

There are many cases in which a database  is used like an existing  file system,  and tables are created  in the
database,  but each table is actually  dependent  on individual  applications,  screens,  and reports.
For example,  when developing  a book management  system for each team, a booklist  table can be created
for each team during implementation  of database  in the same way as books are managed  using Excel files.
If tables are designed  in the same way as Excel files, the advantages  of the database,  including  integration,
