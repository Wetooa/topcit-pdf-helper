# Embedded Systems Learning Guide

## 1. Embedded System Development Procedure

Developing an embedded system typically follows these stages:

1.  **Product Planning**
    *   **Tasks:** Determine commercial feasibility, define rough product specifications (price, technology, marketing, timing).
    *   **Output:** Product specification chart.

2.  **Hardware & OS Selection**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Selects CPU, memory, peripherals to meet requirements at the lowest cost.
    *   **Software Team:** Selects the appropriate OS based on product characteristics and needs.

3.  **Hardware Circuit Diagram & Software Structure Design**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Generates the circuit diagram.
    *   **Software Team:** Designs module-to-module interfaces and identifies required libraries.
    *   **Output:** Hardware circuit diagram.

4.  **Code Design & Artwork Generation**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Performs "artwork," which involves generating data to physically connect parts on the circuit board (e.g., part size, connector shape, location, wiring).
    *   **Software Team:** Designs the code for each module, considering the defined interfaces.
    *   **Output:** Codes, artwork results.

5.  **PWB Manufacturing & Module Integration**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Manufactures the Printed Wiring Board (PWB) using the artwork data.
        *   *PWB:* A circuit board created by drawing circuits on a base material (e.g., copper disk) using artwork data.
    *   **Software Team:** Integrates software modules (e.g., bootloader, OS kernel, applications).
    *   **Output:** PWB.

6.  **Part Mounting & Hardware Testing**
    *   **Hardware Team:** Mounts physical parts (CPU, memory) onto the PWB.
    *   **Software Team:** Tests the actual hardware with a specific test program to ensure normal operation of parts, CPU ports, memory, and I/O devices.
    *   **Output:** Test results.

7.  **Integrated Testing & Debugging**
    *   **Tasks:** Install software on hardware, solve identified problems, establish countermeasures for unexpected issues (e.g., part defects). This stage focuses on functional stabilization and is conducted in various environments (e.g., extreme temperatures) for several months before mass production.

8.  **Mass Production Testing & Quality Inspection**
    *   **Tasks:** Conduct comprehensive quality checks.
        *   **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference):** Inspect for interference of electromagnetic waves on other electronic parts.
        *   **Safety:** Perform product stability tests.
    *   **Output:** EMI and safety results.

9.  **Product Shipment**
    *   **Task:** Ship the finished product.

## 2. Embedded Hardware

### A) Microprocessors (MPUs) & Microcontrollers

*   **Microprocessor Unit (MPU):** Early MPUs integrated data processing (registers), arithmetic operations (ALU), and result storage (flags) into a single chip. They provide the processing power for devices.
*   **Microcontroller:** A single chip with a built-in processor, memory, and control interface. Often used for real-time operating systems and automatic controls.
*   **Ubiquity:** MPUs are found in almost all electronic devices with user interaction, such as smartphones, smart bands, tablet PCs, mechanical keyboards, TVs, air conditioners, game consoles, and smart keys.
*   **Market Difference:** Unlike the PC CPU market (dominated by Intel/AMD), many companies produce MPUs for embedded systems (e.g., Broadcom, Mediatek, Samsung, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, TI).
*   **System on Chip (SoC):** A key trend where all integrated circuits (ICs) for a specific function are combined into a single CPU chip, reducing the need for separate peripheral chips on the board.
*   **Common Architectures:** Embedded systems use various CPU architectures from 8-bit to 64-bit, including ARM, MIPS, ColdFire/68K, PowerPC, x86, PIC, and 8051.

### B) Technical Trends in Embedded Hardware

1.  **Expanded Connectivity:** Increasing adoption of wireless technologies like WiFi, LTE, BLE, and ZigBee in embedded systems. Focus on IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communication and device interoperability.
2.  **Low-Power 32-bit Processors:** A shift from 8-bit to 32-bit processors, leading to a rapid increase in embedded systems using operating systems, particularly general-purpose OS like Linux.
3.  **Polarization of OS:**
    *   **Lightweight/Low-Power OS:** For wearables and IoT devices, prioritizing minimal resource consumption.
    *   **General-Purpose OS:** For conventional embedded devices, supporting high functionality, stability, and user convenience features like 3D acceleration GUI and multimedia.

## 3. Embedded Software

### A) Definition & Technology Fields

*   **Definition:** Software designed to run within embedded systems. Its complexity increases as embedded system applications diversify.
*   **Technology Fields:**
    *   **Basic Embedded Applications:** Multimedia players, map viewers, browsers, games, mobile shop apps, CNS (GPS, GIS).
    *   **Embedded Middleware:** Software that enables different components or applications to communicate. Examples include distributed middleware (CORBA, XML), Java middleware (JVM, J2ME), control middleware (Jini, UPnP), multimedia middleware (streaming, codecs), and communication middleware (WLAN, WPAN).
    *   **Embedded System Software:** Core software components like the Embedded OS, device drivers, communication protocols (wired/wireless), multimedia protocols, and embedded DBMS.
    *   **Embedded System Development Tools:** Tools to aid in development, such as design tools, test tools, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), simulators, cross compilers, and remote monitors.
    *   **Embedded Software Platforms:** Frameworks or environments for developing embedded applications (e.g., MS .NET Compact Framework, Sun ONE, Brew, WIPI).

### B) Characteristics of Embedded Software

Embedded software continuously interacts with its physical environment, processing signals and responding to changes. Key characteristics include:

*   **Reactivity:** Continuously interacts with physical environment changes, converting input to output at a specific speed.
*   **Timeliness:** The time taken to convert input to output must be within a very short, allowable range.
*   **Concurrency:** Able to process input generated by multiple simultaneous physical environmental changes.
*   **Heterogeneity:** Effectively processes data originating from diverse hardware or software sources.
*   **Liveness:** Must never stop operating, even when unexpected events occur.
*   **Resource & Environmental Constraints:** Must operate within limits of CPU speed, memory size, user interface, power supply, and protocol compatibility.

## 4. Embedded Operating Systems (OS)

### A) Concept of Embedded OS

*   **Definition:** An operating system specifically optimized to run application programs on a computer system performing dedicated functions, typically for controlling a machine or other systems.
*   **Purpose:** Optimized for specific hardware with a built-in microprocessor to achieve predefined objectives.
*   **Evolution:** Early embedded systems directly controlled hardware using assembly language without a separate OS. However, as applications diversified, the need for an OS grew.

### B) Embedded OS Structure

An embedded OS is designed to support stable application execution even with low-specification processors, limited memory/storage, and challenging operating environments. It typically has a layered structure:

*   **User Level:**
    *   **User Process:** The applications or programs that users interact with.
    *   **Minimum Capacity Standard Library:** Basic functions and services available to user processes.
    *   **System Call Interface:** The bridge allowing user processes to request services from the kernel.

*   **Kernel Level:**
    *   **Process Scheduling:** Manages the execution order and allocation of processor time to different processes.
    *   **Processor Management:** Oversees the CPU's operation.
    *   **IPC (Inter-Process Communication):** Mechanisms for different processes to communicate and synchronize.
    *   **Memory Management:** Allocates and manages memory resources for processes.
    *   **Device Driver (Hardware Control):** Software components that allow the OS to interact with specific hardware devices.
    *   **System Call Interface:** The internal interface for the kernel to provide services.

*   **Hardware Level:**
    *   The physical components (CPU, memory, I/O devices) that the OS manages and interacts with via device drivers.

02 Embedded  Hardware
A) Microprocessor,  the key to embedded  systems
An embedded  system can handle more functions  and performance  because  the processor  provides  the performance
required  to drive the device. Early microprocessor  units (IMPUs) were made in a single chip, in which registers  data
processing,  arithmetic  logic unit (ALU) for mathematical  operation,  and flags for storing  result values were integrated
into a chip. Although  CPU and MPU were separated  according  to use and purpose in the past, the boundaries  now
are somewhat  ambiguous.  Since then, microcontrollers,  with a built-in processor,  memory,  and control interface  on a
single chip, have emerged  to be used for real-time  operating  systems  or automatic  controls.
It is not far-fetched  to consider  that the MPU is included in all the electronic  devices that are open to user
intervention  in its use or configuration.  It is currently  used in smartphones,  smart bands, and tablet PCs that are used
