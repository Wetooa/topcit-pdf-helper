## Learning Guide: Software Development Fundamentals

This guide covers core concepts in software development, focusing on the Spring Framework, e-Government Framework, development environments, and key development practices.

---

### 1. The Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is a popular Java framework designed to simplify enterprise application development.

**Key Components of Spring:**

*   **Spring Core:** The foundation. Provides the **IoC (Inversion of Control) container** (via `BeanFactory`) to manage object dependencies and separate configuration from functionality.
*   **Spring Context:** Provides ways to access objects (called "beans") managed by Spring.
*   **Spring DAO (Data Access Object):** Offers an abstraction layer for JDBC, improves transaction management, and integrates with ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks.
*   **Spring ORM:** Supports integration with various ORM tools like JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis, helping map objects to relational databases.
*   **Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming):** Helps separate "cross-cutting concerns" (like logging, security, transactions) from core business logic, improving maintainability.
*   **Spring Web:** Provides basic functions for general web applications and integrates with other web frameworks (e.g., WebWork, Struts).
*   **Spring WebMVC:** A Spring-specific implementation of common web application functions, similar to Struts.

### 2. Standard e-Government Framework

This framework is specifically designed for public projects in Korea to standardize Java-based system development.

**2.1. Concept & Purpose:**

*   **What it is:** A standardized framework providing basic functions, environments (execution, development, management, operation), and common modules for Java-based e-Government systems.
*   **Goal:** To standardize application software for public projects, improving quality and reusability.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improves e-Government service quality.
    *   Increases efficiency of investment in IT.
    *   Ensures fair competition among businesses by using a common development base.

**2.2. Key Characteristics:**

*   **Compliance with Open Standards:** Uses open-source technology to avoid dependence on specific vendors.
*   **Linkage with Commercial Solutions:** Provides standards for interoperability with various commercial software.
*   **National Standardization:** Development standards are set at a national level through public-private advisory committees.
*   **Easy Change/Replacement:** Components are modularized and linked via interfaces, minimizing the impact of changes.

**2.3. Framework Composition:**

The framework provides an application architecture, basic functions, and common components across several environments:

*   **Execution Environment:** Supports standardized development of screens, server logic, data processing, and batch functions for e-Government programs.
*   **Development Environment:** Provides tools for developing business programs (e.g., data development tools, test automation, code testing, project templates).
*   **Operating Environment:** Manages and operates services running in the execution environment (e.g., monitoring, deployment, batch execution, scheduling).
*   **Management Environment:** Facilitates distribution and management of the framework and common services to individual development projects.
*   **Common Components:** A collection of reusable development components for e-Government projects.

### 3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is a single software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

**3.1. Concept:**

*   **Purpose:** Combines various development tasks (coding, debugging, compilation, distribution) into one interactive interface.
*   **Advantage:** Replaces separate tools (text editor, compiler, debugger) with an all-in-one solution.
*   **Examples:** Visual Studio, Eclipse, Xcode.

**3.2. Core Components of an IDE:**

*   **Editor:** For writing and editing code.
*   **Build Tool:** Converts source code into machine-readable code (includes compilers, interpreters, linkers).
*   **Debugger:** Helps find and fix errors during program execution.
*   **Project Management:** Tools for organizing projects and supporting team collaboration.

---

### 4. Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is a core practice in modern software development focused on frequent code integration.

**4.1. Concept:**

*   **Process:** Developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository.
*   **Automation:** Each merge triggers an automated build and test process.
*   **Frequency:** Codes are merged multiple times a day (at least once daily) after quick error checks.
*   **Goal:** To maintain continuous quality control, minimize integration issues, and accelerate software improvement and delivery.

**4.2. Necessity of CI:**

*   Manages build configurations effectively.
*   Allows developers to focus solely on coding tasks.
*   Detects and resolves code integration problems early.
*   Supports agile methodologies by enabling frequent feedback and deployment.

**4.3. CI Server Requirements:**

To implement CI, a CI server needs:
*   At least one accessible source code repository.
*   A set of build scripts and procedures.
*   A test suite for the generated software artifacts.

### 5. Software Development Lifecycle Activities

These are practical steps in creating and managing software.

**5.1. Software Build:**

*   **Definition:** The process of converting source code files into independent, executable software artifacts.
*   **Purpose (Quality Assurance):**
    *   Reduces integration risks.
    *   Prevents quality deterioration.
    *   Helps monitor initial fault analysis.
    *   Boosts developer morale.

**5.2. Daily Build and Operation Test:**

*   **Process:** Compiling the entire software product daily and running a series of tests to confirm basic functionality.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Increases project efficiency and customer satisfaction.
    *   Reduces risks like integration failures, poor quality, and low project visibility.
    *   Saves time.
*   **Applicability:** Useful for all project sizes and types (large, small, commercial, business systems).

**5.3. Software Deployment:**

*   **Definition:** The set of activities involved in preparing a software system for use. The specific procedures vary based on the software and user requirements.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Release (making available)
    *   Installation & Activation (setting up and starting)
    *   Deactivation & Uninstallation (stopping and removing)
    *   Update & Built-in Update (applying changes)
    *   Version Tracking (monitoring changes)
    *   Retirement (ending service)

### 6. Current Trends & Future Topics

**6.1. Emphasis on Software Testing:**

*   There's a growing investment in time, money, and effort for software testing.
*   IT companies increasingly form dedicated QA (Quality Assurance) teams or departments.

**6.2. Upcoming Learning Objectives:**

*   Understanding testing concepts and test case design methods.
*   Describing different test levels (types) and their purposes.
*   Explaining software refactoring and its main activities.

**6.3. Key Terms to Know:**

*   Testing process, testing type
*   Specification-based technique, structure-based technique, experience-based technique
*   White box testing, black box testing
*   Software code smell, refactoring
