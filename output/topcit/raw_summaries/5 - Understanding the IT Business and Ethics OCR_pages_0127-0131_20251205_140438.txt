### **1. Disruptive Innovation**

Disruptive innovation involves introducing new products or services that challenge existing markets by targeting underserved customers or creating entirely new customer segments.

**1.1 Types of Disruptive Innovation:**

*   **New Market Disruption:**
    *   **Targets:** Non-customers who reject existing products or dissatisfied customers.
    *   **Strategy:** Launches innovative products using new technologies, focusing on niche segments.
    *   **Characteristics:** Low-feature, simple, convenient, low-priced, often mass-produced in smaller volumes. Makes products affordable or accessible to those who couldn't purchase before.
*   **Low-End Disruptive Innovation:**
    *   **Targets:** Customers who are "overserved" by existing, expensive products.
    *   **Strategy:** Leverages new processes and financial approaches (e.g., low margins, high resource utilization) to offer discounted prices.

**1.2 The Smartphone as an Example of Disruptive Innovation:**

*   **Market Shift:** Transformed the industry from voice-centered to data-serviced, and from hardware-centered to platform-based.
*   **Market Disruption:** Decimated markets for MP3 players, digital cameras, game consoles, car navigation, and tablet PCs.
*   **New Market Creation:** Spawned new markets and business models like app stores, location-based services, social networks (SNS), social commerce, social games, Big Data, and smart services.

**1.3 Key Technologies Driving Disruptive Innovation:**

### **2. Crowdsourcing**

**2.1 Definition:**

*   A combination of 'crowd' and 'outsourcing'.
*   Opening up an enterprise's operations (including R&D, problem-solving, product development) to participation from consumers and the general public.
*   Profits/revenues are shared with participants if the company's activities or revenues improve.

**2.2 How it Works:**

*   Leverages social networks and communication channels to generate ideas from a large group of people (the "masses").
*   **Business Model:** Companies post problems/tasks online; the crowd (specialists, scientists, public) provides solutions; compensation is given to successful solution providers.

**2.3 Benefits:**

*   Generates creative ideas for enterprise issues.
*   Reduces time and labor costs.
*   Provides insights into consumer needs in a rapidly changing market.
*   Helps ascertain demand for products/services through early adopter feedback.

**2.4 Example:**

*   Dell Computers collected 10,000 ideas in 18 months by creating a blog for consumers to exchange business-related technologies.

---

### **3. Open Innovation**

**3.1 Definition:**

*   An enterprise innovation method where the research, development, and productization processes are opened up to outside experts.
*   Outside experts share their ideas and knowledge.

**3.2 Purpose:**

*   Reduce costs.
*   Increase the likelihood of innovation success.

**3.3 Shift from Traditional R&D:**

| Feature         | Traditional R&D                                       | Open Innovation                                                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**    | Internal focus; augmenting R&D manpower and tech; kept development output sealed. | Collaboration with outside experts, institutions, organizations with core capabilities.                              |
| **Limitations** | Slow response to market; difficulty launching products on time; high investment, small success chance, increasing risks. | Leverages diverse external sources (venture companies, SMEs, research institutes, universities) to accelerate improvements. |
| **Value**       | Internal-driven value.                                | External connections create greater value, including licensing, spin-offs, new market entry.                       |

**3.4 Types of Open Innovation:**

*   **Inward Open Innovation:**
    *   **Focus:** Obtaining know-how or ideas *from* external sources.
    *   **Forms:** Technology purchase, joint research, sub-contracted research, establishment of joint ventures, venture investment, acquisition.
*   **Outward Open Innovation:**
    *   **Focus:** Sending internal knowledge or ideas *to* the outside world for commercialization through other business models.
    *   **Forms:** Technology sale, spin-off.

**3.5 Importance:**

*   Rapid IT advancements and convergence make it difficult for companies to keep pace with market changes through internal R&D alone.
*   Strengthens innovation capabilities and is crucial for company growth in a structurally transforming technological and business landscape.

ESSENCE
In new market disruption,  enterprises  target non-customers  who consciously  reject the products  in the market
or customers  who are dissatisfied  with existing  products.  By launching  innovative  new products  that utilize new
technologies,  the enterprises  try to build a presence  in niche segments  of the market  dominated  by existing  leading
companies.
In low-end  disruptive  innovation,  enterprises  target customers  who have been overserved  by leveraging  a new
process  and by employing  a financial  approach.  By using a combination  of low margin and high utilization  of resources,
enterprises  provide customers  with discounted  prices that are critical to succeeding  in the business.  In new market
disruptive  innovation,  enterprises  target non-consumers  who previously  could not afford to purchase  a product  or
who had no access to the technology  with low-feature  products  that are simple and convenient  to use. This is a
business  model in which enterprises  make money  with low-priced  products  that are mass produced  in small volumes,
The total takeover  of the mobile phone market  by smartphones  is a great illustration  of disruptive  innovation  at work.
The traditional  industry  shifted from a voice-centered  industry  to a data-serviced  industry  and from a hardware-
centered  (i.e. mobile terminal)  industry  to a platform-based  market  structure.  In addition,  if one examines  the impact
on other industry  sectors,  the high-performance  functions  installed  in smartphones  have obliterated  the markets  for
conventional  MP3, digital cameras,  game consoles,  car navigation  equipment,  and tablet PCs.
Smartphones  also created a variety of new markets  and business  models, including  app stores, location-based
services,  SNS, social commerce,  social games, Big Data, and smart  services.  Naturally,  there have to be some core
technologies  for such disruptive  innovations  to occur. Some of the latest technologies  driving disruptive innovations
that have recently  attracted  attention  include:

Disruptive  innovation  can be leveraged  as a strategy  for overcoming  the barriers to technological  innovation  and
reshape  future industries.  Enterprises  that are planning  disruptive  innovations  must clearly specify the target
technology  and its area of application,  and seek outside resources  in order to lay the foundations  for dominating
market  opportunities.
@ Crowdsourcing
As a composite  word coined by combining  ‘crowd’ and ‘outsourcing’,  crowdsourcing  is the concept  of opening  up all
phases of an enterprise’s  operations  to the participation  of consumers  and the general public alike. If the activities
of an enterprise  or its revenues  improve,  the revenue  is shared with the participants.  With the recent development
