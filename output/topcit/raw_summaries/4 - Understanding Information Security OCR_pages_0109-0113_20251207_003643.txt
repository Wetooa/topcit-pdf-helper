## Learning Guide: Understanding Information Security

### 1. Network Security Overview

#### A. Concept of Network Security
*   **Purpose:** To protect data transmission between computers from various threats.

#### B. Types of Security Attacks (X.800 Standard)

##### 1. Passive Attacks
*   **Goal:** Obtain and exploit system information without affecting system resources.
*   **Nature:** Eavesdropping or monitoring transmitted data.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Message Content Disclosure:** Reading the content of private messages.
    *   **Traffic Attack (Traffic Analysis):** Observing communication patterns (number, length of messages) to deduce information, even if data is encrypted.
*   **Detection:** Difficult because data isn't altered.
*   **Focus:** **Prevention** is key.

##### 2. Active Attacks
*   **Goal:** Change system resources and affect system operations.
*   **Nature:** Illegal modification of transmitted data or creation of false data.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Masquerading:** One entity pretends to be another (often combined with other attacks).
    *   **Replay Attack:** Capturing a legitimate message and re-sending it later to achieve unauthorized results.
    *   **Modification of Message:** Illegally altering parts of a message, delaying transmission, or changing message sequence.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:** Interfering with the normal use or management of communication equipment (e.g., making a server unavailable).
*   **Prevention:** Very difficult to prevent completely.
*   **Focus:** **Detection and recovery** from the attack's impact.

#### C. Network Security Model
*   **Purpose:** To describe how security measures protect data during transmission between sender and receiver.
*   **Key Elements of Security Mechanisms:**
    1.  **Security-Related Conversion:** Algorithms that transform data to protect it.
        *   **Examples:** Encryption (mixing messages to prevent understanding), adding a hash code (a unique code based on message content to identify the sender).
    2.  **Secret Information:** Confidential data known only to communicating parties, not to attackers.
        *   **Example:** Encryption keys used for converting messages.
*   **Trusted Third Party:** An entity that may be needed for secure transmission.
    *   **Roles:** Distributes secret information (like encryption keys) to communication parties, mediates disputes.
*   **Four Basic Conditions for Designing a Security Service:**
    1.  Design a robust security conversion algorithm that an attacker cannot break.
    2.  Create the necessary secret information for the algorithm.
    3.  Develop a secure method for distributing and sharing this secret information.
    4.  Designate a specific security algorithm and communication protocol for the entities using the secret information.

#### D. Network Access Security Model
*   **Threats:** Unauthorized infiltration (hackers), damage/theft of information, malware (viruses, worms).
*   **Two Categories of Security Response Techniques:**
    1.  **Gatekeeper Function:** Denies access to information systems for unauthorized users.
        *   **Example:** Login procedures using passwords.
    2.  **Internal Security Control:** Monitors and responds to activities *after* initial access by users or software.
        *   **Example:** **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** – a system that monitors information system activity to detect intruders or malicious behavior.

#### E. Communication Protocol Layer and Security
*   **OSI 7-Layer Reference Model:** A standard model (ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994) for how open systems interconnect, providing a framework to understand where security can be applied. (Specific security details for each layer are not covered in this section).

+ Preview  for practical  business Building  a secure network  using the
firewall and DMZ
Company  A is a small and medium-sized  company  that utilizes  a network  connected  to 90 computers.
Currently,  the company  has 126 public IP addresses  (211.82.50.0/25),  one router (211.82.50.126/25),
a switch, a database  server, and a web server, respectively.  In this situation,  assistant  manager,  Kim,
was instructed  to introduce  a firewall to configure  the external,  internal, and DMZ network,  in order
to increase  a network  security  level. Let’s learn how to build a secure network  under the following
conditions.
+ Set private IPs (192.168.1.0/24)  for 90 internal  PCs and the database  server.
+ Place the web server in the DMZ area, while keeping  the existing  address  (211.82.50.1/25).
+ Subnet  the external  network  and DMZ network  into two existing  IP bands (211.83.50.0/25).
+ Use only one router, one firewall,  and two switches.

01 Overview  of network  security
A) Concept  of network  security
@® Type of security  attacks
X.800 divides security  attacks into passive attacks and active attacks. A passive attack means that an
attempt  is made to obtain and exploit system information,  but system resources  are not affected.  An active
attack aims to change  system  resources  and affect system  operations.
+ Passive  attack
A passive attack refers to the eavesdropping  or monitoring  of transmitted  data and is attempted  to obtain
the transmitted  data. As shown in [Figure 53], passive  attacks  include message  content  disclosure  and traffic
attack. Traffic attacks  can also be made against  encrypted  data transmission  for confidentiality.  This attack
estimates  the nature of communication  by observing  the number  and length of message  exchanges.
The passive attack has the characteristic  that it is difficult  to detect, because  the attack does not change
data. Therefore,  prevention  is more important  than detection.

+ Active attack
An active attack can be classified  into masquerading,  replay, modification  of message,  and denial of service
(DOS) attack,  which entail the illegal modification  of transmitted  data or the creation  of false data.
Masquerading  occurs when one entity pretends  to be another. In general, the masquerading  attack is made
together  with one of the other active attack  types.
The replay attack acquires  one message,  by using an inactive  attack method,  and sends the message  again
to obtain unauthorized  results.

Information  security
The modification  of message  attack  obtains  unauthorized  results by illegallychanging  parts of legal messages,
delaying  message  transmission,  or changing  the message  sequence.
The denial-of-service  attack interferes  the normal use or management  of communication  equipment  (specific
computer  or network).  This attack is generally  called a DoS attack. Most of these attacks  are made against  a
specific  target.
The active attack has characteristics  that are opposite  to the passive attack. It is very difficult  to prevent
active attacks completely,  because  all communication  equipment  and communication  lines cannot be
physically  protected  at all times. Response  to active attacks  aims to detect an attack and recover  from the
collapse  or delay, due to such an attack.
