## IT Business & Ethics: Key Concepts

### 1. Cloud Computing

Cloud computing allows users to access shared IT resources over the internet, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

**1.1 Core Cloud Technologies**

*   **Cloud Client:** Technology for users to access cloud services (e.g., mobile apps, lightweight terminals).
*   **Cloud Service & Applications:** Software or applications provided as services.
*   **Cloud Platform:** Provides an environment for developing and running services.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Provides fundamental resources like servers, storage, and networks as services.

**1.2 Cloud Service Models (Based on IT Resource Nature)**

*   **SaaS (Software as a Service):**
    *   **Definition:** Users access applications via the internet/web browser without installing them.
    *   **Examples:** Google Gmail, MS Office 365.
*   **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
    *   **Definition:** Provides an environment (platform) for developers to build and run web applications. Requires modularized and standardized app development technologies.
    *   **Examples:** Salesforce.com's Force.com, Google App Engine.
*   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
    *   **Definition:** Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networks. Users can provision resources on demand.
    *   **Requirements:** Large data centers, capital, good electrical infrastructure.
    *   **Examples:** Amazon EC2 & S3, Gabia's cloud hosting.

**1.3 Cloud Deployment Models (Based on Configuration)**

*   **Public Cloud:**
    *   **Definition:** Services shared by multiple users over the internet. Managed by a cloud service provider.
*   **Private Cloud:**
    *   **Definition:** IT environment exclusively deployed on a company's/organization's intranet. Controlled by the company.
*   **Hybrid Cloud:**
    *   **Definition:** Combines public and private cloud services, offering scalability and flexibility for specific applications.

**1.4 Benefits of Cloud Computing**

*   Users can directly purchase, design, and install IT resources without IT manager intervention.
*   Improves efficiency by sharing IT resources.
*   Avoids costs associated with owning IT resources.
*   Enables new business models by merging with different services.

### 2. Virtualization

**2.1 Definition**
Virtualization is a technique to abstract computer resources. It hides physical resource characteristics, allowing:
*   Multiple logical resources from one physical resource.
*   A single logical resource from multiple physical resources.

**2.2 Types of Virtualization**

*   **Application Virtualization:** Users access applications instantly without local installation.
*   **Desktop Virtualization:**
    *   **Server-side:** Users get virtual desktops (e.g., Windows OS) from a central server.
    *   **Client-side:** Enables virtual desktops on individual PCs.
    *   **Benefit:** Separates personal and corporate workspaces.
*   **Server Virtualization:** Consolidates multiple physical server workloads onto fewer virtual servers, improving resource utilization, reducing rack costs, and administrative efforts.
*   **Storage Virtualization:**
    *   Uses **Thin-Provisioning** to allocate only the minimum required physical space initially.
    *   Integrates heterogeneous (different types of) storage systems into a unified environment.
*   **Network Virtualization:** Network hardware (switches, firewalls) are implemented as virtual machines, allowing virtual network operation within a single shared physical environment.

**2.3 Functions of Virtualization**

*   **Sharing:** Many virtual resources use one physical resource (e.g., Virtual Machines, Virtual LANs).
*   **Aggregation:** Virtual resources span multiple physical resources, increasing overall capacity and simplifying management (e.g., Storage virtualization).
*   **Emulation:** Virtual resources appear to have functions/characteristics they don't physically possess (e.g., virtual tape storage).
*   **Insulation (Transparent Change/Failure Proof):** Allows physical resources to be replaced without affecting virtual resources or users, preventing failures (e.g., RAID storage controller).

### 3. Blockchain Service

**3.1 Definition**
Blockchain is a distributed ledger network technology. It uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network where data blocks are stored and linked together in chains. It's the core technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

**3.2 Key Characteristics of Blockchain**

*   **Decentralized:** No central server. All network nodes work together to verify and guarantee data integrity.
*   **Improved Security:** Transactions are accepted only after consent from more than half of all network nodes.
*   **Transparency:** All nodes share their ledgers, making transaction records openly disclosed.
*   **Enhanced Safety (Self-Recovery):** The distributed nature allows the network to recover easily even if some nodes experience errors.
*   **Improved Economics:** Reduces centralized management costs and financial transaction costs due to the absence of a central server.
*   **Personal Data Protection:** Reduces risks of data collection, security breaches, or leaks associated with central systems.

**3.3 Blockchain Transaction Process**

1.  User A wants to transfer money to User B.
2.  Transaction data is generated as a "block."
3.  This block is shared with all participants on the network.
4.  Participants independently validate the transaction data (cross-validation).
5.  Once validated by the majority, the block is registered and added to the existing chain.
6.  The money transfer from A to B is complete.

**3.4 Immutability**
Because all nodes are involved in block creation and verification, and transactions require majority approval, it's virtually impossible to arbitrarily modify or manipulate transactions on a blockchain.

### 4. Smart Infrastructure

**4.1 Smart City**

*   **Definition:** An urban model that uses new technologies like ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and Big Data to solve urban problems and improve quality of life.
*   **Purpose:** Addresses challenges like aging infrastructure, energy shortages, environmental pollution, and crime.
*   **Key Technologies:** AI, Big Data, 5G mobile technologies.
*   **Service Areas:** Smart traffic, smart environment, public safety, public welfare, smart energy.
*   **Role:** A leading example of smart infrastructure.

**4.2 Smart Grid**

*   **Definition:** A next-generation power system that integrates IT with existing power grids. It monitors and controls power supply and demand in real-time to match production and consumption.
*   **Contrast with Traditional Power Systems:**
    *   **Traditional:** Centralized power generation; producers unilaterally supply power. Plants are built to meet estimated maximum consumption.
    *   **Smart Grid:** Decentralized control; optimizes power generation and consumption, making the system more efficient and responsive.

ESSENCE
- SaaS(Software  as a Service)
- PaaS(Platform  as a Service)
- laaS(Infrastructure  as a Service)
Saa& is a service that lets people use applications  through  the Internet  and web browser.  Saas is one of the top
tier services  that cloud service companies  can provide and leading services  include Google’s  Gmail and MS Office
365. PaaS is a service that lets companies  provide as a service, an environment  for developing  and running  web
applications.  In order to provide this kind of service, the technologies  for app development  must be modularized  and
standardized.  Leading  Paa include Salesforce.com's  Force.com and Google's  Google App Engine. laaS is principally
an enterprise  service that provides  a virtualized  environment  of resources  like servers, storages,  and networks  to
companies  who are permitted  to use the resources  whenever  needed. laaS service requires the ability to build and
operate  servers for large data centers,  capital, and a very good electrical  grid environment.  Examples  of laaS include
Amazon  EC2 and S3, as well as Gabia’s  cloud hosting  service.
Cloud service  can be divided into one of the following  categories,  depending  on how it is configured.
- Public Cloud
- Private  Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
A public cloud is a service shared by multiple  users over the Internet,  and a cloud service provider  provides the
services  and has management  responsibilities.  A private cloud is an IT environment  that is exclusively  deployed  on
a company’s  or an organization’s  intranet. It is controlled  by the company  or organization.  Hybrid cloud is a form of
cloud service that has scalability  and combines  the best of public cloud services  and private cloud services,  It can be
used in parallel  for special  purpose  applications.
With cloud computing,  users can directly  purchase,  design and install without  the need for intervention  by an IT
manager.  By sharing  IT resources  that could be used by everybody,  cloud computing  improves  efficiency  and the cost
associated  with owning IT resources  could be avoided. Due to these advantages,  cloud computing  can be merged
with different  types of services  and evolve into new business  models.
© Virtualization
Virtualization  is the abstraction  of computer  resources  on a computer  and it could be defined as "a technique  for
hiding  the characteristics  of physical  computer  resources  from the method  other systems,  applications,  and end users
use when they interact  with the resources” It is a technology  that can create multiple logical resources  from a single
physical  resource  or create a single logical resource  from multiple  physical  resources.
