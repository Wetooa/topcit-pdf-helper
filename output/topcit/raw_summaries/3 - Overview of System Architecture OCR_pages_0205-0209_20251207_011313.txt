## Learning Guide: Network Signaling & Multimedia Protocols

This guide covers key signaling, voice over IP (VoIP), and media transport protocols essential for modern network communication.

### 1. Resource Reservation & Priority

#### 1.1 RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol)
*   **Type:** IETF signaling protocol.
*   **Purpose:** Allocates static bandwidth for data flow end-to-end. Reserves queue space.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   **Path Message:** Sent from source to all receiving devices on the path, containing necessary information for receivers.
    *   **RESV Message:** Sent by receiver upstream towards the source, reserving router resources to support RSVP.
*   **Behavior without RSVP:** If a router on the path doesn't support RSVP, packets are delivered using the best-effort method (no guarantees).

#### 1.2 IP TOS Field (Type of Service)
*   **Location:** 1-byte field in an IP datagram.
*   **Purpose:** Determines packet processing priority.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Precedence (First Field):** Indicates priority/importance (higher number = higher priority).
    *   **TOS Fields:** Indicate network preferences for throughput, delay, reliability, or cost.
    *   **MBZ (Must Be Zero):** Unused field.
*   **Priority Levels:** Divided into 8 classes (0 to 7), with class 7 being the highest priority.
*   **Common TOS Field Values (4-bit binary):**
    *   `1000`: Priority on **delay minimization**
    *   `0100`: Priority on **processing volume** (throughput)
    *   `0010`: Priority on **reliability**
    *   `0001`: Priority on **cost minimization**
    *   `0000`: **General service**

### 2. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

#### 2.1 What is VoIP?
*   **Definition:** Communication technology enabling voice calls over IP networks using packet data.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Media Gateway:**
        *   Exchanges multimedia data.
        *   Delivers data to the corresponding network.
        *   Controlled by MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol).
    *   **Signaling Gateway:**
        *   Performs call signaling using protocols like H.323, SIP, MGCP, MEGACO.
        *   Converts signals between PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and IP networks for interoperability.

#### 2.2 VoIP Call Signaling Protocols

##### A) SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
*   **Type:** Application layer signaling protocol (RFC 3261).
*   **Purpose:** Establishes, modifies, and terminates multimedia communication sessions.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Used by intelligent terminals to identify, locate, and manage sessions.
    *   Independent of lower-layer transport protocols (can run over TCP/UDP).
    *   Scalable, text-based (similar to HTTP).
    *   Supports text-based addressing (URLs, E-mail format).
*   **Protocol Stack:** Operates over TCP/UDP, alongside RTP/RTCP.
*   **Core Components:**
    *   **SIP:** Defines the protocol.
    *   **SDP (Session Description Protocol):** Sets multimedia session parameters (RFC 4566/3264).
    *   **Audio Codecs (e.g., G.711A, G.723.1, G.729A):** For voice coding and system compatibility.
    *   **Video Codecs (e.g., H.263, MPEG-4, H.264):** For video coding.
    *   **RTP/RTCP:** For real-time media transport and control.
*   **Message Structure:**
    *   Uses SIP URI (like an email address) for user identification, independent of IP addresses.
    *   `START LINE`: Describes request method type and SIP URI.
    *   `HEADER`: Sets session control values.
    *   `BODY`: Contains content, type set in Content-Type.
    *   `CR/LF`: Blank space between HEADER and BODY.

##### B) H.323
*   **Type:** ITU-T standard.
*   **Purpose:** Provides voice, data, and video services over LANs, even those not guaranteeing quality.
*   **Advantage:** Widely used by startup VoIP providers because it allows multimedia services without changing existing network infrastructure.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Terminals:** End-user devices (telephones, fax machines, PCs with multimedia equipment).
    *   **Gatekeeper:**
        *   Converts between E.164 (PSTN numbers) and IP addresses.
        *   Performs call redirection and authentication.
        *   Manages components and bandwidth.
    *   **Gateway:** Performs logical connection mapping (encoding, protocol, call control) between different networks (e.g., IP, PSTN, ISDN, ATM).

---

### 3. VoLTE (Voice over LTE)

*   **Definition:** Technology providing data and voice services exclusively through the LTE network.
*   **Nature:** As LTE is an all-IP, data-only network, VoLTE voice services are implemented as digital data.
*   **Implementation:** Transmits voice, text, video chat, and multimedia content using SIP.
*   **Architecture:** Provides voice and text services (as data) through the **IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)**.
*   **Early Challenges:**
    *   Incomplete LTE infrastructure.
    *   Difficulty transmitting voice over existing WCDMA/GSM (3G) networks seamlessly.
    *   Lack of standard agreements for roaming and interconnection between LTE and 3G networks.
*   **Solutions/Evolution Steps:**
    1.  **Circuit-Switched Fallback (CSFB):** Initially, calls were established mainly over WCDMA/GSM circuit networks. LTE terminals and carriers performed minimal roaming. Multimedia communication was not supported at this stage.
    2.  **Evolution to Multimedia:** As LTE coverage expands, multimedia communication services are implemented through solutions like 3GPP MMTel (Multimedia Telephony).

---

### 4. Media Transport Protocols

#### A) RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)
*   **Purpose:** Designed to process and transmit real-time traffic (video/audio data) over the Internet.
*   **Transport Layer:** Operates over UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
*   **How it Works:** The transmitting side converts codec-compressed media into RTP packets and sends them via UDP.
*   **Guarantees:** Since it uses UDP, RTP does not guarantee packet delivery within a specified time or prevent loss. Applications rely on information in the RTP packet header to process packets.
*   **Standard:** Defined in IETF RFC 1889 (with RTCP).
*   **QoS & Sync:** RTCP is used to ensure QoS (Quality of Service) for RTP and synchronization of media streams.

#### B) RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol)
*   **Purpose:** Controls RTP for streaming video/audio over the Internet.
*   **Standard:** IETF standard, defined with RTP in RFC 1889.
*   **Packet Types:** Includes sender report, receiver report, source description message, bye message, and application-specific packets.

#### C) RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)
*   **Type:** Application layer protocol (IETF RFC 2326, 1998).
*   **Purpose:** Controls streaming media servers (e.g., for entertainment and communication systems).
*   **Functionality:** Its commands are similar to VCR operations (e.g., "PLAY", "PAUSE"). It accesses the server based on time information.
*   **Important Note:** RTSP establishes and controls media sessions between endpoints but *does not actually transmit the media streaming data itself*. Most RTSP servers use RTP for the actual audio/video data transfer.

#### D) IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)
*   **Origin:** First proposed by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) for wireless communication standards.
*   **Purpose:** Infrastructure for providing IP multimedia services.
*   **Core Technology:** Uses SIP protocol-based call control.
*   **Concept:** A communication platform defined by 3GPP to control multimedia sessions and provide IP-based services.

ESSENCE
RSVP is one of the IETF signaling  protocols,  and data flow is allocated  by a static bandwidth  by signaling  from end-to-
end. It basically  uses the method  of reserving  the queue space [2]. The RSVP message  starts from the source device
and is delivered  to all the receiving  devices  on the path. It is a path message  that contains  the necessary  information
for the receiver  and a message  sent by the receiver  upon receiving  the path message.  A RESV message  reserves  the
resource  of a router that moves toward the source device (upstream)  to support  RSVP. If a router on the path does
not support  RSVP, packets  are delivered,  based on the best-effort  delivery  method.
The priority method,  using the TOS field of IP datagram,  checks the 1-byte TOS field, as shown in [Figure 140], and
determines  the processing  priority, according  to the set value. The TOS class is divided into eight levels from class 0
to 7, and the higher the number,  the higher  the processing  priority.
Precedence,  the first field, indicates  the priority  or importance  of the packet,  and the TOS fields indicate  whether  the
network  maintains  a balance between  throughput,  delay, reliability,  and cost. The last MBZ (must be zero) field is a
field that is not currently  used.
The TOS field is expressed  as a 4-bit binary number.  <Table 73> shows the meaning  of each value.
(Table 73) TOS Field Values [4]
Binary  Value Meaning
1000 Priority  on delay minimization
0100 Priority  on processing  volume
0010 Priority  on reliability
0001 Priority  on cost minimization
0000 General  service
O2 Internet  Telephony  Concept  and Call Signal  Protocol
A) What is VoIP (Voice over Internet  Protocol)?
VoIP is a communication  technology  that facilitates  voice calls through  packet  data, based on the IP network. [Figure
142] shows the VoIP system structure.  The main service components  are the media gateway  and the signaling
gateway.  The media gateway  exchanges  multimedia  data, delivers  the changed  date to the corresponding  network,
and controls  it through  the media gateway  control protocol (MGCP).  The signaling  gateway  performs  call signaling,
using protocols,  such as H.323, SIP MGCP, and MEGACO,  and converts  the signals of the PSTN and IP networks, so
they can be used with each other.

B) VoIP call signal protocol
VoIP call signaling  protocols  include SIP (Session  Initiation  Protocol)  and H.323. The SIP protocol  is an application
layer signaling  protocol  that specifies  a procedure  for intelligent  terminals  that are communicating  on the Internet  in
order to identify  each other, find their locations,  and create or delete a multimedia  communication  session between
them. The H.323 protocol  is an ITU-T standard  for providing  voice, data, and video services  on a LAN that does not
guarantee  quality. Startup  VoIP service providers  use it widely because  it can provide multimedia  services  without
changing  the existing  network's  underlying  structure.
@ SIP
SIP is an application  layer signaling  protocol,  used to establish,  modify, and terminate  multimedia  sessions.  It operates
independently  of the lower-layer  transport  protocols  and has scalability  as an HTTP text-based  protocol.
It controls  sessions  to enable call control in a circuit-switched  data network  in a packet-switching  network  and
multimedia  applications  on the Intemet,  which is a packet network.  It can support  text-based  addressing  methods  in
URL and E-mail format  and message  parsing  or extension.
