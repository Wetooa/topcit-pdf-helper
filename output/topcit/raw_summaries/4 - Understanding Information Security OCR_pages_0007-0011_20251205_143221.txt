### UNIT 1: Core Information Security Concepts

#### 1. Cryptography Technology
*   **Cipher:** The core concept of encoding and decoding messages.

*   **Cryptographic Techniques:** Classification of various methods used for securing data.
*   **Cryptographic Algorithm & Cryptosystem:** Understanding the mathematical functions (algorithms) and the complete security system (cryptosystem) they operate within.
*   **Encryption Types:**
    *   **Private Key Encryption (Symmetric):** Uses a single, shared key for both encryption and decryption.
    *   **Public Key Cryptographic Algorithm (Asymmetric):** Uses a pair of keys – a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
*   **Hash Function:** A one-way function that transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, used for integrity verification.

#### 2. Authentication Technology
*   **Authentication Concept:** Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device.
*   **Authentication Methods:** Different ways to prove identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics, tokens).
*   **Authentication Technologies:** Tools and systems enabling authentication.
*   **Electronic Signature:** Digital data used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.
*   **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):** A system for creating, managing, distributing, and revoking digital certificates, crucial for public-key cryptography.

#### 3. Access Control Technology
*   **Access Control Overview & Policy:** Defining rules and mechanisms to restrict access to resources.
*   **Types of Access Control Policies:** Different strategies for granting or denying access (e.g., DAC, MAC, RBAC).

*   **Pharming:** Redirects users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones without their consent, typically through DNS poisoning.
*   **Phishing:** Deceptive attempts to acquire sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords, credit card details) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
*   **Smishing:** Phishing conducted via SMS messages.
*   **Spear Phishing:** Highly targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
*   **Cryptojacking:** Unauthorized use of a victim's computer to mine cryptocurrency.
*   **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts a victim's files, demanding a ransom payment for decryption.
*   **Drive-by Download Attack:** Malware automatically downloads to a user's device without their knowledge when visiting a compromised website.
*   **"Fileless" Attack:** Cyberattacks that operate entirely in memory, without installing any files on the system, making them harder to detect.
*   **Malvertising:** Using legitimate online advertising networks to spread malware.
