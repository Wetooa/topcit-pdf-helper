# Data Analytics & Big Data: Learning Guide

## 1. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

### 1.1 Concept of OLAP
*   **What it is:** A process where users directly access and interactively analyze multi-dimensional information for decision-making.
*   **How it works:** Users analyze operational data (extracted and converted by ETL) stored in data warehouses or data marts.
    *   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** A process for collecting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a destination system (like a data warehouse).

### 1.2 OLAP Search Techniques
OLAP offers various techniques to analyze data from diverse perspectives and summary levels:

*   **Drill Down:** Moves from a high summary level to a low (detailed) summary level.
    *   *Example:* Analyzing sales from Year > Month > Day.
*   **Roll Up:** Moves from a low (detailed) summary level to a high summary level.
    *   *Example:* Analyzing sales from Day > Month > Year.
*   **Drill Across:** Uses an analysis viewpoint from one topic to approach another analysis topic.
*   **Pivot:** Changes the axis or perspective of the analysis.
*   **Slice:** Creates a subset by selecting specific values for members at one level.
*   **Dice:** Creates a subset by slicing across more than two dimensions.

## 2. Data Mining

### 2.1 Concept of Data Mining
*   **What it is:** A series of processes to identify systematic statistical rules or patterns within large amounts of data.
*   **Purpose:** Converts patterns into meaningful information for corporate decision-making.

### 2.2 Data Mining Algorithms
*   **Association:**
    *   **Description:** Discovers patterns of highly relevant data combinations, often in transaction data.
    *   **Example Algorithm:** Apriori algorithm.
    *   **Uses:** Product placement in stores, recommending related products online.
*   **Sequence:**
    *   **Description:** Extends association analysis by adding the concept of time to find correlations of items over time. Forecasts future transactions based on history.
    *   **Example Algorithms:** Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP).
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Description:** Creates a tree-type model to categorize values of a specific attribute within a dataset.
    *   **Example Algorithm:** Decision tree algorithm.
*   **Clustering:**
    *   **Description:** Groups records (e.g., customers, products) with similar attributes together.
    *   **Example Algorithms:** K-Means algorithm, EM algorithm.

## 3. Big Data

### 3.1 Why Big Data Matters
*   **Increasing Demand:** Growing need for big data analytics and skilled professionals (engineers, data scientists).
*   **Limitations of Traditional Systems:** Existing database management systems (DBMS) struggle with the processing speed and performance required for tens of PBs of fast-generated, diverse, unstructured data (from multimedia, SNS, sensors, IoT).
*   **Emergence of New Solutions:** Development of technologies suitable for analyzing this large volume and variety of high-velocity data.
*   **NoSQL Adoption:** Non-relational databases (NoSQL) are increasingly used for unstructured and large-scale data due to their focus on fast processing (BASE characteristics). Understanding NoSQL is crucial as it differs from traditional relational databases.

### 3.2 Key Terms
*   Big data, 3V, unstructured data, Distributed File System (DFS), NoSQL, CAP theory.

### 3.3 Definition of Big Data
*   **General Definition:** Data that exceeds the capacity of traditional database management tools to capture, store, and analyze.
*   **Technology/Architecture:** Next-generation technologies and architectures designed to extract value from large-scale data efficiently, supporting rapid collection, discovery, and analysis.

### 3.4 Characteristics of Big Data (The 3 Vs)
Big data is defined by three core elements:

*   **Volume:**
    *   Refers to extremely large data quantities (tens of terabytes, petabytes, or more).
    *   Exceeds the processing limits of commonly used software.
*   **Velocity:**
    *   Data is generated and collected very quickly.
    *   Requires real-time or near-real-time processing, storage, and analysis.
*   **Variety:**
    *   Encompasses diverse kinds of data.
    *   Can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
*   ***Note:* Sometimes expanded to 6Vs:** Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity (data quality), Visualization (presenting data), Value (insights derived).

### 3.5 Data Types in Big Data
*   **Structured Data:**
    *   Data stored in a fixed, predefined field format (e.g., traditional relational databases).
*   **Semi-structured Data:**
    *   Data not stored in a fixed field but contains metadata or schema.
    *   *Examples:* XML, HTML, CSV, JSON, RDF.
*   **Unstructured Data:**
    *   Data that is not stored in any fixed field format.
    *   *Examples:* Documents, pictures, videos, audio data.

04 Concept  and Search  Technique  of OLAP (Online  Analytical
Processing)
A) Concept  of OLAP
OLAP refers to the process  by which the end user accesses  multi-dimensional  information  without  an intermediary  or
medium,  and then analyzes  the information  interactively  and uses it for decision  making.  That is, when the operational
data extracted and converted  by ETL are stored in the data warehouse  or data mart, the end user analyzes  them
using OLAP.
B) OLAP search  technique
OLAP provides  various search techniques  that allow end users to analyze data from diverse perspectives  and
summary  levels. The table below shows the main search techniques  of OLAP.

* Concept  opposite  to Drill Down
+ Asearch  technique  that approaches  a specific  analysis  topic in phases  from a low summary  level to
pole a high summary  level.
E.g. Time dimension:  Day r > month r > year
Drill Across + Asearch  technique  that uses a certain analysis  viewpoint  on one analysis  topic to approach  another  analysis  topic.
Pivot + Asearch  technique  that changes  the axis of the analysis perspective  on a specific analysis  topic.
Slice + Asearch  technique  that creates subsets  by selecting  specific  values for the members  at one level or
the members  above  that level.

05 Concept  and Algorithm  of Data Mining
Data mining refers to a series of processes  that identify  a systematic  statistical  rule or pattern  among  a large amount
of data, convert  it into meaningful  information, and apply it to corporate  decision-making.  The table below shows the

>> Recent  trends and major issues
It is essential  to understand  technologies  related to big data analytics  because  the social demand  for
big data analytics  and big data technicians  (engineers,  data scientists,  etc.) is increasing  significantly.
In addition,  NoSQL, which has the characteristics  of a BASE focusing  on the fast-processing  speed for
unstructured  data and large-scale  data, is increasingly  being adopted  in enterprises’  operating  environment.
Therefore,  it is necessary  to understand  NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as it is based on a different  concept  to
existing  relational  databases.

+ Preview  for practical  business Why do we need to understand  big data
technology?
Although  interest in data analysis has increased,  the existing  system architecture  and DBMS face
limitations  in terms of processing  speed and performance  when an existing  analysis  system  processes  tens
of PBs of unstructured  data generated  by multimedia,  SNS, sensors,  loT, etc., due to the advancement  of IT
technologies.  As a result, solutions  are being developed  that are suitable  for analyzing  the large volume  of
unstructured  data (variety)  generated  at high speed (velocity).  Technologies  related to big data, which was
still in its infancy  only a few years ago, have developed  rapidly and are now being used directly in our real
life.
There are many examples  of this. For...
