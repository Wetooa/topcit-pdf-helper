# Learning Guide: Embedded Software & System Architecture

## 1. Embedded Software

### A) Definition & Applications

*   **Definition:** Software installed in embedded systems. It's becoming more complex due to diverse applications.
*   **Main Technology Fields:**
    1.  **Basic Embedded Applications:** Multimedia players, map viewers, browsers, games, GPS/GIS (CNS).
    2.  **Embedded Middleware:** Software that connects different components. Examples:
        *   Distributed (CORBA, COM XML)
        *   Java (JVM, J2ME)
        *   Control (Jini, UPnP)
        *   Multimedia (streaming, codec)
        *   Communication (WLAN, WPAN)
    3.  **Embedded System Software:** OS, device drivers, communication protocols (wired/wireless), multimedia protocols, DBMS.
    4.  **Embedded System Development Tools:** Design tools, test tools, IDEs, simulators, cross compilers, remote monitors.
    5.  **Embedded Software Platforms:** Frameworks like MS .net compact framework, Sun ONE, Brew, WIPI.

### B) Characteristics of Embedded Software

Embedded software continuously interacts with its physical environment and user requirements. Key characteristics include:

*   **Reactivity:** Continuously interacts with environmental changes, converting input to output at a specific speed.
*   **Timeliness:** Input-to-output conversion time must be within a very short, allowable range.
*   **Concurrency:** Must process input data generated by simultaneous physical environmental changes.
*   **Heterogeneity:** Effectively processes data from various hardware or software sources.
*   **Liveness:** Must never stop operating, even after unexpected events.
*   **Resource & Environmental Constraints:** Must meet limits on CPU speed, memory, user interface, power supply, and protocol compatibility.
*   **Determinism:** (Not explicitly defined in the provided text, but implied by timeliness and reactivity; often refers to predictable execution).

## 2. Embedded Operating System (OS)

### A) Concept of Embedded OS

*   **Definition:** An operating system optimized for specific functions on a computer system with a built-in microprocessor, controlling machines or other systems.
*   **Evolution:** Early embedded systems used assembly language for direct hardware control without an OS. As applications diversified, the need for an OS increased.

### B) Structure & Applied Technology

*   **General Structure:** Supports stable application execution on systems with low-specification processors, limited memory/storage, and challenging operating environments.
    *   Key components typically include: User Processes, System Call Interface, Kernel Level (managing process scheduling, processor, IPC, memory), and Device Drivers (hardware control).
*   **Applied Technologies:**
    *   **Real-time Multitasking:** Ensures guaranteed and predictable real-time services through real-time scheduling, synchronization, and resource management.
    *   **Lightweight Kernel:** Provides a basic kernel suitable for resource-limited systems with specific application targets.
    *   **Power Management:** Systems designed for embedded devices, especially portable ones using small batteries.
    *   **Tiny Kernel:** Supports ultra-small/ultra-low-resource embedded systems, such as sensor networks.

### C) Types & Trends of Embedded OS

Embedded OSs are broadly categorized into two types:

1.  **Real-time OS (RTOS):**
    *   **Focus:** Controlling application programs or hardware within strict time limits.
    *   **Examples:** VxWorks, VRTX, QNX, pSOS.
    *   **Traditional Use:** Critical systems like satellites and missile controllers where flawless, time-bound operation is essential.

2.  **Non-real-time OS:**
    *   **Focus:** Development convenience, scalability, and diverse operating environments.
    *   **Examples:** Linux series, embedded Windows XP, Windows CE.

*   **Current Trends:**
    *   **Growing Dominance of Linux & Free RTOS:** Increasingly replacing traditional commercial RTOS in many embedded applications.
        *   Linux is widely adopted (e.g., ~65% of embedded devices, growing rapidly).
        *   FreeRTOS is expanding quickly and becoming a de-facto standard (e.g., ~50% market share).
        *   Other rapidly spreading options include ARM's mbed.
    *   **Commercial Products Remain in Safety-Critical Areas:** Markets requiring high safety standards (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railways) still primarily use commercial RTOS products.

## 3. Recent Trends & Issues in Information System Infrastructure

Information system infrastructure is crucial for business efficiency and customer service.

*   **Components:** Hardware, software, and human resources.
*   **Modern Trend:** Many information systems now adopt web-based structures.
*   **Challenges in Traditional Implementation:**
    *   Information systems are often built by separately purchasing servers, storage, and network devices from different vendors, then integrating them.
    *   Software is also bought separately, requiring extensive testing for hardware compatibility.
    *   This complex process leads to inefficiencies in construction time and system management.
*   **Solutions for Efficiency:**
    *   **Converged Infrastructure (CI):** Integrates hardware (storage, servers, networks) with virtualization solutions and management software into a pre-validated product supplied to customers.
    *   **Hyper-converged Infrastructure (HCI):** A newer approach that further complements CI, often by addressing high investment costs and simplifying management even more.
*   **Overall Goal:** Continuous efforts are being made to increase the efficiency of information system implementation.

03 Embedded  Software
A) Definition  of embedded  software  and technology  application
Embedded  software  refers to software  installed  in embedded  systems.  As the application  fields of embedded  systems
diversify,  embedded  software  is becoming  increasingly  complex  to handle  various  functions.
As shown in <Table 20>,
applications,  embeddedthe main technology  fields of embedded  software  can be classified  into basic embedded
middleware,  embedded  system software,  embedded  system development  tools, and
embedded  software  platforms.

B) Characteristics  of embedded  software
Embedded  software  is embedded  in a physical product  and continuously interacts  with the physical  environment.
In other words, it must continuously  receive and process signals from the physical  environment.  In some cases,
it is necessary  to receive the user’s requirements  and respond  to them, by considering  changes  in the physical
environment.  There are also cases, such as computers  and smartphones,  where it only responds  to user requirements.
Therefore,  embedded  software  has characteristics,  such as reactivity,  timeliness,  concurrency,  heterogeneity,  liveness,
resource  and environmental  constraints,  and determinism.  <Table 21> below shows features  of each characteristic.
{Table 21) Characteristics  of Embedded  Software
Technology  Application Example
Embedded  software  should continuously  interact  with physical  environmental  changes,  by
REEEBUBY converting  input data into output data at a specific speed.
Timeliness The time required  to convert  input data into output  data should be within the very short allowable
range.
Embedded  software  should be able to process  input data, generated  by the concurrent  physicalConcurrency -environmental  changes.
Heterogeneity Embedded  software  should effectively  process  data from hardware  or software.

Liveness Embedded  software  should never stop its operation,  even after unexpected  events.
Resource  and Embedded  software  should meet the resource  (CPU processing  speed, memory  size, and user
environmental  constraints  | interface)  and environmental  (power  supply  and protocol  compatibility)  constraints.
04 Embedded  OS
A) Concept  of embedded  OS
An embedded  OS is an operating  system that is optimized  to execute  the application  programs  running  on a
computer  system that perform specific functions  for controlling a  machine  or other systems.  It is optimized  for a
specific  system  that has hardware  with a built-in  microprocessor,  and it performs  set purposes.  In the early embedded
systems,  the hardware  was directly  controlled  using the assembly  language,  and it operated  without  a separate  OS.
However,  as the embedded  system applications  have diversified, the need to use an OS has increased,
B) Embedded  OS structure  and applied  technology
As shown in [Figure 73], an embedded  OS generally  has a structure  to support the stable application  program
execution  with a low-specification  processor,  a limited memory  and storage  device, and poor operating  environment
conditions.
