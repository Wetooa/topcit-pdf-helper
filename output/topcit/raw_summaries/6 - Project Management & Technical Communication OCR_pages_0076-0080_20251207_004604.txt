## Project Management and Technical Communication: A Study Guide

### 1. Introduction to Project Management

**Key Trends & Principles:**
*   Project management processes must be adapted to the specific environment and conditions of each project.
*   Understanding and applying **Agile processes** is crucial in modern project management.

**Core Concepts Summary:**
*   **Project Life Cycles:** Predictive, Iterative, Adaptive.
*   **Project Management Process Groups:** Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing.
*   **Project Management Methodologies:** PMBOK, ISO21500, PRINCE2.
*   **Agile Process Types:** Scrum, XP (eXtreme Programming), Kanban, Lean.
*   **Agile Process Execution Methods:** Backlog, Burndown Chart, Scrum Master, Sprint, Retrospective, Daily Meeting.

**Organizational Influence:**
*   Project management methodologies and processes are shaped by a company's organizational structure and application methods.

**Agile vs. Waterfall (Brief Overview):**
*   **Waterfall Methodology:** A classical, planning-focused model that proceeds in a single, linear sequence. It can be adapted to iterative or adaptive cycles through overlapping or repetition.
*   **Agile Methodology:** A value-oriented approach that emphasizes flexibility and quick response to change.
    *   **Scrum:** A specific Agile framework that boosts productivity through active cooperation and communication, rather than strict formalities.
*   **Challenges with Agile:** Difficult to apply in highly vertical organizational structures or where there are significant power imbalances (e.g., between client and supplier).

### 2. The Project Life Cycle

**Overview:**
*   A project's life cycle is the period from its initiation to its closing.
*   It typically involves five distinct process groups. If a project stops mid-way, the closing process is initiated immediately.

**The Five Project Management Process Groups:**

1.  **Initiating Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Formally starting the project.
    *   **Activities:** Formal project initiation, stakeholder identification, project manager appointment, project charter development.
2.  **Planning Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Defining how project goals will be achieved and deliverables created.
    *   **Activities:** All activities involved in planning to meet project objectives.
3.  **Executing Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Carrying out the work defined in the project management plan.
    *   **Activities:** Completing the tasks outlined in the project plan.
4.  **Monitoring & Controlling Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Tracking project performance and progress, making adjustments as needed.
    *   **Activities:** Continuous oversight throughout the project life cycle, ensuring alignment with the plan and making corrective actions.
5.  **Closing Process Group:**
    *   **Purpose:** Formally completing all project activities.
    *   **Activities:** Finalizing all tasks, including contractual obligations, to officially close the project.

**Project Life Cycle Management (PLCM):**
*   Approaches project management using a **systems engineering model**.
*   Involves dividing the project life cycle into detailed stages.
*   Systematically manages **inputs, technologies, tools, and outputs** for each stage to facilitate overall project management.
*   **Life Cycle:** Describes the general steps.
*   **Methodology:** Provides concrete specifications (inputs, tools, outputs) for each step.

**Types of Project Life Cycles:**

1.  **Predictive Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Planning-focused. Project scope, schedule, and cost are largely determined at the project's beginning based on past experience.
    *   **Application:** Suited for projects with established technology or extensive experience, like product development or architectural projects.
    *   **Process:** The entire project scope is defined at the start, and execution follows a pre-defined plan.

2.  **Iterative Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** The final product is developed by dividing it into parts and repeatedly developing those parts.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Incremental Life Cycle:** Project scope is broken into multiple phases. Activities within these phases run in parallel, overlapping and repeating, delivering functional parts of the product gradually.
        *   **Evolutionary Life Cycle:** The project is divided into phases, with each iteration building upon and refining the previous one sequentially towards the final product.

3.  **Adaptive Life Cycle:**
    *   **Characteristics:** An **Agile process** designed to react quickly to external changes.
    *   **Purpose:** To flexibly respond to evolving requirements, maximizing project value in dynamic environments.

### 3. Project Planning and Initiation (Before Contract)

**Stages Before Project Contract and Commencement:**
1.  **Planning Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Preliminary work such as feasibility analysis and budget planning for the project.
2.  **Acquisition Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Defining the project scope, preparing and issuing a **Request For Proposal (RFP)** to potential vendors, and optionally holding an RFP briefing.
3.  **Contracting Stage:**
    *   **Activities:** Evaluating submitted proposals, selecting a business operator, conducting technical negotiations, and finalizing the contract.

**Key Considerations for New Project Planning:**
*   Ensure the project or program aligns with the organization's enterprise-wide strategic goals and portfolio.
*   Review the high-level plan for integration with any relevant existing management programs.

**Importance of Early Planning (Project Cost/Efforts Curve):**
*   **Crucial Principle:** Spending sufficient time on planning in the early stages helps avoid significant confusion and problems later in the project.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Allows prediction of various risks and issues.
    *   Enables establishing response plans in advance.
    *   Sets up processes for handling unexpected problems effectively.
*   **Consequences of Poor Planning:** Neglecting initial planning and rushing into execution can lead to rapid progress at first, but exponentially increasing confusion and potential project failure in later stages.

**The Proposal Process (Developer's Perspective):**
*   **Proposal:** A document submitted by a potential supplier (developer) to a client (acquirer) in response to an RFP.
*   **Purpose:** To win the project contract.
*   **Content:** Typically includes a proposal outline, introduction to the proposing company, and details on project execution and management.
*   **Outcome:** After proposal evaluation, if selected as the preferred bidder, a contract is concluded through technical negotiation, and the project officially begins.

>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
Project management  process  cannot be applied to all projects in a uniform manner. Appropriate
project lifecycle  and management  processes  should be applied according  to the environment
and conditions  of the project. It is important  to develop  the ability to understand  and apply agile
processes  that are actively  applied recently.

Project management  methodologies  and processes  are influenced  by the organizational  structure  or
application  method  of the company.
The Waterfall  methodology  is a classical  model to perform a project with one single sequence  and
can develop  into an iterative  or adaptive  life cycle through  overlapping  or repetition  of the sequence.
If the Waterfall  methodology  is based on planning,  Agile is a value-oriented  methodology.  Scrum
improves  project  productivity  through  active cooperation  and communication  between  people rather
than formalities.
In the domestic  development  environment,  there are cases where it is difficult  to apply Agile
methodology  in a vertical  structure  or a power imbalanced  relationship  between  the acquirer  and the
supplier.
01 Project  Life Cycle
A) Project  life cycle
A project has a certain cycle, which is generally composed  of five processes:  initiating,  planning,  executing,
monitoring  and controlling,  and closing, and if the project is stopped  in the middle, the closing process  is im-
mediately  executed.

The life cycle is the period from when a service or product  is released  until it is no longer used or retired from
the market. The life cycle of a project refers to the period from initiating,  planning,  executing,  monitoring  and
controlling,  and closing  of the project.
Project  life cycle management  is to approach  project management  in the systems  engineering  model. It is to
facilitate  the management  of the entire project by dividing  the life cycle into detailed stages, and system-
atically managing  inputs, technologies,  tools, and outputs  for each stage. The life cycle simply describes  the
whole process  by each step to prepare  the basis for the systems  engineering  approach,  and the methodology
is a concrete  specification  of inputs, technologies,  tools and outputs  for each step.
The predictive  life cycle is a planning-focused  life cycle, and it is determined  at the beginning  of the project
as knowledge  about the project scope, schedule,  and cost is accumulated  empirically.  It is mainly applied to

product  development  and architectural  projects  with much accumulated  technology  or experience.  It is a cycle
in which the entire scope of the project  is defined  at the initiating  stage and the schedule  and cost are carried
out according  to the plan.
