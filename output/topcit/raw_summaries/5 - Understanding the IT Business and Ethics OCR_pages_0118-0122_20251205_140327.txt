### **2. Key Performance Indicators (KPI)**

#### **A) Overview of KPI**

*   **Definition:** A quantifiable indicator that measures achievement of a goal and contains a Critical Success Factor (CSF).
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Accurately reflect organizational goals.
    *   Selected from elements critical to realizing goals.
    *   Determine success in competition and strategy.
*   **Importance:** Widely used in performance evaluations; influences employee behavior.

#### **B) KPI Establishment Procedure**

KPIs should align with organizational vision and objectives, act as strategic drivers, and provide organization-wide guidance.

1.  **Define KPI Area:**
    *   Specify characteristics of the organization/operational unit.
    *   Select participants.
    *   *Output:* KPI establishment plan, organizational chart.

2.  **Collect Data:**
    *   Collect and review vital documents.
    *   Develop interview questions and execute interviews.
    *   *Output:* Interview questionnaire, KPI portfolio.

3.  **Analyze:**
    *   Create activity description sheets.
    *   Analyze affinity (relationships).
    *   Develop topics.
    *   *Output:* Job-KPI affinity analysis chart.

4.  **Derive KPIs:**
    *   Derive the initial KPIs.
    *   Refine, classify, and integrate them.
    *   *Output:* KPI list, KPI derivation.

5.  **Verify KPIs:**
    *   Establish criteria for comparison.
    *   Develop a comparison matrix.
    *   Compare associative relations.
    *   Set targets.
    *   *Output:* KPI verification matrix.

#### **C) Precautions for Deriving KPIs**

1.  **Top Management Support:** KPIs require strategic support from top management to ensure they reflect the organization's strategic vision. Don't delegate solely to middle management.
2.  **Don't Imitate:** KPIs must be unique to your enterprise, matching its specific goals and strategies. A great company's KPIs might not work for another.
3.  **Continuous Improvement:** KPI derivation is an ongoing process. Start with a balanced set, evolve them gradually, and be prepared to modify them to respond to business environment changes.

### **3. Goal Management System (MBO)**

#### **A) Key Perspectives of MBO**

*   **Definition:** Management by Objective (MBO) is a system for managing organizational goals. It's a business management technique for setting, controlling, and managing goals to improve individual performance and capabilities.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Employees set their own quantitatively measurable goals.
    *   Goals are set in a "bottom-up" fashion, then finalized through discussions with supervisors to align with enterprise goals.
    *   Meeting individual goals positively contributes to achieving corporate goals.

#### **B) Main Reasons for Adopting MBO**

| Reason                 | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal Alignment**     | Systematically links overall enterprise goals with individual goals to improve both individual and enterprise performance.                                 |
| **Motivation Driver**  | Employees are motivated by voluntarily and creatively setting and working towards their goals, contributing to enterprise goal achievement.                  |
| **Organizational Integration** | Develops employee abilities and improves job performance, creating a unified direction for all employees. |

*   **Caution:** MBO goals may not align with enterprise goals if guidelines are absent. Also, conflicting individual goals can lead to disputes. Careful implementation is crucial.

#### **C) Component Elements of MBO**

| Component Element  | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setting Objectives** | Objectives must be: <br/>- Measurable, specific, and achievable. <br/>- Established in a direction that allows for continuous yearly improvement. <br/>- Within the organization's overall goals and capabilities. |
| **Participation**  | Encourages interaction among employees (especially supervisors and subordinates) during goal setting and execution to align with enterprise strategies.                 |
| **Feedback**       | Requires continuous feedback (evaluations and encouragement) throughout the evaluation period to help employees continuously improve their performance.                 |

### **4. Recent IT Business Trends and Key Issues**

*   **Rapid Transformation:** The IT business environment is rapidly changing, driven by smart mobile technology.
*   **IT as a Business Core:** IT is no longer just a support function; it now leads business as the core service in many new business models.
*   **Accelerated Transformation:** The combination of mobile, open-source, and social services with infrastructure like cloud, big data, IoT, and AI is accelerating business environment transformation.

#### **Learning Objectives:**

relationships  exist among the indicators  within a structure  where results are shared. IT-BSC and BSC not only help
managers  to make decisions,  but also provide a balanced  view of performance  evaluation  in the IT sector because
they are ultimately  linked to the financial  indicators.

0S Management  of the Key Performance  Indicators
A) Overview  of KPI
KPI stands for key performance  indicator  and is a quantifiable  indicator  that contains  the critical success  factor (CSF)
of an organization.  The KPI is used to measure  the achievement  of a goal. Therefore,  KPIs must accurately  reflect
the goals of the organization  and they must be selected  from among  the elements  that are critical to realizing  those
goals, KPls are the factors  (means  or determinants)  that could determine  victory  in competition  as well as the factors
(ends or results)  related to the success  of the selected  strategy.  Generally  set by the organization  and its employees,
KPls are important  indicators  that are widely used in performance  evaluations.  Therefore,  depending  on which KPIs are
selected,  the employees  could start behaving  differently  at work.
B) KPI establishment  procedure
The right KPIs should be compatible  with the vision and objectives  of the organization,  should  function  as strategic
drivers,  and should allow the members  of the organization  to move forward  in accordance  with the same purpose  and
strategy.  Therefore,  KPls should be able to provide  guidance  for the entire organization,  and should not be limited to
specific  areas. The derived KPls should be made to match the strategy  and goals of the organization  after undergoing
a validation  process.

C) Precautions  to take when deriving  KPI
@ KPls need the strategic  support  of top management
KPls should be kept separate  from legacy processes  and instituted  as an internal  process  that could lead to the best
performance  from the organization  as a whole. The task of managing  the KPls should not be delegated  to a task
force composed  of middle-level  managers:  rather, it should be the responsibility  of the top management,  who must
make sure the strategic  vision of the organization,  is reflected  in the KPIs.
@ Use a reference  model but do not imitate it!
Even a set of KPls from a great company  is of no use to another  enterprise  because  the goals and strategies  are
different  for each enterprise.  Therefore,  an enterprise  must develop  its own KPI which matches  its strategies.
@® KPI derivation  is a process  of making  continuous  improvements.
Starting  with a balanced  set of KPls, the KPIs should be derived in gradual steps so as to allow them to evolve into
a mature set of KPIs. It must be possible  to modify  a set of KPIs in order to allow enterprises  to respond  promptly  to
changes  in the business  environment.
06 Goal Management  System
A) Key perspectives  of MBO
MBO (Management  by Objective)  is a system for managing  the goals of an organization.  MBO is also a business
management  technique  for setting  goals and controlling/managing  the path to meeting  those goals for the purpose
of improving  individual  performances  and capabilities.
