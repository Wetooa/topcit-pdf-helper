## Learning Guide: Understanding Information Security

### 1. Introduction to Information Security

**Subject:** Understanding the fundamental concepts of information security.

**Why it's important:**
*   Rapid advancements in IT (Cloud, Big Data, AI, IoT) lead to new technologies and services.
*   Security technology often lags behind, increasing the risk of security breaches involving new tech.
*   Urgent need to develop and apply security measures for modern technologies.

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Explain the concept of information security.
*   Explain the goals and importance of information security.

**Keywords:**
Information Security, Administrative Security, Technical Security, Physical Security, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-repudiation, Authentication, Access Control.

### 2. Overview of Information Security

**A. Concept of Information Security**
*   **Definition:** Protecting information (administratively, physically, and technically) from damage, alteration, or leakage.
*   **Scope:** Applies to information during its entire lifecycle: collection, processing, storage, and transmission.

**B. Need for Information Security**
*   **Privacy & Crime Prevention:** Increasing global demand to guarantee privacy and prevent cybercrimes.
*   **Protection of Assets:** Essential for protecting sensitive domestic technologies and information, especially with global internet connectivity.

### 3. Goals of Information Security (CIA Triad)

The three primary goals of information security are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These attributes must be ensured through administrative, physical, and technical measures.

*   **Confidentiality:**
    *   **Definition:** Ensuring that original information is not exposed to unauthorized users.
    *   **When:** Applies during storage and transmission.
    *   **Example:** Encrypting customer data to prevent unauthorized viewing.

*   **Integrity:**
    *   **Definition:** Maintaining the original information without unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   **When:** Applies during sending and receiving.
    *   **Example:** Using digital signatures to confirm data hasn't been tampered with in transit.

*   **Availability:**
    *   **Definition:** Ensuring that authorized users can access and use requested information and resources whenever needed.
    *   **When:** When users require access.
    *   **Example:** Maintaining server uptime and network access so applications run smoothly.

### 4. Basic Terms of Information Security

**A. Authentication**
*   **Definition:** A method to verify two things:
    1.  The legitimacy of the communicating parties (sender and receiver).
    2.  That the exchanged information has not been altered or deleted.
*   **Purpose:** Confirms identity and data validity.

**B. Non-repudiation**
*   **Definition:** Security technology that prevents an individual or entity from denying their actions (e.g., sending or receiving a message). It provides undeniable proof of an action.
*   **Categories:**
    *   **Non-repudiation of Origin (or Sending):** Prevents the sender from falsely denying that they sent a message. (e.g., proof that Bob sent a message).
    *   *(Note: The original text's definition for Non-repudiation of Origin was confusing and possibly incorrect. This definition reflects the standard understanding.)*

>>p Subject
Understanding  the concept  of information  security
>>> Recent  trends and major issues
IT-related  technologies,  such as the popularization  of the cloud, promotion  of big data, and the
artificial intelligence  industry,  are gradually  advancing,  as well as full-scale  development  of the loT
industry.  Various  convergence  technologies  and services  are also emerging.  However,  as information
security  technology  is not being applied to keep pace with this, various incidents  of security
infringement,  using new technology  and convergence  technology,  are expected  to increase.  As a
result, various security  technologies  and security  services  need to be urgently  developed  for the
information  security  of new technologies  and convergence  technologies.  Therefore,  we need to
understand  the concept  of information  security,  which becomes  the foundation.

+ Preview  for practical  business
Assistant  manager  Kim, working  for company  A has overseen  the development,  deployment,  and
maintenance  of Java source programs.  He used to check web pages and servers  on a regular  basis.
In this process, he should ensure the availability  of numerous  source codes that he is managing,  and
he should manage  the performance  and capacity  to ensure the availability  of the server, so that the
applications  can work properly.  He should also take technical  protection  measures,  like encryption,  to
maintain  the confidentiality  of customer  information  that is saved by the application.
He is trying to ensure confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of business  information.  Let’s take a
closer look at the concepts  and goals of information  security.
01 Overview  of information  security
A) Overview  of information  security
@® Concept  of information  security
Information  security  refers to protecting  information  administratively,  physically,  and technically  in order
to prevent  damage,  alteration,  and leakage  of information  while being collected,  processed,  stored, and
transmitted  information.
@ Need for information  security
The need to guarantee  privacy  and prevent  crimes on the Internet  is gradually  increasing.  Concerns  about the
leakage  of major domestic  technologies  and information are also increasing,  due to globalization,  as the entire
world is connected  through  the Internet.
