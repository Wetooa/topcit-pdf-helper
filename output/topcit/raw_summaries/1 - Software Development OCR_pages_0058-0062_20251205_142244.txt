## Software Development: Module Design Principles & Structural Methods

This guide covers essential concepts of software module design: **Cohesion**, **Coupling**, and **Structural Design Methods**.

---

### 1. Cohesion

**Definition:** Cohesion refers to how strongly related and focused the functional elements within a single module are. High cohesion is desirable.

**Types of Cohesion (from strongest/most desirable to weakest/least desirable):**

*   **Functional Cohesion:**
    *   All elements contribute to performing a **single, well-defined problem or function**.
    *   *Example:* A module solely responsible for calculating an employee's net pay.
*   **Sequential Cohesion:**
    *   Output data from one activity serves as input data for the next activity within the same module.
    *   *Example:* A module where 'read_data' outputs to 'process_data', which outputs to 'format_data'.
*   **Communicational Cohesion:**
    *   Components perform different functions but all operate on the **same input data and/or produce the same output data**.
    *   *Example:* A module that validates a user input and then formats it for display, both using the same user input.
*   **Procedural Cohesion:**
    *   A module has multiple related functions that are performed **sequentially** to achieve a larger task.
    *   *Example:* A module performing "read input, validate input, store input" in order.
*   **Temporal Cohesion:**
    *   Functions are grouped because they are processed at a **specific time** (e.g., initialization, shutdown).
    *   *Example:* A 'startup' module that initializes all system variables, opens logs, and loads configurations.
*   **Logical Cohesion:**
    *   Processing elements are grouped because they have **similar characteristics or classification**, but might not all be executed together.
    *   *Example:* A module containing all "report generation" functions, even if they produce different reports.
*   **Coincidental Cohesion:**
    *   Components within a module are **unrelated to each other**. This is the weakest and most undesirable form of cohesion.
    *   *Example:* A module containing 'print_document', 'calculate_average', and 'send_email'.

### 2. Coupling

**Definition:** Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence or complexity of correlations between different modules. Low coupling (weak coupling) is desirable.

**Why Weak Coupling is Important:**
*   **Module Independence:** Modules can function perfectly regardless of adjacent modules.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to change one module without significantly affecting others (reduces "ripple effect").
*   **Reduced Ripple Effect:** Prevents changes in one part of the system from causing widespread issues.

**How to Achieve Weak Coupling:**
*   Design interfaces carefully.
*   Use parameters for communication between modules.
*   **Avoid global variables** whenever possible.

**Types of Coupling (from weakest/most desirable to strongest/least desirable):**

*   **Data Coupling (Weakest, Most Desirable):**
    *   Modules communicate by passing **only data elements** as parameters/arguments.
    *   Called module returns processing result.
    *   Changes in one module do not affect another.
    *   *Example:* `calculate_sum(value1, value2)`
*   **Stamp Coupling:**
    *   Modules pass **data structures** (e.g., arrays, records) through interfaces.
    *   If the internal structure of the passed data structure changes, all modules using it are affected, even if they don't use the changed field.
    *   *Example:* `process_user_profile(UserObject)` where `UserObject` is a complex data structure.
*   **Control Coupling:**
    *   One module passes a **control element** (e.g., function code, switch, flag) to another module to dictate its logical flow.
    *   The calling (parent) module knows and controls the called (child) module's processing.
    *   *Example:* `process_order(order_data, process_type)` where `process_type` determines how `order_data` is handled.
*   **External Coupling:**
    *   Modules reference **externally declared data (variables)** from other modules.
    *   Limits the scope of referenced data.
    *   *Example:* Module A uses a variable `external_config` declared in Module B.
*   **Common Coupling:**
    *   Multiple modules **share a common global data area**.
    *   Any change to the common data affects all modules that use it, significantly weakening independence.
    *   *Example:* Multiple modules accessing a shared global `database_connection_pool`.
*   **Content Coupling (Strongest, Least Desirable, Avoid):**
    *   One module **directly refers to or modifies the internal function or data** of another module.
    *   Occurs when one module branches directly into the middle of another module.
    *   Extremely difficult to maintain; changes in one module directly break another.
    *   *Example:* Module A directly modifying a local variable inside Module B, or jumping to a specific line of code within Module B.

### 3. Structural Design Methods

**Goal:** Transform the logical design (structured analysis) into a detailed software structure (structured design). This process is often called **data flow-oriented design**.

**Key Notations:**
*   **Data Flow Diagram (DFD) / Bubble Chart:** Used in structured analysis to describe *logical* data flow and functions.
*   **Structure Chart:** Used in structured design to represent the *detailed structure* of software, showing data and control flow between modules, loops, and decisions.

**Information Flow Types:** Design conversion is guided by two main types of information flow within the system:
1.  **Transform Flow-Oriented Design**
2.  **Transaction Flow-Oriented Design**

---

### 4. Transform Flow-Oriented Design

**Purpose:** Designs systems that receive input, process it, and output results. It maps input-process-output systems to a hierarchical computer structure.

**Conceptual System Division:**
Systems can be divided into three logical parts based on information flow:
1.  **Incoming Flow (Input):**
    *   Receives raw input and refines it into data usable by the system.
    *   *Example:* Reading sensor data, validating format.
2.  **Transform Center (Processing):**
    *   Executes the main data processing functions (e.g., calculations, business logic).
    *   *Example:* Calculating averages, applying business rules.
3.  **Outgoing Flow (Output):**
    *   Receives processed information and converts/outputs it in the desired format.
    *   *Example:* Displaying results on a screen, writing to a file.

**Program Structure (High-Level):**
Based on identifying the incoming flow, transform center, and outgoing flow in the DFD, the program structure typically includes three main control modules:
*   **Input Control Module:** Manages input data, refines it, and passes it up the hierarchy.
*   **Transform Control Module:** Contains the core logic for processing data.
*   **Output Control Module:** Manages output data, refines it, and sends it down to lower-level modules for presentation/storage.

---

### 5. Transaction Flow-Oriented Design

**Definition of a Transaction:** An event (data, control signal) that triggers a specific action.

**When to Use:**
*   When the received input (transaction) can be split into **multiple, mutually exclusive output flows (actions)**.
*   The system evaluates the input and routes it down one of several possible paths.

**Transaction Center:**
*   The central point in the information flow where the input transaction is evaluated and routed.
*   **Characteristics:** One input path, multiple output (action) paths.
*   Each action path can itself contain transform flows or further transaction flows.

**Program Structure Components:**
A program structure based on transactions typically consists of:
*   **Overall Controller (Input Receiver):** A module that receives the initial input (transaction).
*   **Transaction Controller (Transaction Center):** A module that evaluates the input and dispatches it to the appropriate action path.
*   **Multiple Action Path Controllers:** One or more modules corresponding to each unique operation path that can be triggered by a transaction.

B) Coupling
Modules  have an associative  relationship  with other modules.  “Coupling”  refers to the complexity  of correlations
between  modules.  Coupling  between  the modules  increases  when modules  interact  more and depend  on each
other more. In particular,  when the interface  is not set correctly  or the functions  are not correctly  divided,  an
unnecessary  interface  appears  and increases  the degree of dependence  between  modules  and coupling.
Coupling  is a method of indicating  a correlation  between  program  elements  and is closely related to module
independence  and cohesion.  If two modules  function  perfectly,  whether  they are adjacent  to each other or
not, they are completely  independent  of each other and do not interact  at all. Data coupling  in which modules
communicate  with parameters  is the most ideal - and weakest  - coupling.  Content  coupling  in which a module
directly refers to or modifies  another  module’s  internal function  or data is the strongest  coupling,  and should
be avoided.
If coupling  is strong, it is difficult to change a module independently,  and changes  in one module affect other
modules  significantly,  causing  a ripple effect. The greater  the ripple effect, the more difficult it is to maintain
the system.  The ripple effect is a phenomenon  in which, when one thing is affected,  it goes on to affect many
other things. If this effect occurs in system  development,  it lands many people in trouble.
Therefore,  coupling  needs to be reduced  as much as possible  when designing  software. When modules  share
variables  or exchange  control information,  coupling  between  modules  increases.  Because  of this (to weaken
coupling),  we are instructed  not to use global variables,  if possible,  and to use parameters  when learning

programming.  Types of coupling  include data coupling,  stamp coupling,  control coupling,  external coupling,
common  coupling,  and content  coupling.

Weak coupling  «---------------------------------------  > Strong  coupling
[Figure  12] Type and degree  of coupling
@ Data coupling
+ Data coupling  refers to coupling  when the interface  between  modules  is composed  of data elements  only.
+A module passes data as a parameter  or argument  while calling another  module, whereupon  the called
module  returns  the processing  result of the received  data.
+ Data coupling  does not have to know the contents  between  modules  at all. It is the most desirable  coupling,
as changes  in one module do not affect another  module  at all.
@ Stamp coupling
+ Stamp coupling  refers to coupling  in which a data structure  such as an array or record is passed over to the
interface  between  modules.
+ In stamp coupling,  two modules  retrieve  the same data structure.  If the data structure  is changed, that is,
if the format or structure  is changed,  all modules  that do retrieve it, along with the module that does not
actually  retrieve  the changing  field, are affected.
© Control  Coupling
+ Control  coupling  refers to coupling  in which a control element  (function  code, switch, tag, flag) used to control
a logical flow is transferred  from one module  to another.
+ It occurs when the parent module knows and controls  the detailed  processing  procedure  of the child module
or when the processing  functions  are split into two modules  in the design.
@ External  coupling
+ External  coupling  refers to coupling  in which data (variables)  declared  externally  by one module  are referenced
by another  module.
* Each module  can limit the scope of referenced  data.
@® Common  coupling
+ Common  coupling  refers to coupling  in which several modules  share a common  data area.
* Common  coupling  weakens  modules’  independence  because  any changes  to the common  data area affect all
of the modules  that use the common  data.
