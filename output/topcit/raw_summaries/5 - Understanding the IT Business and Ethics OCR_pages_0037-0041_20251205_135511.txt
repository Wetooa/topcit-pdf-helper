## 1. External Environment Analysis

### A. Porter's Five Forces Framework

**Purpose:** An industry structure analysis model to understand the forces shaping an industry and how companies can respond to threats.

**The Five Forces (and their key factors):**

1.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:**
    *   **Factors:** Supplier's market share, volume supplied, technological superiority, importance of supplied product.
2.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers:**
    *   **Factors:** Purchaser's price sensitivity, amount purchased, importance of a purchaser.
3.  **Threat of New Entrants:**
    *   **Factors:** Entry barriers, product differentiation, financial resources of new entrants, market penetration level, brand recognition.
4.  **Threat of Substitutes:**
    *   **Factors:** Changes in consumer needs, price competitiveness of substitutes, impact of replacement.
    *(Note: The fifth force, "Rivalry among existing competitors," is usually included in Porter's model but not detailed in the provided text.)*

### B. 3C and 4P Analysis Method

**Purpose:** A micro-external environmental analysis method used to analyze an industry's market, crucial for marketing products/services and understanding the competitive environment.

**1. The 3C's:**

*   **Customer Analysis:**
    *   Identify target customers, product positioning, and customer demand.
    *   Estimate market size and market growth rate.

    *   Used for setting company goals and developing strategies.
*   **Competitor Analysis:**
    *   Identify current and potential competitors.
    *   Use market analysis, financial data, and business portfolios.

## 2. Internal Environment Analysis

### A. McKinsey 7S Analysis Method

**Purpose:** An internal environmental analysis technique to diagnose a company by identifying its core competency components. It defines these components using 7 items starting with 'S'.

**The 7 S's:**

1.  **Shared Values:** Ideals and mission shared by organizational members; values emphasized and universally shared.
2.  **Strategy:** Company's goals and vision; assessment of budget, organization, and human resources needed to achieve the strategy.
3.  **System:** Processes and techniques for managing people and making decisions; includes regulations and policies.
4.  **Structure:** Organizational form, workforce structure, division of responsibilities between departments, and coordination systems.
5.  **Staff:** Capabilities, qualities, and expertise levels of staff; including strengths/weaknesses and environment for demonstrating capabilities.
6.  **Style:** Management and operational style of the company; leadership exhibited and organizational culture.
7.  **Skills:** Organizational operations and management skills; employee skills needed to run the company and core competencies.

**Key takeaway:** The 7S elements are dynamic and interconnected. Weakness in one area can impact others. A company must manage its 7S comprehensively to achieve business goals.

## 3. Consolidated Internal & External Environment Analysis

### A. SWOT Analysis

**Purpose:** A framework for analyzing a company's **internal strengths (S)** and **weaknesses (W)** alongside **external opportunities (O)** and **threats (T)**. Used primarily for establishing strategies, especially overall company strategy and marketing activities.

**Framework:**
The analysis results are often mapped into a matrix:

| Strategic Direction | Opportunities (O) | Threats (T) |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------- |
| **Strengths (S)**   | SO Strategy       | ST Strategy |
| **Weaknesses (W)**  | WO Strategy       | WT Strategy |

**Evolution & Value:**

*   **Historically:** Often based on abstract insights and theoretical arguments, leading to limited practical implications.
*   **Today (Renewed Attention):** With the integration of IT and Business Intelligence (BI), SWOT analysis is enhanced by high-quality, data-backed information.
    *   This provides objective and predictive results.
    *   Improved data quality leads to better company strategies, especially when quantified numerical data is analyzed from multiple angles.

### B. BCG Matrix (Boston Consulting Group Matrix)

**Purpose:** A market analysis technique used to evaluate a company's portfolio of products and business services, or even a single company/department. It helps in marketing and sales planning.

**Structure:** A two-dimensional matrix evaluating products/services based on:

*   **Vertical Index:** Market Growth (external environment)
*   **Horizontal Index:** Market Share (internal environment)

**The Four Quadrants:**

1.  **Dog:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Low market share, low growth potential.
    *   **Strategy:** Consider exiting the business.
2.  **Question Mark (?):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Low market share, high growth potential.
    *   **Strategy:** Requires investment to increase market share, with uncertain future.
3.  **Star (*):**
    *   **Characteristics:** High market share, high growth potential.
    *   **Strategy:** Requires continuous investment to maintain growth and position.
4.  **Cash Cow:**
    *   **Characteristics:** High market share, low growth potential.
    *   **Strategy:** Generates high cash flows with low investment; profits can fund other areas.

The Five Forces Framework  proposed  by Michael Porter is a type of industry  structure  analysis  model. In a 1979 HBR
paper, he asserted  that the five factors shape the structure  of an industry,  and that companies  can actively  respond
to threats  by closely  studying  the five factors.
@ 3C and 4P Analysis  Method
The 3C/4P framework,  a micro-external environmental  method  of analysis, issued to analyze  the market of the
industry  to which a company  belongs.  It is widely used for marketing  products  and business  services  and for analyzing
the competitive  market  environment.
+ 3C -Customer,  Company,  Competition
+ 4P -Product,  Price, Place, Promotion
The 3C’s consist  of three pillars: customer  analysis,  company  analysis,  and competitor  analysis.  In customer  analysis,
the market  size and market  growth rate are estimated  by identifying  the customer  target, product  positioning,  and
customer  demand  hierarchy.
In company  analysis,  the internal/external  environment  surrounding  the company,  as well as its strengths  and
weaknesses, are examined  (in conjunction  with the SWOT analysis  technique) and used  in setting the company’s
goals and developing  its strategies.
In competitor  analysis,  current  competitors  and potential  competitors  are identified  by using market  analysis  and the
competitors’  financial  data and business  portfolios.
The 4P’s consist  of product,  price, place (place of sale), and promotion.
In product  analysis,  the design, brand, characteristics,  brand power, performance,  and quality  of the product  concerned
are analyzed.
In price analysis,  the product  price, discount  condition,  and demand  as a function  of price levels are analyzed,  and the
price is compared  to the prices of the competitors,  and the price flexibility  is examined.
In place analysis,  the region of product  sales, distribution,  logistics,  and inventory  levels are analyzed.
In promotion  analysis,the  advertising,  promotion,  marketing,  and customer  communication  strategies  are analyzed.
