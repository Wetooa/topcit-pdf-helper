## Learning Guide: IT Business & Ethics

This guide covers essential concepts related to computer program works, copyright, open source software, and industrial property rights.

---

### 1. Computer Program Works & Copyright

#### 1.1 What is Software?
*   **Software** refers to collections of instructions and commands (including audio/visual info) that allow equipment (computers, communications apparatus, automation equipment) to perform tasks like command, control, input, process, save, output, and interact. It also includes descriptions used to prepare them and related data.

#### 1.2 What is a Computer Program Work?
*   A **computer program work** is a general term for a computer program and its descriptive language.
*   **Includes:** Programming languages (C, Java), protocols, algorithms, source code, object code, and program structure/arrangement.
*   **Copyright Protection:**
    *   **Protected:** Source code, object code, program structure, and arrangement.
    *   **NOT Protected:** Programming languages, protocols, and algorithms used for programming.
    *   **In essence:** The *product* of writing software is copyrighted, but the *tools and methods* for writing it are not.

#### 1.3 Software Licenses
*   **Copyright** grants the software author exclusive rights to use, copy, distribute, and modify their software.
*   A **license** is when the software author gives specific rights to others to perform certain actions with the software.
*   **License Agreements** detail contract purpose, definitions, license terms, duration, record keeping, and royalties to prevent disputes.

---

### 2. Open Source Software (OSS)

#### 2.1 What is Open Source Software?
*   **Open Source Software (OSS)** allows anyone to freely use, copy, distribute, and modify its source code.
*   **Examples:** Apache web server, Firefox Web Browser, Linux Kernel.

#### 2.2 Basic Requirements for Most OSS Licenses
*   Acknowledge the developer/contributor and copyright information on the product.
*   If source code is modified, include modification details (who, when).
*   When distributing software, attach a copy of the license.
*   **Copyleft:** Some licenses require redistribution under the *same* license, meaning the source code must also be distributed.

#### 2.3 Key Open Source Software Licenses

| License Type                  | Key Characteristics & Obligations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BSD License**               | *   Very permissive. <br> *   No obligation to disclose source code. <br> *   No copyright notice or warranty liability required when distributing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Apache License 2.0**        | *   Self-produced by Apache Software Foundation. <br> *   No obligation to disclose source code. <br> *   If modifying/distributing, must include Apache License 2.0 and state it's Apache Foundation software.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **GPL (GNU General Public License) 2.0/3.0** | *   Created by Free Software Foundation (FSF). <br> *   Most widely adopted open source license. <br> *   **Stricter obligations (strong copyleft):** Requires derivative works (works based on GPL code) to also be distributed under GPL, meaning their source code must be made available.                                                                                   |
| **GNU LGPL (Lesser GPL) 2.1** | *   Separate from GPL, for libraries. <br> *   Does **not** apply GPL's strict copyleft provisions (no obligation to provide source code for the entire linked application). <br> *   Allows linking to simple libraries and modules.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **MPL (Mozilla Public License)** | *   Developed for Netscape Browser. <br> *   Separates copyright for source code and executable files. <br> *   Allows distributing the executable file under an exclusive license, while source modifications may still need to be disclosed. (File unit copyleft – only modifications to MPL-licensed files need to be open source, not the entire linked project). |

### 3. Works Not Protected by Copyright Law

The following works are NOT protected by copyright:
*   Constitutions, Acts, treaties, decrees, municipal ordinances, and rules.
*   Bulletins, public notifications, directives, and similar documents issued by central or local governments.
*   Compilations or translations of works produced by central or local governments.
*   Judgments, decisions, orders, adjudications of courts, rulings, and decisions from administrative appeals.
*   Current news reporting that delivers simple facts.

---

### 4. Duration of Copyright Protection (Economic Rights)

Once the protection period expires, works can be used freely without author permission.
*   **Independent Works:** 70 years after the author's death.
*   **Joint Works:** 70 years after the death of the *last surviving* co-author.
*   **Anonymous/Pseudonymous Works:** 70 years after publication.
*   **Works Made for Hire:** 70 years after publication. If not published within 50 years of creation, then 70 years after creation.

**Note:** The duration starts from the *next year* following the event (death, publication, creation).

---

### 5. Copyright Registration

#### 5.1 What is Copyright Registration?
*   A process of officially recording facts and legal relations about a work (e.g., author's name) in a public ledger (Copyright Register) and disclosing them.

#### 5.2 What Can Be Registered?
*   Author's real name, pseudonym, nationality, domicile/residence.
*   Title, type, creation date of the work.
*   Publication status, country, and first publication date.
*   Title and author of the original work (for derivative works).
*   Information on publication medium.
*   Shares of registered rights holders (if multiple).

#### 5.3 How to Register (Documents Required)
Submit the following to the Korea Copyright Commission:
*   Copyright/Program registration application form.
*   Copyright/Program registration application statement.
*   Copies of the work (drawings, photos, electronic media). For programs, an electronic medium with a copy of the program (partial excerpt allowed if sufficient proof of creation).
*   Documents proving the reason for registration (if required).
*   List of authors/rights holders (if multiple).
*   List of works (if registering many).

*The Korea Copyright Commission issues a copyright registration certificate.*

#### 6.3 Acquisition of Industrial Property Rights
*   **Acquisition:** By registering with the Korean Intellectual Property Office.
*   **First-to-File Rule:** The first to file an application receives the right.
*   **Territorial Protection:** Rights are recognized only in the country where registered; separate applications needed for each country.

#### 6.4 Violation of Industrial Property Rights

*   **Cases of Violation (Examples of False Display):**
    *   Displaying a non-existent, non-applied, or inappropriate patent/registration number (e.g., marking a utility model as a patent).
    *   Marking a product as "patent pending" or "registered trademark" when it's not.
    *   Using false trademarks in advertisements or packaging.
    *   Theft of renowned domestic or foreign trademarks.
*   **Punishment:**
    *   Imprisonment for up to 3 years or a fine of up to 20 million won for falsely displaying intellectual property rights.
    *   This is an **offense not subject to complaint**, meaning anyone (even a third party not directly harmed) can file criminal charges with the prosecution or police.

@® Computer  Program  Works
According  to Article 2 of the Software  Industry  Promotion  Act, the term “software”  means a collection  of
instructions  and commands  (including  audio or visual information,  etc.) that enables  equipment,  such as computers,
communications  apparatuses  and automation  equipment  and peripheral  equipment  to command,  control, input,
process,  save, output and interact,  and descriptions  used to prepare  them and other related data.
A computer  program  work is a generic  term for a computer  program  and a work of descriptive  language  of a program.
A computer  program  work includes  programming  language  (C, Java, etc.), protocol,  algorithm,  source code and object
code (compiled  source code), and © structure  and arrangement  method of the program.  Here, the source code,
object  code, program  structure  and arrangement  are protected by copyright,  but programming  languages,  protocols,
algorithms,  etc. for programming  are excluded  from the protection.  In other words, the product  of writing software  is
protected  by copyright,  but programming  languages,  protocols,  and algorithms  for writing  programs  are excluded  from
copyright  protection.
Software  is copyrighted  so that only the software  author has the right to use, copy, distribute,  and modify  the
software.  If the software  author gives someone  the right to perform certain actions, this is called a “license.”  The
software  license agreement  contains  detailed  regulations  based on the basic contents  of the purpose  of the contract,
the definition  clause, the establishment  of the license,  the term of the contract,  the storage  of records,  and royalties,
in order to clearly  set forth the criteria for settlement  in case of dispute.
© Open Source  Software  Copyright
Open source software  (OSS, Open Source  Software)  refers to software  in which anyone  can freely use/copy/distribute/
modify  its source code. Representative  examples  include  Apache  web server, FireFox  Web Browser,  and Linux Kernel.
<Table 107> Open Source  Software  License

ESSENCE
+ If the source code is modified,  information  on the modification,  such as who modified  the code and when, should be
included.
+ When distributing  software,  attach a copy of the license  to provide license information  on open source.
Depending  on the type of open source license, some licenses  require a copyleft  to redistribute  under the same
license. If the copyleft  clause is included,  the source code is also distributed  when the software  is distributed.
The characteristics  of each open source license are as follows.
