## Learning Guide: Information and System Security

This guide covers essential principles of **encryption key management** and fundamental practices for **Windows system security**.

---

### Part 1: Encryption Key Management

Effective management of encryption keys is crucial for data security. It involves distinct stages:

1.  **Key Storage Stage:**
    *   **Method:** Store encryption keys using **hardware storage** methods.
    *   **Examples:** A separate **Key Management Server (KMS)** or a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**.
    *   **Avoid:** Hardcoding keys in applications, saving them as files, or storing them directly in a Database Management System (DBMS).

2.  **Key Use Stage:**
    *   **Principles:** Apply **"least privilege"** (users only get access needed for their job) and **"separation of duty"** (no single person has complete control).
    *   **Access:** Only authorized personnel (e.g., database administrators, security managers) should access or modify master keys.

3.  **Key Backup and Recovery Stage:**
    *   **Procedure:** Establish clear backup and recovery procedures for encryption keys.
    *   **Frequency:** Back up keys periodically, following your organization's key backup policy.
    *   **Purpose:** To recover keys if lost or damaged.

4.  **Key Replacement Stage:**
    *   **Frequency:** Replace encryption keys periodically as per organizational policy to maintain security.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Decrypt existing data with the current key.
        2.  Create a new encryption key.
        3.  Encrypt the data again using the new key.

5.  **Key Destruction Stage:**
    *   **Scenario:** When an encryption key is lost, damaged, or no longer needed.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  If lost/damaged, decrypt data using a backed-up key (if available).
        2.  Generate a new encryption key.
        3.  Encrypt the data again with the new key.
        4.  Destroy the old, lost, or damaged encryption key.

### Part 2: Understanding System Security

**Objective:** Learn to apply security settings to Windows, UNIX, and Linux systems.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **APT Attacks (Advanced Persistent Threats):** Sophisticated, long-term attacks designed to gain access to a network and remain undetected.
*   **Password Crack / Brute Force Attack:** Attempts to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination.
*   **UMASK:** (UNIX/Linux) Controls the default file permission mask for newly created files and directories.
*   **Daemon:** (UNIX/Linux) A background process that runs without user interaction, often performing system tasks.
*   **Anonymous FTP:** Allows users to access files on an FTP server without a specific username or password.
*   **Secure FTP (SFTP/FTPS):** Encrypted versions of FTP for secure file transfer.

### Part 3: Real-World Impact - Lessons from Cyber Attacks

**Case Study: March 20, 2013 Cyber Terror**

*   **Incident:** Major domestic broadcasting and financial companies experienced system paralysis due to a cyber-attack. Malware was distributed via an update management server (PMS).
*   **Identified Causes of Hacking Damage:**
    1.  **Insecure Administrator PCs:** Servers were accessible from non-administrator IP addresses.
    2.  **Weak Patch Management:** Security patches were not applied properly, and authentication for the update server was weak.
    3.  **Poor Configuration:** Default passwords were used, and unnecessary commands were not restricted.

**Learning Point:** These incidents highlight the need for robust system security practices to prevent similar attacks.

### Part 4: Windows System Security Best Practices

Windows systems require comprehensive security management across various areas.

#### A) Overview of Windows System Security Areas

| Item                    | Detailed Security Checks                                                                                                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Account & Password**  | Unnecessary accounts, administrator privileges, vulnerable passwords, encryption, automatic account locks, password expiration.     |
| **Access Control**      | Shared folders, remote registry access, automatic screen locks.                                                                 |
| **System Security**     | Privilege settings (system directory, Windows account), system utilization rates.                                                 |
| **Service Security**    | Unnecessary service shutdown (terminal, anonymous FTP, SNMP settings).                                                          |
| **Monitoring**          | System audit policies, log record settings.                                                                                     |
| **Other Security**      | Security settings, task scheduling details, anti-virus status, latest patch checks.                                             |

#### B) Account and Password Management

1.  **Delete Guest and Unnecessary Accounts:**
    *   **Rationale:** Guest accounts can be a security risk. If access for unspecified individuals is needed, create standard user accounts.
    *   **How-to:**
        *   Open "Local Users and Groups" by typing `lusrmgr.msc` in the Start menu search box.
        *   Delete guest accounts and any other unnecessary accounts.

2.  **Set Account Lockout Policy:**
    *   **Rationale:** Protect against **brute force attacks** and **password cracking** by locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   **Recommended Settings:**
        *   **Account lockout duration:** 60 minutes
        *   **Account lockout threshold:** 5 invalid logon attempts
        *   **Reset account lockout counter after:** 60 minutes
    *   **How-to:**
        *   Open "Local Security Policy" by typing `secpol.msc` in the Start menu search box.
        *   Navigate to `Account Policies` > `Account Lockout Policy`.
        *   Configure the three settings listed above.

#### C) Access Control

1.  **Check and Stop Unnecessary Shared Folders:**
    *   **Rationale:** Unnecessary shared folders can be a vector for malware and virus spread. Only allow authorized users to access necessary shared folders.
    *   **How-to:**
        *   Open "Shared Folders" management by typing `fsmgmt.msc` in the Start menu search box.
        *   Review shared folders and stop sharing any that are not necessary.

Information  security )
@ Key storage  stage
Encryption  keys should be stored using the hardware  storage method,  such as a separate  key management
server or an HSM (Hard Security  Module), instead of hardcoding  the encryption  key into the application
program,  saving as a file in the file system,  or storing  the encryption  key inside the DBMS.
@ Key use stage
The database  administrator  and security  manager  should apply the principles  of “granting least privilege  and
separation  of duty”, and they should only allow authorized  persons  to access or modify  the master  key.
@® Key backup  and recovery  stage
Backup  and recovery  procedures  for the encryption  key should be prepared  to recover  it when lost or damaged,
and the encryption  key should be backed up periodically,  according  to the key backup policy.
© Key replacement  stage
The security  of the encryption  key should be maintained by  replacing  it periodically,  according  to the internal
policy of the organization.  Before replacing  the encryption  key, data should be decrypted  with the existing
encryption  key, and a new encryption  key should be created.  Then, the data should be encrypted  again.
@ Key destruction  stage
When the encryption  key is lost or damaged,  the data should be decrypted  using the encryption  key that has
been backed up by the administrator,  according  to the procedure  stipulated  by the organization  policy. A new
encryption  key should be generated,  and the data should be encrypted  with the generated  key again. Then,
the lost or damaged  encryption  key should be destroyed.

+ Preview  for practical  business
All systems  of major domestic  broadcasting  companies  and financial  companies  were paralyzed,  due
to exposure  to cyber terror, on March 20, 2013. The internal computer  networks  of 3 broadcasting
companies  and 4 financial  companies  were down all at once, around 2 pm on this day, and serious
confusion  occurred.  As computer  networks  at similar institutions  were down at the same time,
the police suspected  a high possibility  of cyber terror and began an investigation.  The Korea
Communications  Commission  announced  that the incident  was caused by malware,  distributed  by
the update management  server (PMS), and the extent of the damage  was so enormous  that it was
difficult  to estimate.
Financial  company  A, a hacking  victim, analyzed  three major causes  of hacking  damage:
1) The administrator  PC was not secure enough and servers  could be accessed  from the IP address,
other than that of the administrator.
2) Security  patches  were not applied properly,  and authentication  of the updated  server  was weak.
3) Default passwords  were used, and the use of unnecessary  commands  were not restricted.
Let’s learn how to set security,  according  to the system characteristics,  to effectively  respond  to
cyber-attack  damage,  such as in the case of company  A, and how to manage systems  safely, based
on such understanding.
