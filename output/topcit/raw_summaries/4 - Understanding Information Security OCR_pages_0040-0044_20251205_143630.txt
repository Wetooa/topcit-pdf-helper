# Digital Signatures, PKI, and Access Control: Learning Guide

## 1. Digital Signatures

### 1.1 Requirements for a Secure Digital Signature
A robust digital signature algorithm must meet the following criteria:
*   **Forgery Prevention:** Only the legitimate signer can create a valid signature.
*   **User Authentication:** The signer's identity can be verified from the signature.
*   **Non-Repudiation:** The signer cannot credibly deny having signed the document.
*   **Alteration Prevention:** Any change to a signed document invalidates its signature.
*   **Reuse Prevention:** A signature for one document cannot be validly applied to another.

### 1.2 Operation of an Electronic (Digital) Signature
The process of creating and verifying a digital signature involves six phases:

**Sender's Actions:**
1.  **Generate Message Digest:** The sender applies a **hash algorithm** (a mathematical function that converts input data into a fixed-size string) to the original message. This produces a unique, fixed-length string called a **message digest**.
2.  **Create Digital Signature:** The sender **encrypts** the generated message digest using their **private key** (a secret key known only to the sender). The result is the digital signature.
3.  **Send:** The sender transmits both the original message and the digital signature to the receiver.

**Receiver's Actions:**
4.  **Extract Sender's Message Digest:** The receiver **decrypts** the received digital signature using the sender's **public key** (a publicly available key mathematically linked to the sender's private key). This reveals the sender's original message digest.
5.  **Generate Receiver's Message Digest:** The receiver applies the **same hash algorithm** to the received message to produce a new message digest from their end.
6.  **Compare Digests:** The receiver compares the message digest obtained from the sender's signature (in step 4) with the message digest they just generated (in step 5).
    *   **If they match:** The signature is legitimate, confirming the message's authenticity and integrity (it hasn't been altered, and it came from the expected sender).

## 2. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

### 2.1 Definition of PKI
PKI is a comprehensive system designed to manage public keys and digital certificates. Its purpose is to enable secure digital transactions and communications by providing essential services like encryption, authentication, and non-repudiation.

### 2.2 PKI Components
A PKI ecosystem consists of several interacting entities and elements:
*   **Policy Approval Authority (PAA):** Establishes the overarching policies and procedures for the entire PKI.
*   **Policy Certification Authority (PCA):** Defines detailed policies that conform to the PAA's high-level policies.
*   **Certification Authority (CA):** A trusted third party responsible for:
    *   Issuing digital certificates that bind public keys to specific entities.
    *   Managing and publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
*   **Registration Authority (RA):** Acts as an intermediary, verifying the identity of certificate applicants before forwarding their requests to the CA.
*   **Certificate Holder:** The individual or entity who owns a public key certificate and uses it for digital signing and encryption.
*   **User:** An individual who uses and verifies certificates, typically relying on the CA's public key to confirm the authenticity of other certificates.
*   **Public Key Certificate:** An electronic document (conforming to the X.509 standard) that cryptographically links a public key to an owner, verifying their identity.
*   **CRL Repository:** A database that stores and provides access to the Certificate Revocation List.

### 2.3 PKI Operation Workflow
1.  **Application:** A user applies for a digital certificate at an RA branch and undergoes identity verification.
2.  **Request:** The RA sends the verified certificate issuance request to the CA.
3.  **Issuance:** The CA issues the certificate (containing the user's public key, digitally signed by the CA's private key).
4.  **Distribution:** The CA publishes the certificate to a directory server and typically sends it to the user (often via the RA).
5.  **Usage:** The user stores and uses the certificate for secure activities like financial transactions.
6.  **Verification:** Other parties (e.g., financial institutions) verify the certificate's validity by contacting the public CA.

### 2.4 Electronic Signature and Encryption in PKI (Combined Process for Confidentiality & Authenticity)
This process ensures both confidentiality (message secrecy) and authenticity/integrity (message source and unalteration).

*   **Session Key:** A temporary, symmetric secret key used by the sender to encrypt the actual message. Symmetric keys are faster for encrypting large amounts of data.
*   **Electronic Envelope:** The session key itself, encrypted using the receiver's public key, ensuring only the intended receiver can decrypt it.

**Sender's Steps:**
1.  **Message Digest:** Generate a message digest from the original message (for authenticity).
2.  **Digital Signature:** Encrypt the message digest with the **sender's private key** (this is the digital signature).
3.  **Message Encryption:** Encrypt the original message using a randomly generated **session key** (for confidentiality).
4.  **Electronic Envelope:** Encrypt the **session key** using the **receiver's public key** (to securely transmit the session key).
5.  **Send:** Transmit the symmetrically encrypted message, the digital signature, and the electronic envelope.

**Receiver's Steps:**
1.  **Extract Session Key:** Decrypt the **electronic envelope** using the **receiver's private key** to retrieve the session key.
2.  **Decrypt Message:** Decrypt the encrypted message using the extracted **session key**.
3.  **Receiver's Digest:** Generate a new message digest from the newly decrypted message.
4.  **Sender's Digest:** Decrypt the **digital signature** using the **sender's public key** to get the sender's original message digest.
5.  **Compare Digests:** Compare the two message digests. If they match, the message is verified as authentic and unaltered.

### 2.5 Public Key Certificate Details

*   **Standard:** Public key certificates are issued by CAs and conform to the **X.509 standard**.
*   **Types:**
    *   **NPKI Certificates:** Used by the general public for financial and e-commerce transactions.
    *   **GPKI Certificates:** Used by government administrative agencies for official work.
*   **Evolution (Since 2011):**
    *   **RSA Key Length:** Increased from 1,024 bits to **2,048 bits** for stronger encryption.
    *   **Hash Function:** Upgraded from SHA-1 (producing a 160-bit value) to **SHA-256** (producing a 256-bit value) for enhanced security against collisions.

*   **Main Contents of a Public Key Certificate:**
    *   **Version:** Specifies the certificate format version.
    *   **Serial Number:** A unique identifier assigned by the issuing CA.
    *   **Algorithm Identifier:** Identifies the signature algorithm used to create the certificate.
    *   **Issuer:** The Distinguished Name (DN) of the CA that issued the certificate.
    *   **Period of Validity:** The start and expiration dates/times of the certificate's validity.
    *   **Subject:** The Distinguished Name (DN) of the certificate owner.
    *   **Public-key Information:** Contains the certificate owner's public key and the algorithm it uses.
    *   **Signature:** The CA's digital signature, created using its private key, which validates the certificate itself.

### 2.6 Verifying Certificate Validity
Methods used to check if a certificate is still trustworthy:

*   **CRL (Certificate Revocation List):**
    *   **Concept:** A list, published by a CA, containing the serial numbers of certificates that have been revoked before their scheduled expiration.
    *   **Operation:** Users periodically download this list and check if a certificate in question appears on it.
    *   **Limitations:** Can be outdated if download cycles are too long, or create high overhead if cycles are too short.

*   **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):**
    *   **Concept:** A real-time protocol that addresses CRL's latency issues by allowing immediate status checks.
    *   **Operation:** When a user needs to verify a certificate, an OCSP request is sent to an OCSP server (typically HTTP-based), which immediately responds with the certificate's current status (valid, revoked, unknown).

## 3. Access Control Technology

### 3.1 Overview of Access Control

*   **Concept:** Access control is the process of regulating who (subjects) can interact with a system and what specific actions (tasks) they are permitted to perform on which resources (objects).
*   **Three Core Parts:**
    1.  **Identification:**
        *   **Definition:** The system's process of recognizing a subject by a unique characteristic or token.
        *   **Examples:** User ID, employee card, biometric scans.
    2.  **Authentication:**
        *   **Definition:** The subject's process of proving their claimed identity to the system.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   **Something you know:** Passwords, PINs.
            *   **Something you have:** Certificates, One-Time Passwords (OTP) tokens.
            *   **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans).
    3.  **Authorization:**
        *   **Definition:** After successful authentication, the system determines and enforces the specific permissions (what tasks/objects) the authenticated user is allowed to access or perform.
        *   **Examples:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### 3.2 Access Control Procedure
Access to a system or resource follows a sequential process:
1.  **Identification:** The user presents their identity.
2.  **Authentication:** The user proves their identity.
3.  **Authorization:** The system checks the authenticated user's permissions.
4.  **Access:** If authorized, the user is granted access to the requested resources or functions.

ESSENCE
@ Requirements  for a secure digital signature  algorithm
+ Forgery  prevention:  Anyone  other than a legitimate  signer shouldn't  be able to forge the signature.
+ User authentication:  The signer should be identifiable  from the electronic  signature.
+ Non-repudiation:  The signer should not be able to deny that the signer has signed the document.

© Operation  of the electronic  signature
The operation  of the digital signature  consists  of six phases  as shown in <Table 9>.
<Table  9> Operation  procedure  of the electronic  signature
Order Description
Phase 1 The sender  generates  a message  digest, a fixed-length  string, by applying  a hash algorithm  to the message
to be sent.
Phase 2 The sender  creates  an electronic  signature  by encrypting  the created message  digest using the sender's
private key.
Phase  3 The sender  sends a message  and digital signature  to the receiver.
The receiver  extracts  the message  digest  generated  by the sender, by decrypting  the received  digitalPhase 4 : . : -
signature  using the sender's  public key.
Phase 5 The receiver  generates  a new message  digest by applying  the same hash algorithm  as the sender  to the
received  message.
Phase 6 The receiver  compares  the message  digest received  from the sender,  with the receiver's  message  digest. If
they are the same, it is regarded  as the electronic  signature  of the legitimate  sender.
E) PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
© Definition  of PKI
PKI is an infrastructure  for managing  the public key, which is an essential  element  for encryption  and
authentication  required  for secure transactions.  This infrastructure  safely distributes  encryption  and decryption
keys, as well as certificates  that provide information  security  services.  PKI is a network  structure  of objects
that sets up and provides  policies, means, and tools, which makes the use of certificates  and encrypted
communication  easy in various application  fields that require secure communication,  such as information
system  security  and electronic  commerce.
@ PKI components
As shown in <Table 10>, the PKI is composed  of the policy approval  authority  (PAA), policy certification
authority  (PCA), certification authority  (CA), registration  authority  (RA), and public certificate.

When the user requests  certificate  issuance  to the RA after applying  for subscription  and checking identity
at the RA branch, the RA sends the issuance  and registration  request  information  to the CA. The CA issues a
private key signed with the CA's private key, and posts it to the directory  serverthen  sends it to the user, via
the RA. The user stores the issued certificate  in a hard disk or a removable  disk of a PC and uses it in financial
transactions  and electronic  commerce.  At this point, financial  institutions  verify the certificate  by contacting
the public CA. [Figure 20] shows the participants  of the PKI and the workflow  between  them.
