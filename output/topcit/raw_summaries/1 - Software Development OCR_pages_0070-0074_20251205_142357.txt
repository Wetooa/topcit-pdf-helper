# Software Development: Object-Oriented Analysis & Design

## 1. Object-Oriented Analysis and Modeling

### 1.1 Object Orientation (OO)
*   **Concept:** Views a problem as a collection of real-world objects interacting with each other. It virtualizes real-world problems for computers.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Increases object reusability.
    *   Deepens understanding of system participants.
    *   Applies a consistent methodology (analysis, design, programming) throughout development.
*   **Analysis Technique:** Identifies software objects by examining them from three viewpoints (information, dynamic, functional) to discover their properties and behaviors.

### 1.2 What is Modeling?
*   **Definition:** The process of simplifying a system's performance/operation (often diagrammatically) or expressing its characteristics mathematically for analysis. It helps express and understand the real world in software development.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Forms a core part of requirements specifications.
    *   Provides information for subsequent project phases.
    *   Facilitates communication between users and developers.
    *   Aids in identifying project requirements and understanding system structure.

### 1.3 Three Viewpoints of Modeling
Software views can be expressed from these perspectives:
1.  **Functional Viewpoint:** Describes what the software *does* – its functions, input/output, operations, and constraints.
2.  **Dynamic Viewpoint:** Focuses on *how* the software operates and controls. It describes system states and the events (e.g., user input, time) that cause state changes.
3.  **Information Viewpoint:** Understands the *static structure* of information. It identifies data objects, their characteristics, and relationships between them.

### 1.4 Use Case
*   **Definition:** A technique in object-oriented analysis that describes how an actor (a user or external system role) interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal. It's like a "use example."
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improves communication between customers and developers.
    *   Effectively captures customer requirements.
    *   Encourages customer participation.
    *   Helps determine functional requirements early in the project.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Actors:** Homogeneous groups of stakeholders (users or systems) with distinct roles and uses of the system.
    *   **Scenarios:** Detailed steps or flows of events within a use case, describing interactions, exchanged information, and environmental context.
*   **Purpose:** Verifies user requirements by clearly showing user-system interaction and system behavior.

### 1.5 Modeling Types (Applying the Viewpoints)

#### 1.5.1 Information Modeling (Static)
*   **Process:** Uses information from use case scenarios to identify data that needs to be stored and managed within the system.
*   **Result:** A **UML Class Diagram** (Unified Modeling Language), which shows the basic classes needed in the system, their properties (attributes), and the relationships between them.

#### 1.5.2 Dynamic Modeling
*   **Process:** Builds upon identified classes. It focuses on how objects interact and change state, finding the *operations* (methods) of classes.
*   **UML Tool:** **Sequence Diagram**.
    *   Expands on use case scenarios by showing the chronological interaction process *between objects inside* the system.
    *   Typically, one sequence diagram is created for each use case.

#### 1.5.3 Functional Modeling
*   **Process:** Deals with complex logic within the operations identified by dynamic modeling.
*   **UML Tool:** **Activity Diagram**.
    *   Expresses the various logics performed within an operation as activities.
    *   Used to understand event handling processes within a class, complex procedures, and identify additional class operations.

## 2. Object-Oriented Design and Principles

### 2.1 Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
*   **Role:** Transforms the conceptual requirements from Object-Oriented Analysis (customer viewpoint) into concrete implementation details. It describes *how* user requirements will be physically realized in the software.
*   **Advantage:** Reuses the same notation as OO analysis, minimizing conversion effort.

### 2.2 Core Object-Oriented Principles

#### 2.2.1 Object and Class
*   **Object:** An individual, tangible entity in the real world (e.g., "Mr. Kim," "Seoul"). It has specific properties and unique values that distinguish it.
*   **Class:** A blueprint or collection of similar objects that share common properties, constraints, and behaviors (e.g., "Student," "Employee").
    *   An object is an **instance** of a class.
    *   **Classification:** The act of grouping similar objects into a class.

#### 2.2.2 Encapsulation
*   **Goal:** To create software modules that are highly independent, easy to understand, and modify.
*   **Definition:** A key OO concept that bundles data (properties) and the methods (operations) that operate on the data into a single unit (an object), hiding the internal details from the outside world (**information hiding**).
*   **Benefits:** Achieves improved abstraction and independence.

#### 2.2.3 Inheritance
*   **Concept:** A mechanism where a new class (subclass) derives properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass).
*   **Generalization:** The process of identifying common properties and operations among several classes and defining a new, more general class (superclass) to contain them.
    *   **Superclass:** The parent class that shares common attributes/operations (e.g., "People").
    *   **Subclass:** The child class that inherits from the superclass and adds its unique attributes/operations (e.g., "Student," "Professor").
*   **Benefits:** Simplifies class definition, promotes code reuse, allows creating new classes from pre-defined ones.

#### 2.2.4 Polymorphism
*   **Definition:** "Many forms." It means operations with the same name can behave differently depending on the class of the object they are called on. A single function name or operator can serve multiple purposes.
*   **Context:** Primarily used in inheritance hierarchies.
*   **Mechanism:** Allows subclasses to provide their own unique implementation for an operation defined in their superclass. The superclass can call a method, and the specific subclass implementation is executed.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Overriding:** A subclass redefines a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    *   **Overloading:** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or numbers within the same class.
*   **Run-time Binding:** The determination of which specific method to execute happens automatically at runtime, based on the actual type of the object.
*   **Importance:** Crucial for understanding design patterns.

## 3. Static Modeling and Dynamic Modeling (Recap & Details)

### 3.1 Static Modeling
*   **Focus:** Reveals the unchanging, structural information of objects without considering time.
*   **Purpose:** Describes the data structure required by the system, identifying basic objects, their properties, and relationships.
*   **UML Tool:** **Class Diagram** – explicitly shows the static information structure, including classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships.
*   **Sources:** Problem descriptions and use case scenarios are used to identify classes, properties, and relationships.

### 3.2 Dynamic Modeling
*   **Focus:** Explores how objects interact and change state over time. It identifies the operations (behaviors) of classes.
*   **Purpose:** To understand system behavior and interaction processes.
*   **UML Tools:**
    *   **Sequence Diagram:** Shows the temporal sequence of messages exchanged between objects to handle events.
    *   **Collaboration Diagram:** Shows the structural organization of objects and their message exchanges, emphasizing interrelations.
        *   *Both Sequence and Collaboration diagrams are known as **Interaction Diagrams**.*
    *   **Activity Diagram:** Accurately visualizes the flow of activities, processes, and event handling within a class or system, including dependencies. Useful for complex internal object operations.

01 Object-Oriented  Analysis  and the Modeling  Concept
Object orientation  takes a given problem area as a set of objects  that are present in the real world and
represents  the interaction  between  those objects.  This can be understood  as a virtualization  process  that
moves the problem  area to the computer  world in the same way as viewing  the real world. It has the advantage
of increasing  the reusability  of an object and deepening  the understanding  of the participants.  The object-
oriented  analysis  technique  identifies  an object required  by software  by applying  three viewpoints  (information,
dynamic,  and functional  viewpoints),  and finding  the properties  and behavior  of the object. The object-oriented
development  method has the advantage  of applying  the same methodology  and expression  technique  to the
entire software  development  process,  ranging  from analysis  to design and programming.
@® What is modeling?
Modeling  is the process of simply diagraming  the performance  or operation  process  of the target system in
order to analyze  it, or expressing  the characteristics  of the target system  mathematically.  We have to express
the real world to understand  it, and modeling  enables  us to express  the real world.
We should be able to  provide software  views from various perspectives  and understand  the requirements  of
software.  Modeling  results become  the key part of the requirements  specification  and provide  the information
needed to carry  out the next phase of the project. Modeling  results are used as a tool for dialogue  between
users and developers,  and are of great help in identifying  the requirements  needed  when starting  a project  and
in understanding  the system outline and frame that are needed in the development  stage (including  design,
implementation,  and testing).
@ Three viewpoints  of modeling
The use of software  varies depending  on the view. The view of software  can be expressed  in the following
three perspectives.
<Table 18> Three viewpoints  of modeling
View Contents
The functional  model describes  a system from the viewpoint  of the functions
Functional  viewpoint performed  by software.  The functional  model is a viewpoint  about the output  of the
given input, and describes  the related  operations  and constraints.
The dynamic  viewpoint  describes  the state of the system  and the causes  of changesOe  eo (event, time, etc.) in its state by focusing  on the operation  and control of software.
The information  viewpoint  is used to understand  the static information  structure
IIOHRa  LIOR Venecint of software.  It finds an information  object used by the system  and clarifies  the
oe characteristics  of that object as well as the relations and associations  between
objects.
@ Use case
If the use case technique,  which is well-known  in object-oriented  analysis,  is used, communication  between
customers  and system developers  can be smooth and customer  requirements  can be effectively  understood.
Use cases can provide many benefits  to the various stakeholders  of a given project, including  the customer,

ESSENCE
project manager,  developers,  designers,  and so forth. By understanding  the customer  requirements  quickly,
customers  can be induced  to participate  actively  using the use case technique,  the functional  requirements  of
the system can be determined  at the beginning  of the project, and the results can be documented.
The use case technique  identifies  stakeholders,  classifies  them into homogeneous  groups according  to their
roles, and classifies  them into an actor. Each actor has a different  view and use of the system. A use case,
which is the use of the system by an individual  actor, can be identified  based on this. A use case corresponds
to a “use example’  that shows for what use (purpose)  each actor uses the system. Each use case is a set of
scenarios  used by a particular  actor to accomplish  a certain  function  or task.
Scenarios  should be created for each use case. A scenario  represents  the flow and process of an event,
and can include information  exchanged  between  systems and actors, and the situation,  environment,  and
background,  etc. in which interactions  occur. The use case technique  is used to verify user requirements
because it represents  the interaction  between  the user and the system and can clearly express  what the
system  performs.
@ Information  modeling
Information  exchanged  between  actor and system can be found using the use case scenario.  Using the
information,  information  modeling  should be performed  to identify  the information  that should be saved and
managed  inside the system, and the result should be displayed  as a class diagram  of UML (Unified Modeling
Language).  By using information  modeling,  the basic classes required  in the system can be iden...
