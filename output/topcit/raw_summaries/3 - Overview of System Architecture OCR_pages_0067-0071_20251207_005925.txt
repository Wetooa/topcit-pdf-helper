## Learning Guide: System Architecture Overview

### 1. Instruction Cycle

The **Instruction Cycle** describes the basic steps a CPU performs to execute an instruction. It involves different CPU components at each stage.

**Phases of the Instruction Cycle:**

*   **Fetch Cycle:**
    *   **Operation:** Fetches an instruction from the memory location pointed to by the Program Counter (PC).
    *   **CPU Components:** PC (Program Counter), MAR (Memory Address Register), MBR (Memory Buffer Register), IR (Instruction Register), CPU internal bus.
*   **Execution Cycle:**
    *   **Operation:** Decodes the fetched instruction and performs the required operation.
    *   **CPU Components:** AC (Accumulator), ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), Control Unit.
*   **Interruption Cycle:**
    *   **Operation:** Checks for interrupt requests, saves the current PC data onto the stack, and loads the Interrupt Service Routine's (ISR) starting address into the PC.
    *   **CPU Components:** MBR, PC, MAR, SP (Stack Pointer).
*   **Indirect Cycle:**
    *   **Operation:** Reads the actual data address from memory *before* the execution cycle begins (for instructions with indirect addressing).
    *   **CPU Components:** MAR, IR, MBR, CPU internal bus.

### 2. Instruction Set Structure: CISC vs. RISC

An **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** defines the machine language instructions a microprocessor can recognize, understand, and execute. It includes data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, etc.

The two main types of ISAs are CISC and RISC.

*   **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer):**
    *   Embeds many complex instructions into hardware.
    *   Can process complex operations as a single instruction.
*   **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer):**
    *   Embeds a few simple instructions into hardware.
    *   Processes complex operations as a set of simple instructions.

**Comparison of CISC and RISC:**

| Feature                | CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)                               | RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)                               |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction Length** | Variable length. Stores only needed info, reduces wasted code.        | Fixed to 32 bits. Easier to apply pipelining.                         |
| **Control System**     | Micro-program type (uses microcode to interpret complex instructions) | Hard-wired type (control logic implemented directly in hardware)      |
| **Compiler Structure** | Simple                                                                | Complex                                                               |
| **Number of Registers**| Few                                                                   | Many                                                                  |
| **Examples**           | Intel series (x86)                                                    | ARM, MIPS                                                             |

### 3. Memory

#### A. Memory Unit's Hierarchical Structure

Memory units are organized in a hierarchy based on speed, cost, and capacity. Levels closer to the CPU are faster, more expensive, and smaller.

**Hierarchy (from fastest/most expensive to slowest/cheapest):**

1.  **Registers:** Fastest, highest price/bit, smallest capacity, shortest access time, highest CPU access frequency.
2.  **Internal Memory (Cache):** Fast, high price/bit, small capacity, short access time, high CPU access frequency.
3.  **Main Memory (RAM):** Moderate speed/price/capacity.
4.  **External/Auxiliary Memory (e.g., HDD, SSD):** Slowest, lowest price/bit, largest capacity.

#### B. Factors for Memory Performance Evaluation

Key factors to consider when evaluating memory units:

*   **Capacity:** How much data it can store.
*   **Access Time:** Time taken to retrieve data.
*   **Cycle Time:** Minimum time between two successive memory accesses.
*   **Bandwidth:** Rate at which data can be read from or written to memory.
*   **Data Transportation:** Efficiency of moving data.
*   **Cost:** Price per bit or per unit of storage.

#### C. Types and Characteristics of Memory Units

Memory units can be classified based on various criteria:

1.  **By Usage:**
    *   **Main Memory:** Temporarily stores programs/data for CPU processing (e.g., RAM, ROM).
    *   **Auxiliary Memory:** Stores data semi-permanently, compensating for main memory's limited capacity (e.g., Magnetic disk, optical disk).
2.  **By Physical Storing Method:**
    *   **Magnetic:** Stores binary data using magnetic flux direction (e.g., Magnetic tape, Hard Disk Drive (HDD)).
    *   **Optical:** Records data on a metallic disk surface using a laser beam (e.g., CD, DVD, Blu-Ray Disk (BDA)).
    *   **Semiconductor:** Stores data using integrated circuit (IC) technology (e.g., RAM, ROM, Flash memory).
3.  **By Data Maintainability (when power is off):**
    *   **Volatile Memory:** Loses all data when power is off (e.g., RAM-based SSD).
    *   **Non-volatile Memory:** Preserves stored data even when power is off (e.g., ROM, magnetic core, auxiliary memory).
4.  **By Access Method:**
    *   **Sequential Access:** Accesses data sequentially from the beginning (e.g., Magnetic tape).
    *   **Direct Access:** Directly accesses the required location in memory (e.g., Disk, Flash memory).
5.  **By Preservation of Data (after reading):**
    *   **Destructive Read:** Stored data is destroyed after reading (e.g., Magnetic core).
    *   **Non-destructive Read:** Stored data is retained after reading (most modern memory devices).

#### D. Addressing Modes

An **address** is a specific location in main memory where data is stored. Addressing modes are methods to specify the location of an operand in an instruction, allowing for efficient use of memory and limited instruction bits.

**Types of Addressing Modes:**

*   Direct Addressing Mode
*   Indirect Addressing Mode
*   Implied Addressing Mode
*   Immediate Addressing Mode
*   Displacement Addressing Mode:
    *   Relative Addressing Mode
    *   Indexed Addressing Mode
    *   Base-Register Addressing Mode

#### E. Locality

**Locality** is the tendency for programs to access specific areas of memory intensively at a given time, rather than uniformly accessing all information.

*   **Temporal Locality:** Recently accessed programs or data are likely to be accessed again in the near future.
*   **Spatial Locality:** Data stored adjacent to a recently accessed memory location is likely to be accessed continuously.
*   **Sequential Locality:** Instructions are typically fetched and executed in the order they are stored, unless a branch occurs.

### 4. I/O Device

#### A. Concept of I/O Device

An **I/O (Input/Output) Device** is essential for:
*   **Input operations:** Storing data to be processed by the CPU into memory.
*   **Output operations:** Transferring processing results from main memory to an output medium.

#### B. I/O Controller Structure and Addressing Methods

An **I/O Controller** is a dedicated circuit that manages communication between the CPU and I/O devices.

**Roles of an I/O Controller:**

*   I/O device control and timing coordination.
*   Communication with the CPU.
*   Communication with the I/O device itself.
*   Data buffering (temporary storage of data).
*   Error detection.

**I/O Device Addressing Methods:**

Each I/O device requires at least two addresses: one for its status/control register and one for its data register. How these addresses are allocated defines the addressing method.

1.  **Memory Mapped I/O:**
    *   **Method:** A portion of the CPU's main memory address space is allocated to the I/O controller's registers.
    *   **Advantage:** Easier programming (CPU uses standard memory instructions).
    *   **Disadvantage:** Reduces the total available address space for actual memory.
2.  **I/O Mapped I/O (Port-Mapped I/O):**
    *   **Method:** The I/O device address space is entirely separate from the memory address space.
    *   **Advantage:** Does not reduce the available memory address space.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Requires special I/O instructions for the CPU, making programming more complex.

#### C. DMA (Direct Memory Access)

**Concept of DMA:**

**Direct Memory Access (DMA)** is a method that allows I/O devices to directly access the system's main memory *without* involving the CPU for each data transfer.

*   **How it Works:** A **DMA controller** manages the bus. The I/O device and memory transfer information directly, freeing up the CPU to perform other tasks. This significantly improves performance for large data transfers.
