# Database Fundamentals: Data Standards & Relational Algebra

This guide covers essential concepts of data standards and relational algebra, crucial for understanding and working with databases, especially SQL.

---

## 1. Data Standards

Data standards ensure consistency and quality across an organization's data.

### 1.1 Standard Terms

*   **What they are:** Consistent terms created by combining "standard words" from database entities (tables) and attributes (columns).
*   **How they are created:** Derived using a *standard word dictionary*, *standard domain dictionary*, and *standard code dictionary*.
*   **Structure:** Stored in a *standard term dictionary*, which is divided into an *entity term dictionary* and a *property term dictionary*.
*   **Example:** Standard words like "Customer," "classification," "code," "ID" combine to form standard terms like "Customer classification code" or "Customer ID."

### 1.2 Data Standard Review

Regularly review these dictionaries:
*   Standard word dictionary
*   Standard domain dictionary
*   Standard code dictionary
*   Standard term dictionary

### 1.3 Key Verification Criteria for Data Standards

When reviewing data standards, check for:
*   **Uniqueness:** Each data standard is physically and semantically distinct.
*   **Completeness:** All required inputs for each data standard object are defined.
*   **Accuracy:** All input items for each data standard target are correctly entered.
*   **Generality:** The defined data standard can be applied across multiple systems.

## 2. Introduction to Relational Algebra

Relational algebra is a foundational concept for understanding how relational databases process data.

### 2.1 What is Relational Algebra?

*   A set of fundamental operations used to process *relations* (tables) in a relational database.
*   **Key Characteristic:** All operands (inputs) and results of these operations are also *relations*.
*   **Procedural Language:** It specifies the *order* of operations to achieve a desired result.

### 2.2 Why is it Important?

*   **Theoretical Basis for SQL:** Relational algebra is the underlying mathematical theory for SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language for relational databases.
*   **Efficient SQL:** A deep understanding of relational algebra helps users write optimized SQL statements, prevent performance issues, and ensure queries retrieve the intended results.

### 2.3 Relational Algebra vs. Relational Calculus

*   **Relational Algebra:** *Procedural* – you specify *how* to get the data (steps).
*   **Relational Calculus:** *Non-procedural* – you specify *what* data you want, not how to get it.

---

## 3. Basic Relational Algebra Operations

These operations are typically categorized into Set Operations and Relation Operations.

### 3.1 A. Set Operations

These operations require two *mergeable* relations (i.e., they have the same number and type of attributes).

*   **Union (U):**
    *   Combines two relations.
    *   Creates a new relation containing all tuples (rows) that exist in *either* of the original relations. Duplicate tuples are removed.
*   **Intersect (∩):**
    *   Combines two relations.
    *   Creates a new relation containing only the tuples that exist in *both* of the original relations.
*   **Difference (-):**
    *   Combines two relations (e.g., A - B).
    *   Creates a new relation containing tuples that exist in the *first* relation (A) but *not* in the *second* (B).
*   **Cartesian Product (x):**
    *   Combines *all possible pairs* of tuples from two relations.
    *   The result is a new relation where each tuple from the first relation is combined with every tuple from the second relation.

### 3.2 B. Relation Operations

These operations manipulate attributes (columns) or tuples (rows) within or across relations.

*   **Select (σ):**
    *   A *unary* operation (operates on a single relation).
    *   **Purpose:** Filters rows. It selects specific *tuples* (rows) from a relation that satisfy a given condition.
    *   *Analogy:* Taking a horizontal subset of a table.
*   **Project (π):**
    *   A *unary* operation.
    *   **Purpose:** Filters columns. It selects specific *attributes* (columns) from a relation.
    *   *Analogy:* Taking a vertical subset of a table.
*   **Join (⋈):**
    *   Combines tuples from two or more relations based on a *join condition*.
    *   **Theta Join:** Uses a general join condition (e.g., =, <, >, ≠).
    *   **Equi-join:** Uses *only* the equality condition (=) for the join. The common attribute(s) used in the join condition appear *twice* in the result.
    *   **Natural Join:** A type of equi-join where the common attribute(s) appear *only once* in the result (duplicates are removed).
*   **Division (÷):**
    *   A complex operation that separates tuples from a relation (R) that are associated with *all* tuples of another relation (S).

---

## 4. Extended Relational Algebra Operations

These operations extend basic relational algebra for more complex scenarios.

*   **Outer Join:**
    *   Unlike a standard join, an outer join *includes tuples* from one or both relations even if there's no matching tuple in the other relation.
    *   Non-matching fields are filled with `NULL` values.
    *   Ensures *all* tuples from the specified side(s) of the join are included in the result.
*   **Semi Join (⋉):**
    *   Performs a natural join but *only projects the attributes of the first relation*.
    *   **Effect:** Returns tuples from the first relation that *have a match* in the second relation based on the join attributes.
*   **Outer Union:**
    *   Creates a union between two relations that *cannot be completely merged* (e.g., they have different schemas but conceptually related data).
    *   It expands the schema to accommodate all attributes, filling missing values with `NULL`.

---

## 5. SQL and Database Languages

SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases.

### 5.1 What is SQL?

*   **Structured Query Language (SQL):** Developed by IBM researchers in the early 1970s (originally SEQUEL).
*   **Purpose:** To manipulate and retrieve data stored in relational database management systems.
*   **Current Relevance:** Still the primary language for most enterprise information systems.

### 5.2 Types of SQL Languages

SQL is broadly categorized into three sub-languages:

*   **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines and manages the database structure (schema).
    *   **Examples:** `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`.
*   **Data Control Language (DCL):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages permissions and access control to the database.
    *   **Examples:** `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
*   **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
    *   **Purpose:** Manipulates data within the database tables.
    *   **Examples:** `SELECT` (querying data), `INSERT` (adding new data), `UPDATE` (modifying existing data), `DELETE` (removing data). This includes basic operations, group functions, and advanced join types.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
Relational  algebra is a set of operations  for processing  relations  in a relational  database  and has the
characteristic  that all operands  of each operation  are relations,  and the result of the operation  is also
relations.  Basic relational  algebra  operations  are usually divided into set operations  and relation  operations.
Exact understanding  of relational  algebra operations  is required to use the relational  database  efficiently
using a language  such as SQL.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain  the concept  of relational  algebra.
2. To be able to utilize set operations  and relation  operations.
3. To be able to utilize extended  relational  algebra  operations.
>> Keywords
+ Relational  operation,  relational  algebra, relational  calculus,  set operation,  relational  operation,  join,
extended  relational  algebra
+ Preview  for practical  business
Most relational  databases  used by the information  systems  of enterprises  and organizations  use SQL as
the standard  query language.  If an SQL statement  is written without  understanding  relational  algebra,
which is the theoretical  basis of SQL, the SQL statement  cannot  retrieve  the result intended  by the user,
and may degrade  performance.  Therefore,  users should fully understand  relational  algebra before writing a
more optimized  SQL statement.

01 Understanding  the Concept  of Relational  Algebra
Relational  algebra is largely divided into relational  algebra and relational  calculus.  Unlike relational  analysis,  which is a
non-procedural  language  that defines  desired information, a relation  operation  has the characteristic  of a procedural
language  because  it specifies  the order of operations  to be performed in order to obtain desired information.  In
particular,  as relational  algebra becomes  the theoretical  basis for SQL, the standard  query language  of relational
databases,  the concept  and principle  of relational  algebra need to be clearly understood.  Therefore,  this module
introduces  set operation  and relation  operation,  which constitute  the basic relational  algebra, and the extended
relational  algebra  operation.
O2 Set Operation  and Relation  Operation
Relational  algebra is a set of operations  for processing  relations  in a relational  database  and all operands  of each
operation,  and the result of the operation  is relations.  Basic relational  algebra operations  are usually divided into set
operations  and relation  operations.
A) Set operation
Set operators  include  Union, Intersect,  Difference,  and Cartesian  Product.
