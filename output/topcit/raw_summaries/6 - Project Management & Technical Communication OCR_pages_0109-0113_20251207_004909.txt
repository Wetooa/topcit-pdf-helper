## Software Project Cost Estimation & Management Guide

### 1. Function Point Analysis (FPA)

FPA estimates software development costs based on project functionality.

#### A. Adjusted Function Points (FP)

*   **Formula:** Adjusted FP Count = Unadjusted FP Count × Value Adjustment Factor (VAF)
*   **VAF:** Determined based on development/enhancement/application type.

#### B. Types of FPA

1.  **Estimated FPA:**
    *   Used in the **development proposal stage**.
    *   Calculates cost using **average values** of inputs (EI/EO/EQ) and files (ILF/EIF).
2.  **Detailed FPA:**
    *   Applied **after the demand analysis and design stages**.
    *   Uses a **traditional method** with weighted average complexity ratings (High/Avg/Low).
*   **Usage:** FPA is often used in public projects to estimate costs based on user functional requirements.

### 2. Man/Month (MM) Method

MM measures labor consumed based on similar project experience to calculate cost.

#### A. Project Development Cost Components

*   **Formula:** Project Development Cost = Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost + Royalty + Direct Cost

#### B. Cost Breakdown

1.  **Direct Labor Cost:**
    *   **Definition:** Cost of manpower directly assigned to work packages (lowest unit of WBS).
    *   **Calculation:** Determined by multiplying required labor by unit price per labor (e.g., average wage of a software engineer published by industry associations).
2.  **Overhead Cost:**
    *   **Definition:** Indirect expenses for administrative operations (planning, management, general affairs).
    *   **Calculation:** Usually **110% to 120%** of the direct labor cost.
3.  **Royalty:**
    *   **Definition:** Payment for using technology developed and owned by the software developer.
    *   **Calculation:** Usually **20% to 40%** of the sum of Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost.
4.  **Direct Cost:**
    *   **Definition:** Expenses directly required for software development.
    *   **Examples:** Royalties for computer systems/software tools, professional fees, travel, materials.

#### C. Usage

*   Commonly used in **private projects** to calculate development costs.
*   Can be used for **mutual verification** with FPA.

### 3. COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

COCOMO is a software project cost estimation method using regression formulas with parameters like development period, man-months, and maintenance costs.

#### A. Types of COCOMO Models (by calculation complexity)

1.  **Basic:** Simplest, for early estimations.
2.  **Intermediate:** More detailed, includes cost drivers.
3.  **Detailed:** Most comprehensive, includes phase-dependent cost drivers.

#### B. Types of Applied Projects (by project characteristics)

1.  **Organic Mode:** Relatively small, simple projects with experienced teams working in a stable environment.
2.  **Semi-Detached Mode:** Medium-sized projects, mix of experienced and inexperienced personnel.
3.  **Embedded Mode:** Complex projects, tightly constrained hardware/software, often in a novel environment.

#### C. Basic COCOMO Calculation Method

*   **Effort Applied (E):** Estimated man-months required.
    *   **Formula:** E = a * (KLOC)^b
    *   **KLOC (Kilo Line Of Code):** Estimated number of delivered lines of code in thousands.
    *   `a` and `b` are coefficients that vary by project type (Organic, Semi-Detached, Embedded).
*   **Development Time (D):** Estimated time to complete the project.
    *   **Formula:** D = c * (Effort Applied)^d
    *   `c` and `d` are coefficients that vary by project type.
*   **People Required (P):** Average staff size.
    *   **Formula:** P = Effort Applied / Development Time

*   **Intermediate & Detailed COCOMO:** Use the same core formulas but modify coefficient values and incorporate additional cost drivers for more accuracy.

### 4. COCOMO 2 (Constructive Cost Model 2)

COCOMO 2 is an improved version of COCOMO, adapted for modern development environments by considering factors like code reusability and component-based development.

#### A. Sub-Models of COCOMO 2

1.  **Application Composition Model:**
    *   **Application:** Projects using GUI/CASE tools for software prototyping.
    *   **Estimates based on:** Component count, complexity, object points.
2.  **Early Design Model:**
    *   **Application:** Used for approximate cost/schedule estimation in the **early design stage** when detailed information is limited.
    *   **Used when:** Insufficient details on scale, environment, manpower, and process.
3.  **Post-Architecture Model:**
    *   **Application:** Used after architecture is established and sufficient data is available.
    *   **Estimates based on:** Unadjusted function points and SLOC (Source Line Of Code) after the software life cycle establishment.

### 5. Cost Management Technique - Earned Value Management (EVM)

EVM is a project performance management technique that integrates project schedule and cost to analyze performance and predict final project cost and schedule.

#### A. Concept of Earned Value

*   **Value:** Monetary worth of work, equivalent to the budgeted cost allocated to the work.
*   **Earned Value (EV) / Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP):** The value of the work *actually* completed at a given point in time.

#### B. Key Terms of EVM

| Term | Explanation                                                                                                 | Formula / Interpretation                                   |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PV** | **Planned Value:** The approved (planned) budget for work scheduled to be completed by a given date.        |                                                            |
| **EV** | **Earned Value:** The budgeted cost of the work actually performed.                                         |                                                            |
| **AC** | **Actual Cost:** The costs actually incurred for the work completed to date.                                |                                                            |
| **SV** | **Schedule Variance:** Measures actual progress against expected progress.                                  | **SV = EV - PV** <br/> > 0: Ahead of schedule <br/> < 0: Behind schedule |
| **SPI** | **Schedule Performance Index:** Ratio of work earned to work planned.                                       | **SPI = EV / PV** <br/> > 1: On or ahead of schedule <br/> < 1: Behind schedule |
| **CV** | **Cost Variance:** Measures actual cost against the budgeted cost for work performed.                       | **CV = EV - AC** <br/> > 0: Under budget <br/> < 0: Over budget |
| **CPI** | **Cost Performance Index:** Ratio of work earned to actual cost.                                            | **CPI = EV / AC** <br/> > 1: On or under budget <br/> < 1: Over budget |

#### C. EVM Graph Interpretation

*   A typical EVM graph plots Cumulative Cost (AC, PV, EV) against the Project Schedule.
*   **SV** is the vertical distance between EV and PV.
*   **CV** is the vertical distance between EV and AC.
*   If EV is below PV, the project is behind schedule (SV < 0).
*   If EV is below AC, the project is over budget (CV < 0).

#### D. Estimate At Completion (EAC)

*   **Definition:** The estimated total cost of the project at its completion.
*   **Formula:** EAC = Actual Cost (AC) + Estimate To Complete (ETC)
*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):** The estimated cost of the remaining work.

#### E. Methods to Calculate ETC

1.  **Using CPI:**
    *   Assumes future work will be completed at the same cost performance as past work.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = (Budget at Completion (BAC) - Earned Value (EV)) / Cost Performance Index (CPI)
2.  **Applying Original Budget without Change:**
    *   Assumes remaining work will be completed as originally budgeted.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = (Budget at Completion (BAC) - Earned Value (EV))
3.  **New Estimate:**
    *   Used when past performance is irrelevant, and a new, detailed estimate for the remaining work is created.
    *   **Formula:** ETC = New estimate for the remaining work

@ Determination  of Adjusted  Function  Points
+ When the value adjustment  factor (VAF) is determined,  the final adjusted  FP is calculated  by reflecting  the
VAF according  to the development/enhance  /application  type
+ Adjusted  FP Count = Unadjusted  FP Count x VAF
Function  Point Analysis  (FPA) is largely divided into Estimated  FPA and Detailed  FPA. In the development
proposal  stage, cost is calculated  using the average  values of El/EO/EQ  and ILF/EIF, while the cost is calculated
using the traditional  method  after the stage of demand  analysis  and design.
Function  Point Analysis
+ Based on weighted  average  complexity  rating + High/Avg/Low  complexity  determined
+ Applied  to the planning  and acquisition  stages + Applied  after the design stage
[Figure 37] Function  Point Analysis  Method
In recent practice,  in the case of public projects,  cost estimation  is carried out focusing  on user's functional
requirements  by utilizing  the FPA.
B) Man/Month  (MM)
Man/Month  is a method  of measuring  how much labor is consumed  in a project based on previous  experience
in similar  projects,  and calculating  the cost based on the manpower  put into the project.
Project  development  cost = direct labor cost + overhead  cost + Royalty+  direct cost
Generally,  required manpower  resources  are allocated  for each work package,  the lowest unit of the WBS
derived  from scope management.
@ Direct Labor Cost
When the required  labor is allocated  for each work package,  the unit price per labor must be determined.  In the
case of Korea, the average  wage of a software  engineer  published  by Korea Software  Industry  Association  is
applied,  which is determined  by referring  to the table below.
<Table 47> Average  Wage for SW Engineers  in 2017

@ Overhead  Cost and Royalty
Overhead  cost is indirect expenses’  incurred in the areas of planning,  management,  and general affairs for the
administrative operation  of the software  developer.  Usually, it is calculated  as 110 to 120% of the direct labor
cost. Royalty  is an amount  paid in exchange  for the use and accumulation  of technology  developed  and owned
by the software  developer,  and it is calculated  as 20 to 40% of the sum of direct labor cost plus overhead
cost?
@ Direct Cost
Direct cost refers to expenses  directly required  for software  development,  such as royalties  for computer
system or software  tools, software,  professional  expenses,  travel expenses,  and materials  costs, etc. directly
incurred  for the software  development  project.
In the field of private projects,  the man month calculation  is used to calculate  project development  cost,
and also for mutual verification  interchangeably  with the function  point analysis,  which has recently become
mandatory  in public projects.
C) COCOMO(Constructive  Cost Model)
COCOMO  is one of the estimation  methods  of the cost of a software  development  project. It calculates  the
cost by using a regression  formula  with parameters  such as development  period, man per month, and mainte-
nance costs that are put into the modules  and subsystems  that make up the system.
COCOMO  is divided into three types: Basic, Intermediate,  and Detailed,  depending  on the complexity  of the
calculation  model. In addition,  it is divided into three types: Organic  Mode, Semi-Detached  Mode, and Embed-
ded Mode, according  to the type of applied project. Each is calculated  by taking into account  the effort, devel-
opment  time, average  staff size and productivity.
A brief look at the COCOMO  calculation  method  is as follows:
Case of the Basic COCOMO  model
@ Effort Applied)  E = a * (KLOC)  >
*aand  b are coefficients  by project  type (see table below)
* KLOC (Kilo Line Of Code) is the estimated  number  of delivered  lines of code in thousands
