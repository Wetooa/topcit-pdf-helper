# Information Security: Cryptographic Basics

## 1. Cryptographic Protocols

*   **Definition:** Protocols that use cryptographic techniques to achieve secure communication.
*   **Purpose:** Ensure specific goals like:
    *   Authentication (verifying identity)
    *   Confidentiality (keeping info secret)
    *   Integrity (ensuring info hasn't been tampered with)
    *   Non-repudiation (preventing denial of actions)
*   **Key Requirement:** Prevent repudiation by participants or third parties.

## 2. Cryptographic Techniques: Classification & Applications

*   **Underlying Mathematical Problems:**
    *   Factoring Problem (e.g., used in RSA)
    *   Discrete Logarithm Problem (e.g., used in ElGamal)
    *   Elliptic Curve Problem (e.g., used in ECC)
*   **Applications:**
    *   Individual Identification & Authentication
    *   Electronic Signature
    *   Electronic Payment
    *   Electronic Money
    *   Electronic Election

## 3. Cryptographic Algorithms & Cryptosystems

### 3.1. Cryptographic Algorithm

*   **Core Idea:** Uses an encryption key to transform plaintext into ciphertext.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Encryption:** Plaintext (P) + Encryption Key (KE) + Encryption Function (E) → Ciphertext (C)
    2.  **Decryption:** Ciphertext (C) + Decryption Key (KD) + Decryption Function (D) → Plaintext (P)
*   **Keys:**
    *   **Symmetric (Private Key):** KE and KD are the *same* key.
    *   **Asymmetric (Public Key):** KE and KD are *different* keys.
*   **Goal:** Ensure confidentiality when transmitting data over insecure networks.
*   **Computational Impossibility:** It should be practically impossible to decrypt ciphertext without the correct decryption key, even if given unlimited time (though attackers will always try various methods).

### 3.2. Cryptosystem

*   **Definition:** All necessary elements for the entire encryption and decryption process.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Efficient encryption and decryption using the key.
    *   Easy to use.
    *   Security should primarily rely on the **strength of the key**, not just the secrecy or complexity of the algorithm itself.

## 4. Private Key (Symmetric) Cryptographic Algorithms

*   **Key Relationship:** The encryption key and decryption key are **identical**.
*   **Process:**
    *   Sender encrypts with Key.
    *   Receiver decrypts with the *same* Key.
*   **Terminology:** Also known as Secret Key Encryption, Conventional Encryption, or Symmetric Encryption.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Fast encryption and decryption speed.
    *   Relatively short key lengths.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Key Distribution:** Difficult to securely share the secret key, especially over long distances or with many users.
    *   **Key Management:** Burdensome to generate and maintain separate keys for every pair of communicating parties.
*   **Why still used:** Its speed, due to its composition of substitution and transposition operations.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Block Cipher:** Processes data in fixed-size blocks.
    *   **Stream Cipher:** Processes data bit by bit.

### 4.1. Block Cipher

*   **Method:** Transforms fixed-size input blocks into fixed-size output blocks using a secret key.
*   **Examples:** Feistel Network, DES, AES, IDEA, SEED, ARIA.
*   **Common Attack Techniques:**
    *   **Differential Attack:** Analyzes bit differences between plaintext and corresponding ciphertext blocks to find the key.
    *   **Linear Attack:** Linearizes internal non-linear structures of the algorithm to deduce the key.
    *   **Brute Force Attack:** Tries every possible key until the correct one is found (plaintext matches ciphertext).
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Uses statistical properties (e.g., letter frequency) of ciphertext to decrypt.
    *   **Mathematical Analysis:** Applies mathematical theories to break the cipher.

### 4.2. Stream Cipher

*   **Method:** Creates ciphertext by performing a bitwise XOR operation between plaintext bits and a generated key stream.
*   **Examples:** RC4 (representative), A5/1, A5/2.

### 4.3. Comparison: Block Cipher vs. Stream Cipher

| Item                | Block Cipher                                      | Stream Cipher                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Operating Method**| Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks                | Encrypts plaintext bit by bit                   |
| **Strengths**       | Easy to implement                                 | Easy to implement in mobile environments        |
| **Shortcomings**    | Slow execution time (compared to stream)          | Malicious attackers can easily modify content   |
|                     | High risk of error spread (in certain modes)      | Requires careful management of initial values   |

## 5. Public Key (Asymmetric) Cryptographic Algorithms

*   **Origin:** Concept introduced by Diffie and Hellman (1976), RSA developed (1978).
*   **Key Relationship:** Uses **different keys** for encryption and decryption.
*   **Key Pair:** Each user has:
    *   **Public Key:** Disclosed and used by others to encrypt data *for* that user.
    *   **Private Key:** Kept secret by the user and used to decrypt data encrypted *with their public key*.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Sender encrypts data using the **receiver's public key**.
    2.  Receiver decrypts the data using **their own private key**.
*   **Key Mechanism:** Anyone can encrypt information using a public key, but only the owner of the corresponding private key can decrypt it.
*   **Key Management (for 'n' users):**
    *   Total keys in network: 2n (each user has one public, one private).
    *   Keys managed *by each person*: Each user primarily manages their own private key, and their own public key (which is shared).
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Key Distribution:** Simple and secure key distribution, as public keys can be openly shared.
    *   **Authentication:** Useful for verifying identities because only the private key owner can decrypt specific messages.
    *   **Key Exchange:** Facilitates secure exchange of secret keys for symmetric encryption.
    *   Fewer total *unique* keys to manage for N communicating parties compared to symmetric systems (2N vs. N(N-1)/2).

### 5.1. Representative Public Key Algorithms

*   **RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman):**
    *   **Purpose:** Encryption and authentication.
    *   **Security Basis:** Difficulty of **factoring large integers**.
    *   **Characteristic:** Produces the *same ciphertext* for the same message because it doesn't use random numbers during encryption.
    *   **Key Importance:** Security heavily depends on the selection of large prime numbers (p and q).
*   **ElGamal:**
    *   **Proposed:** 1984.
    *   **Security Basis:** Difficulty of the **discrete logarithm problem**.
    *   **Characteristic:** Ciphertext length is doubled. Importantly, it produces *different ciphertext* each time for the same message because it uses random numbers, enhancing security.
*   **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem):**
    *   **Security Basis:** Discrete logarithm problem on **elliptic curves**.
    *   **Advantages:** High security and fast speed.
    *   **Efficiency:** A 160-bit ECC key offers comparable security to a 1024-bit RSA key.
    *   **Suitability:** Ideal for mobile devices and environments with limited power (e.g., mobile phones).

| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |

| **Number of Keys (N users)**  | N(N-1)/2 (for pairwise communication)           | 2N (each user has 1 public, 1 private)            |
| **Keys Managed per Person**   | N-1 (one secret key for each partner)           | 2 (their own private and public key pair)         |
| **Encryption Speed**          | High speed                                      | Low speed (slower than private key ciphers)       |
| **Key Distribution**          | Complex (requires secure prior agreement)       | Simple (public keys can be freely shared)         |
| **Strengths**                 | High speed; relatively simple algorithm.        | Easy key distribution; supports authentication; fewer total unique keys to manage for the network. |

@ Cryptographic  protocols
Cryptographic  protocols  refer to the protocols  that use cryptographic  techniques.  As a protocol  means a series
of finite phases in which more than 2 persons participate  to achieve a certain purpose,  the cryptographic
protocol  should prevent repudiation  by  a participant,  or a third party, to ensure a certain purpose  of the
concerned  cryptographic  protocol  (authentication,  confidentiality,  integrity,  and non-repudiation,  etc.), as well
as the meaning  of each message.

D) Cryptographic  algorithm  and cryptosystem
® Cryptographic  algorithm
The cryptographic  algorithm  that uses an encryption  key can be described  as [Figure 5]. In the figure, P is plain
text, E is the cryptographic  function,  and K(KE, KD) is the key value. As in the public key method,  the encryption
key and the decryption  key can be different.  In that case, keys are expressed  KE and KD respectively.  Since
ciphertext  is generally  transmitted  over the communication  line or network  that is not secure, the sender  and
receiver  can ensure  confidentiality  by transmitting  the result of encrypting  the plaintext.

ESSENCE
The receiver  tries to send plaintext  P, which can be seen by anyone,  to the other party. The sender  generates
ciphertext  C from plaintext  P using the encryption  key KE and the cryptographic  algorithm  E,then delivers  it to
the receiver.  In general,  we cannot  understand  ciphertext  C without  knowing  the decryption  key, which is called
computational  impossibility.  Here, the computational  impossibility  means that we can understand  the contents
of the plaintext,  even though  we don’t know the decryption  key, if infinite time is used. The attacker  attempts
to understand  the contents  of the plaintext  using various methods.  The legitimate  receiver  can understand
plain text P that the sender has initially intended  to send, by receiving  ciphertext  C sent by the sender and
converting  it using the decryption  key KD and decryption  algorithm  D.
@ Cryptosystem
All the elements  that are needed  for a series of encryption  and decryption  processes  are called a “cryptosystem”.
The cryptosystem  should generally  meet the following  requirements:
+ Encryption  and decryption  should be effectively  performed  by the encryption  key.
+ A cryptosystem  should be easy to use.
+ Security  should be performed  by the encryption  key, rather  than by a cryptographic  algorithm.
E) Private key encryption  and public key cryptographic  algorithm
@ Private key cryptographic  algorithm
The secret key encryption  algorithm  has the advantage  that the encryption  key used for encryption  and the
decryption  key used for decryption  are the same, and that the length of the key may be short, and the speed
of encryption  and decryption  operations  is fast.

[Figure  6] Private key cryptographic  algorithm
However,  it is difficult to share the key if the distance  between  the sender  and the receiver  is long. If there are
many other parties who require encrypted  communication,  it is quite burdensome  to generate  and maintain
different  keys. It is called a private key encryption  system, in the sense that the key should be kept and
managed  in secret.It  is also called a conventional  encryption  system,  in the sense that it is commonly  used.
The private key encryption  system is still widely used, even though it is difficult  to share the key, because
the cryptographic  algorithm  is composed  of a combination  of substitution  and transposition,  enabling  fast
operations.  In addition,  this system is divided into the block cipher and the stream cipher, as shown in Table 2,
depending  on the plaintext  processing  method.
