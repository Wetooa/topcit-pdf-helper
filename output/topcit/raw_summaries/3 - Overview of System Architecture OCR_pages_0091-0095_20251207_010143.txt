## Learning Guide: System Architecture & Data Management

### 1. Disk Scheduling Algorithms

These algorithms manage how a disk head services requests to minimize access time.

*   **SCAN Disk Scheduling (Elevator Algorithm)**
    *   **Concept:** The disk head moves in one direction, servicing all requests in its path.
    *   **Action:** When it reaches the outermost or innermost cylinder, it reverses direction.
    *   **Benefits:** Reduces response time variation, offers good throughput and mean response time, solves starvation (unlike SSTF).
    *   **Example:** Services 53 -> 60 -> 120 -> 183 (then reverses) or 53 -> 37 (then reverses).

*   **LOOK Disk Scheduling**
    *   **Concept:** Similar to SCAN, but more efficient.
    *   **Action:** The head *changes direction early* if there are no more requests in its current moving direction, *without* reaching the absolute outermost or innermost cylinder.

*   **Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) Disk Scheduling**
    *   **Concept:** Services requests in a predetermined, single direction only.
    *   **Action:** After servicing all requests in one direction, the head "jumps" back to the initial/opposite end *without servicing* requests on the return path, then starts servicing again from that end. This creates a "circular" movement.
    *   **Benefits:** Improves SCAN by providing a more consistent and predictable response time for all requests, reducing response time variation.

*   **Circular LOOK (C-LOOK) Disk Scheduling**
    *   **Concept:** Combines C-SCAN's circular nature with LOOK's efficiency.
    *   **Action:** The head moves in a predetermined direction, servicing requests. When no more requests exist in that direction, it "jumps" back to the furthest pending request in the opposite direction *without servicing* during the jump, and without reaching the absolute end of the disk.

### 2. High Availability Storage

#### A) Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) Technology

RAID uses multiple disks to improve performance and reliability.

*   **Definition:** A storage technology that links multiple physical disks to act as a single logical unit, minimizing failure factors and improving access performance.
*   **Main Features:**
    *   **Improved Availability:** Supports hot-swapping (replacing a failed disk without system shutdown) and online data recovery.
    *   **Increased Capacity:** Combines several disks into a large virtual disk.
    *   **Increased Speed:** Partitions data and transfers it in parallel to multiple disks, increasing overall data transfer rate.
*   **Widely Used RAID Levels:** RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-6, RAID-10.

---

**RAID Levels in Detail:**

*   **RAID-0 (Striped Disk Array without Fault Tolerance)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Data is divided into "stripes" (pieces of a specific size) and stored across two or more drives simultaneously (disk striping).
    *   **Pros:** Significantly increases I/O speed due to parallel processing.
    *   **Cons:** **No redundancy/fault tolerance.** If *any* drive fails, all data is lost. Not suitable for critical business environments alone.

*   **RAID-1 (Mirroring and Duplexing)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Data is redundantly stored on two separate drives (mirroring). Each piece of data is duplicated.
    *   **Pros:** High data stability; data can be restored if one drive fails. Improves reading performance.
    *   **Cons:** High cost (only half of the physical capacity is usable, as the other half is for redundancy). Writing performance can be lower due to writing to two places.

*   **RAID-5 (Striping with Distributed Parity)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Requires at least three drives. Data and parity information (for error checking/recovery) are striped and distributed across *all* drives.
    *   **Improvement:** Distributes the parity load across all drives, unlike RAID-4 which used a dedicated parity drive.
    *   **Pros:** Good balance of cost-effectiveness and performance.
    *   **Cons:** Data cannot be restored if two or more drives fail simultaneously. Rebuilding data on a new drive can be slow, increasing risk.

*   **RAID-6 (Stripe Set with Dual Distributed Parity)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Similar to RAID-5, but stores *two* independent parities distributed across all drives.
    *   **Pros:** More durable and safer than RAID-5; can tolerate *two* simultaneous drive failures. This is crucial for large systems where a second drive failure during a lengthy rebuild process is a risk.
    *   **Cons:** Slightly higher overhead than RAID-5 due to dual parity.

*   **RAID-10 (Striping & Mirroring)**
    *   **Mechanism:** A combination of RAID-0 and RAID-1, requiring at least four drives.
        *   **RAID 1+0:** First, drives are mirrored (RAID-1 sets), then these mirrored sets are striped together (RAID-0).
        *   **RAID 0+1:** First, drives are striped (RAID-0 sets), then these striped sets are mirrored (RAID-1). RAID 1+0 generally offers better stability and is more common.
    *   **Pros:** Provides both high I/O speed (from RAID-0) and high data stability/redundancy (from RAID-1). Overcomes the main drawbacks of RAID-0 (no fault tolerance) and RAID-1 (high cost/performance limit).
    *   **Cons:** Very high cost due to significant redundancy (half of the drives are for mirroring).

#### B) Backup Storage Solutions

*   **Linear Tape-Open (LTO)**
    *   **Definition:** An industry-standard open tape drive technology for data storage.
    *   **Features:** Supports high-speed data processing and very large storage capacity.
    *   **Evolution:**
        *   LTO-1 (2000): 100 GB uncompressed capacity, 20 MB/s speed.
        *   LTO-8 (Current): 12.8 TB uncompressed capacity, 427 MB/s speed.
        *   LTO-10 (Expected): 48 TB uncompressed capacity, 1100 MB/s speed.

*   **Virtual Tape Library (VTL)**
    *   **Definition:** A backup solution that uses disk storage to *emulate* a physical tape library.
    *   **Purpose:** Addresses limitations of traditional physical tape backups (e.g., performance, scalability, recovery time).
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies backup processes and enables high-speed backups through tape virtualization (using disk performance for tape-like operations).

### 3. Graphic Compression Technology

Methods to reduce the size of video and image data.

*   **Lossless Compression (Reversible Compression)**
    *   **Concept:** A compression method where the original data can be perfectly restored without any loss of information during decompression.
    *   **Characteristic:** Achieves a lower compression rate compared to lossy compression.

*   **Lossy Compression (Irreversible Compression)**
    *   **Concept:** A compression method where some data is permanently discarded during compression.
    *   **Characteristic:** The decompressed data will not be identical to the original data, but the perceived quality may still be acceptable (e.g., for images, video). Achieves higher compression rates.

of the moving  head. It can reduce the response  time variation  of SSTF, and it generally  offers excellent  throughput
per unit time and mean response  time. On determining  the heading  direction,  the head services  all the requests
waiting  in the request  queue in the same direction  as the order of the shortest  search distance,  and it changes  the
seeking  direction  after it reaches  the outermost  or innermost  cylinder. It has improved  both the throughput  per unit
time and the response  time significantly  compared  to SSTF, and it solved the starvation.

The technique  is the same as the SCAN disk scheduling,  except  that the head changes  its direction  before reaching
the outermost  or innermost  cylinder. It checks the waiting queue while moving  the head, and it does not move

[Figure  63] LOOK Disk Scheduling
@ Circular  SCAN (C-SCAN)  disk scheduling
The SCAN technique  moves the head by connecting  the inner and outer tracks in a circular  model. Like SCAN disk
scheduling,  the head services  the request  with the shortest  distance  in its moving  direction  first, then it moves  to the
initial direction  to service requests  after all the requests  in the moving  direction  are serviced.  It services  all requests
in a predetermined  service direction.  Since it responds  equally  to input and output requests  by improving  the SCAN
scheduling,  the response  time variation  is very small, making  it easy to predict  the response  time.
Circular  LOOK (C-LOOK)  disk scheduling
Like C-SCAN,  it is a LOOK scheduling  technique  that connects  the inner and outer tracks in an annular  model in order
to make the head move. The head moves to the initial beginning  position  and services  the next requests,  if there are

no more requests  in the moving  direction,  even when the head does not reach the end.
03 High Availability  Storage
A) Redundant  array of independent  disks (RAID)  technology
Large-capacity  storage systems  generally  have an error controller  and backup  function  to safely store the massive
volume of data. RAID technology  is a storage  technology  that minimizes  the factors  that can cause failure, and it
improves  access performance  by arranging  a number  of disks, and by creating  a separate  disk unit by linking them
with each other
The main features  of RAID are improved  availability,  increased  capacity,  and increased  speed. Firstly, the improved
availability  feature provides  a hot-swap  function  to replace  a failed disk without  shutting  down the system, and it
recovers  the original data to the replaced  disk online. Secondly,  the increased  capacity  feature  organizes  several disks
into a large virtual disk, and it recognizes  them as large-capacity  storage  disks. Thirdly, the increased  speed improves
the overall data transfer  rate by partitioning  reading  and writing  data, and by transferring  it to multiple  disks in parallel.
RAID implementation  includes  RAID-O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-6,  and RAID-10  (1+0 or O+1)
are widely  used technologies,  while RAID-2,  RAID-3,  and RAID-4  are rarely used.
@ RAID-O  (Striped  disk array without  fault tolerance)
RAID-O  consists  of two or more drives and uses disk striping,  which stores data by dividing  it into pieces of a specific
size and saves it on multiple  disks at once. Although  it increases  the I/O speed, it cannot  protect  data because  there
is no redundancy.  A stripe, which means the size of the stored data, is a unit for dividing  data into pieces of a specific
size. RAID-O can reduce the I/O time by enabling  parallel processing  of I/O requests.  However,  data is lost if any drive
fails. Although  the technology  is not used much in business  environments,  RAID-10  uses it by taking its advantages
and overcoming  its disadvantages.

ESSENCE
@ RAID-1 (Mirroring  and Duplexing)
RAID-1 uses a mirroring  technique  that redundantly  stores data on two drives. Since data is stored in redundancy,
data can be restored,  even if a drive fails. It can improve  the reading  performance,  but the writing performance  is
somewhat  low, since it performs  reading  operations  on a drive with low I/O. Although  the system is highly stable, the
cost is high because  only half of the physical  capacity  can be used, as the other half is used for redundant  storage.
