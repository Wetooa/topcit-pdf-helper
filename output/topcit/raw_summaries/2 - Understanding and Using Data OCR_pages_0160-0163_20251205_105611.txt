## Machine Learning & Deep Learning Essentials

### I. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

*   **Definition:** An artificial neural network.
*   **Structure:** Composed of multiple layers, including input, hidden (one or more), and output layers. Sigmoid neurons are commonly used.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Maps discrete or consecutive input signals to output signals.
    *   Uses error correction for learning.
    *   Strong against noise.
*   **Visual:** Typically depicted with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

### II. Unsupervised Learning

**Purpose:** To find patterns or structures in data without pre-labeled outputs.

#### A. Clustering

*   **Definition:** A technique to group closely related data into subsets called clusters.
*   **Key Algorithms:**
    1.  **K-means Clustering:**
        *   **Method:** Classifies data into similar groups by measuring the distance of data points from the center of each cluster.
    2.  **Hierarchical Clustering (HC):**
        *   **Method:** Divides all data into a hierarchical structure.
        *   **Usefulness:** Particularly useful for visualizing multidimensional data.

### III. Deep Learning

#### A. Background & Definition

*   **Definition:** An advanced AI technology that enables computers to learn autonomously, similar to human learning.
*   **Approach:** Combines existing supervised learning (requiring human intervention) with more active unsupervised learning.
*   **Foundation:** Based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) theory.
*   **Emergence Factors:**
    *   **Addressing Machine Learning Limitations:**
        *   **Lack of Training Data:** Solved by leveraging Big Data analysis (variety/volume, Hadoop algorithms).
        *   **Overfitting Problem:** Mitigated through techniques like regularization and Backpropagation.
        *   **Lack of Computing Power:** Overcome by advancements in GPU computing, CUDA, and parallel processing hardware.
    *   **Applications:**
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP).
        *   Pattern analysis (e.g., video, photo recognition).

#### B. Deep Learning Algorithms

1.  **DNN (Deep Neural Network)**
    *   **Characteristics:** An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with **multiple hidden layers** between the input and output layers.
    *   **Purpose:** To build complex and expressive models, overcoming the limitations of simpler ANNs.

2.  **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
    *   **Characteristics:** A neural network specifically structured for **image data processing**.
    *   **Inspiration:** Mimics the mechanical principle of the organism's optic nerve.
    *   **Typical Layers:** Convolutional layer > Pooling layer > Convolutional layer > Pooling layer > Fully Connected (feedforward) layer.

3.  **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
    *   **Characteristics:** A neural network where connections between units form a **directed cycle**.
    *   **Function:** Generates multiple output values from a single input by establishing relationships.
    *   **Mechanism:** Connects the neural network at the previous time step (T-1) with the current time step (T).
    *   **Learning:** Uses an algorithm called **Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT)**, an extension of the standard error back-propagation.

4.  **RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine)**
    *   **Characteristics:** A **generative graphical model** used for machine learning.
    *   **Structure:** A type of Boltzmann machine consisting of a separate visible layer and a hidden layer.
    *   **Role:** Often used as a building block for more complex deep learning networks like DBNs.

5.  **DBN (Deep Belief Network)**
    *   **Characteristics:** A deep neural network composed of **multiple layers of latent variables**.
    *   **Learning Technique:** Stacks multiple **Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)** for learning.
    *   **Structure:** Learns by stacking RBMs, where each RBM has its own visible and hidden layers, often with a "top layer" representing the highest-level hidden layer.
