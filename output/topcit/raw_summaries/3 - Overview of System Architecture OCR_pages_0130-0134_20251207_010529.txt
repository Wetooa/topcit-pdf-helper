*   **Modern IT Landscape:** Cloud computing and virtualization are now essential technologies.
*   **Key Trendsetters:**
    *   Gartner identified virtualization as a strategic technology in 2006, and cloud computing in 2009.
    *   AWS, launched in 2006, demonstrates the immense growth and necessity of cloud services.
*   **Foundation for New Technologies:** AI, Big Data, and Blockchain largely rely on cloud services for their scalability and speed.
*   **Evolution of Server Virtualization:**
    *   **Traditional:** Hypervisor-based virtualization.
    *   **Recent:** Container-type virtualization (e.g., Linux Containers (LxC), Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift) is gaining popularity due to being lighter and faster.

### 2. Understanding Cloud Computing

#### 2.1 Definition & Core Concept

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Efficiently use surplus computer capacity.
    *   Flexibly respond to uncertain service demands.
*   **Core Idea:** Users access virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networks, software) via the Internet as needed, without needing to own or manage the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Key Advantage:** Provides computing resources through a network in an "invisible" state, allowing users to work anywhere without knowing complex infrastructure details.

#### 2.2 Expected Benefits of Cloud Services

*   **Costs:**
    *   **CAPEX (Capital Expenditure):** Reduced (less upfront investment in hardware).
    *   **OPEX (Operating Expenditure):** May increase (pay-as-you-go model).
    *   **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership):** Reduced (lower overall system ownership and maintenance costs).
*   **Period:** Reduced development time and product development cycles.
*   **Operation:** Fewer operating personnel needed, improved resource efficiency.
*   **Product:** Enhanced product integration capabilities.

#### 2.3 Cloud Computing vs. Cloud Service (TTA Definitions)

*   **Cloud Service:** An on-demand, outsourced IT service that provides a user-centered cloud computing environment.
*   **Cloud Computing:** A computing environment that leases IT resources through the Internet, based on virtualization and distributed processing technology, with fees paid based on usage.

### 3. Cloud Computing Comparisons with Other Technologies

#### 3.1 Cloud Computing vs. Grid Computing

*   **Similarities:** Both use a distributed computing structure and provide virtualized computing resources.
*   **Grid Computing Definition:** A structure for virtualizing and integrating resources (computers, data) on a network to dynamically create virtual computers as needed.
*   **Key Differences:**

| Feature                | Grid Computing                                   | Cloud Computing                                |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Computer Location**  | Geographically scattered, managed by different organizations | Geographically scattered, managed by a central organization |
| **Computer Config.**   | Heterogeneous mixture                           | Mostly homogeneous (same model)                |
| **Standardization**    | Existing standards for resource/data management | None                                           |
| **Interconnectivity**  | Important                                       | Not a primary consideration                    |
| **Resource Ownership** | Uses all computer resources on the Internet     | Uses *only* resources owned by the operator    |
| **Usage**              | Highly parallel apps (scientific, technical)    | General-purpose applications (e.g., web apps)  |

#### 3.2 Cloud Computing vs. Utility Computing

*   **Similarities:** Both charge for resources used.
*   **Utility Computing Definition:** Provides computing resources and charges based on the resources consumed.
*   **Relationship:** Cloud computing evolved by abstracting computing resources, building upon the concept of utility computing.

### 4. Cloud Computing Service Types (XaaS Models)

Cloud services are classified into three main types based on what they provide:

#### 4.1 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

*   **What it Provides:** Fundamental infrastructure resources (servers, storage, network) as a service over the Internet.
*   **Virtualization:** Typically a virtualized environment, but can also be non-virtualized physical resources (**bare-metal cloud**).
*   **User Responsibility:** Users must directly manage everything *above* the virtualization layer, including the operating system, middleware, runtime, applications, and data.
*   **Analogy:** Like renting raw computing power and building your own system on top.

#### 4.2 PaaS (Platform as a Service)

*   **What it Provides:** A complete development and operating environment as a service, including network infrastructure, servers, OS, middleware, and runtime.
*   **User Responsibility:** Users manage their applications and data. The provider handles all underlying infrastructure and platform components.
*   **Example:** A developer can use a PaaS service that provides MySQL and Apache Tomcat to quickly set up an environment for a Java web application.
*   **Analogy:** Like renting a fully equipped workshop where you just bring your tools and materials to build your product.

#### 4.3 SaaS (Software as a Service)

*   **What it Provides:** Fully functional software applications delivered over the Internet.
*   **Access:** Typically accessed via a web browser, without needing to install software locally.
*   **User Responsibility:** Users simply use the software's functions; they don't manage any underlying infrastructure, platform, or even the application itself.
*   **Examples:** Google Docs, SalesForce.com.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Web Browser Access:** No local software installation required.
    *   **Usage-Based Cost:** Fees often based on software usage.
    *   **On-Demand:** Software is immediately available when needed.
    *   **IT Optimization:** No user concerns about IT infrastructure management or scalability.
*   **Analogy:** Like using a taxi service – you just get in and go, without owning, maintaining, or even driving the car.

#### 4.4 Management Scope Comparison (User vs. Provider)

This illustrates who is responsible for managing each layer of the technology stack:

| Layer                 | On-Premises (Internal Infra) | IaaS (User Manages)  | PaaS (User Manages)  | SaaS (User Manages)  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Data**              | User                         | User                 | User                 | User                 |
| **Application**       | User                         | User                 | User                 | Provider             |
| **Runtime**           | User                         | User                 | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Middleware**        | User                         | User                 | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Operating System**  | User                         | User                 | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Virtualization**    | User                         | Provider             | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Servers**           | User                         | Provider             | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Storage**           | User                         | Provider             | Provider             | Provider             |
| **Network**           | User                         | Provider             | Provider             | Provider             |

### 5. Cloud Computing Operation Forms

Cloud services are also classified by how they are deployed and accessed:

*   **Public Cloud:**
    *   Services disclosed and accessible to the general public over the Internet.
    *   Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
*   **Private Cloud:**
    *   Cloud services implemented over a closed network, accessible only by authorized users within a specific enterprise or institution.
    *   Offers greater control and security.
*   **Hybrid Cloud:**
    *   A combination of public and private cloud services.
    *   Allows organizations to use the public cloud for non-sensitive data and scaling, while keeping sensitive data and core operations in a private cloud.
    *   **Crucial:** Compatibility and the ability to seamlessly move services between public and private domains.

### 6. Server Virtualization Technology

#### 6.1 Definition & Purpose

*   **Conventional Computing:** One operating system installed directly on one physical hardware, running applications.
*   **Virtualization:** A technology that abstracts computer resources:
    *   Makes multiple physical computers appear as a single server.
    *   Makes a single physical computer appear as multiple virtual computers.
*   **Purpose:** Allows running one or more operating systems on a single physical computer, maximizing resource utilization and management efficiency.
*   **Role in Cloud:** Cloud services heavily rely on virtualization to provide abstract computing resources to users, overcoming physical limitations (especially x86 virtualization).

#### 6.2 Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM)

*   **Definition:** The core technology for server virtualization; a logical platform that virtualizes a physical server.
*   **Host OS:** The physical server on which the hypervisor runs.
*   **Guest OS:** The virtualized operating systems running on the hypervisor.

#### 6.3 Hypervisor Types (by Installation Method)

*   **Native Type (Type 1 Hypervisor):**
    *   **Installation:** Installs the VMM directly onto the physical hardware, without needing an underlying host OS.
    *   **Advantages:** More efficient, saves resources as there's no host OS overhead.
    *   **Examples:** Xen, XenServer (Citrix), ESXServer (VMware), Power Hypervisor (IBM), Hyper-V (Microsoft), KVM.
*   **Hosted Type (Type 2 Hypervisor):**
    *   **Installation:** Installed as software *on top of an existing operating system*.
    *   **Examples:** VirtualPC (Microsoft), Workstation (VMware), VirtualBox (Oracle).

#### 6.4 Server Virtualization Methods (by Virtualization Technique)

Server virtualization can also be classified by the virtualization technique used:
*   Full Virtualization
*   Para-virtualization
*   OS-level Virtualization

Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Preview  for practical  business
Gartner, which annually publishes strategic  technologies  for the year, began including  virtualization  in
“Gartner's  Top Ten Strategic  Technologies’  in 2006 and added cloud computing  in 2009. AWS started its
service in 2006, achieved  annual sales of 5 trillion won in 2014, and generated  tremendous  sales growth
every year. Now, cloud services  are becoming  a necessity, not an option. Most of the technologies,  such as
Al, big data, and blockchain,  which have recently  become  the subject  of conversation,  operate  based on
cloud services  that basically  provide scalability  and speed. It is why most cloud service providers  provide
platforms  for new technologies.  The server virtualization  is changing.  In the past, server virtualization
was performed  using a hypervisor.  In recent  years, container-type  virtualization  has emerged.  It is quickly
establishing  a position  in the cloud service market because  it is lighter and faster than the existing
methods.  Typical  container  technologies  include Linux Containers  (LxC), Docker,  Kubernetes,  and Openshift.
01 Definition  of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing  was developed  to efficiently  utilize the surplus computer  capacity  of each server  and to flexibly
respond  to the demand  of uncertain  services  at enterprises.  While users had to own and manage  resources  in order
to use computer  resources  before the advent of cloud computing,  cloud computing  allows them to use computing
resources,  provided  through  the Internet,  in a virtualized  form when they need them.
The key to cloud computing  is that computer  resources  are available  through  the network  and are provided  in an
invisible  state so that users can work anywhere  using the computer  resources  they need, even without  knowing  the
complex  interior.  Around 2008, various  services  that utilize computing  resources  on the Internet  were launched,  and
“cloud computing”  began to be used as a comprehensive  term. Users could access  desired  services  from the Internet
without  requiring  expertise  in the technology  infrastructure  they support.
The following  benefits  are expected  from cloud services.
* Costs: CAPEX® reduction,  OPEX’ increase,  and TCO® reduction
+ Period: Reduced  development  time and product  development  cycle
* Operation:  Reduced  operating  personnel  and strengthened  resource  efficiency
+ Product:  Improved  product  integration
Although  the terms “cloud service”  and “cloud computing”  are generally  used interchangeably,  the Korea
6 CAPEX (Capital  expenditure):  Expenditures  spent to generate  future profits
7 OPEX: Operating  expenditure
8 TCO (Total Cost of Ownership):  Total cost of owning  a system,  including  the initial investment  and maintenance  costs
