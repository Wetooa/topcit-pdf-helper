# IT Business & Ethics: Learning Guide

## I. IT Business Integration & Alignment

### A. Concept of IT Business
*   IT is more than a tool or support function; it's a concept deeply interdependent with business strategy and objectives.
*   This interdependence:
    *   Strengthens a company's business model competitiveness.
    *   Creates new business value.

### B. Business and IT Alignment
1.  **Interdependence:**
    *   Corporate business (strategy, data management, processes) and IT systems (applications, infrastructure, network) are mutually dependent.
    *   **Alignment:** IT application programs, infrastructure, and organization support and realize a company's business strategy and processes.
2.  **Strategic Alignment Model (2-Dimensional Diagram):**
    *   **Strategic Fit:** Focuses on external (business environment) and internal (management structure) aspects.
    *   **Functional Integration:** Focuses on business and IT integration.
    *   *Visualized as: Business Strategy ↔ IT Strategy & Strategic Compatibility ↔ Functional Integration.*
3.  **Four Complementary Areas for Strategic Alignment:**
    *   Business Strategy
    *   IT Strategy
    *   Organizational Infrastructure and Processes
    *   IT Infrastructure and Processes
    *   *Each area has its own scope, capabilities, governance, infrastructure, processes, and technology.*

## II. IT Business Ecosystem

### A. The Hype Cycle (Gartner)
*   **Definition:** A diagram showing the evolution of expected industrial economic value and impact of new IT technologies over time. Released annually by Gartner.
*   **Purpose:** Helps understand current and future technological trends to aid company growth and IT business incorporation.
*   **Five Phases:**
    1.  **Innovation Trigger:** New technologies are first introduced, generating high expectations.
    2.  **Peak of Inflated Expectations:** Hype exceeds actual capabilities, leading to unrealistic expectations.
    3.  **Trough of Disillusionment:** The "bubble bursts" as technologies fail to meet overblown expectations.
    4.  **Slope of Enlightenment:** Expectations stabilize and start climbing steadily again as the technology improves and real-world applications emerge.
    5.  **Plateau of Productivity:** The technology matures, generates steady value, and becomes widely adopted.

### B. Evolution of the IT Ecosystem
*   IT technology advances create a vast ecosystem of interacting and competing technologies.
1.  **Key Revolutions:**
    *   **Information Revolution (1980s):** Driven by personal computers and telecom networks.
    *   **Smart Revolution (2000s onwards):** Mobile devices, smartphone-based wireless internet, phone, and computing services converged, accelerating IT industry convergence and "smartification" across industries (e.g., education, automobiles, medicine).
2.  **Hyper-Connected Society:**
    *   Driven by advancements in sensor and network technologies.
    *   Evolution: **M2M** (Machine-to-Machine) → **IoT** (Internet of Things) → **IoE** (Internet of Everything).
    *   Connects humans to humans, humans to objects, and objects to objects, linking humans, objects, spaces, data, and services.
3.  **Core Technologies for Hyper-Connected Society:**
    *   **ICBM:**
        *   **I**oT (Internet of Things)
        *   **C**loud Computing
        *   **B**ig Data
        *   **M**obile
4.  **IT Ecosystem Components (C-P-N-D-S):**
    *   The IT ecosystem's center is shifting from hardware devices to platforms and contents, increasing software importance.
    *   **C - Contents:**
        *   Increased consumption of mobile content due to mobile technology (e.g., music, video, e-books).
        *   Smartphone-centered mobile environment allows diverse content use anywhere, anytime.
        *   New content distribution ecosystems are emerging, focused on mobile users.
    *   **P - Platform:**
        *   Evolution from individual services by single operators to common platforms with multiple providers.
        *   Shift from closed platforms to open platforms.
        *   Trend towards using shared common platforms rather than building proprietary ones (e.g., Apple, Google, Kakao service frameworks).
    *   **N - Network:**
        *   Smart revolution (smartphones, tablets, smart TVs) significantly increased network traffic.
        *   Next-generation smart services (smart homes, smart cars) and numerous IoT devices generate massive amounts of data traffic.
    *   **D - Device:**
        *   Wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches like Samsung Galaxy Gear, smart glasses like Google Glass) have intensified competition and collaboration among device makers.
        *   The number of smartphones and tablet PCs connectable to smart devices is increasing.
    *   **S - Security:** (Mentioned as a component, but specific characteristics are not detailed in the provided text.)
    *   *Note: Destructive innovations like 3D printing and unmanned vehicles lead the IT ecosystem and improve competitiveness through open innovation and customized business models.*

### C. Major IT Paradigm Changes (Five Trends)
1.  **Change from HW to SW Platform:**
    *   IT ecosystem shifts from devices (Hardware) to platforms and contents (Software).
    *   Software and platforms are now key drivers for value creation and national industry growth.
2.  **Change from IT Convergence to Smart Convergence:**
    *   Smart mobile-based IT convergence expands into traditional major industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).
    *   Fintech (Finance + Technology) has emerged as a significant new growth area.
3.  **ICBM-based Hyper-Connected Society:**
    *   The foundation of the hyper-connected society is ICBM (IoT, Cloud, Big Data, Mobile).
    *   This paradigm creates increased opportunities for economic growth.
4.  **Rapid Changes in the IT Technology Environment:**
    *   Emergence of "real sensation environment" technologies like virtual reality (VR), blending real and virtual worlds.
    *   Rise of "destructive innovations" such as 3D printing and unmanned vehicles, which can disrupt existing markets.
5.  **IT Business Transformation of Competition:**
    *   Growth is increasingly driven by small and medium-sized creative IT venture companies.
    *   Competitiveness is built through open innovation and the spread of demand-customized business models.

B) The alignment  of business  and IT
In terms of IT business,  IT is more than just a tool or a support  function:  It is becoming  established  as a concept
whose interdependence  with business  strategy  objectives  and processes  is maximized.  This maximization  of
interdependence  not only strengthens  the competitiveness  of a company's  business model but also plays a major
role in creating  new business  value. [Figure 3] shows the interdependence  between  a coprorate  business  and the IT
system  of a corporation.

In IT business,  the alignment  of business  and IT can be understood  as IT application programs,  IT infrastructure,  and
an IT organization  that supports  and realizes  a company’sbusiness  strategy  and business  processes.The  strategic
alignment  model of business  and IT can be represented  as a 2-dimensional  diagram,  as shown in [Fig. 4]. In this figure,
the*strategic  fit” dimension  is subdivided  into external  focus (business  environment)  and internal  focus (management
structure),  while the“functional  integration’  dimension  is subdivided  into business  and IT.

To achieve strategic  alignment,  this model defines four areas that complement  each other: business  strategy,  IT
strategy,  organizational  infrastructure  and processes,  IT infrastructure,  and processes.  Each area has its own scope,
capabilities,  governance,  infrastructure,  processes,  and technology.
02 IT Business  Ecosystem
A) IT business  and the hype cycle
Now let's take a look at the changes  in the IT technology  environment  that have brought  about various  IT business
innovations  in recent  times. A diagram  that shows changes  in the expected  level of industrial  economic  value and the
impact  of new technologies  in the IT sector  over time is what the hype cycle from Gartner  (released  every year) is all
about.
In the hype cycle, the so-called  “innovation  trigger’  is the time when new technologies  are first introduced  and
people expect  great things from them. After that point, the level of expectation  gradually  increases  before the
new technology  starts to become  more exaggerated  than what it can actually  deliver, leading  to a period when the
bubble reaches its maximum  size (the peak of inflated expectations).  The Trough of Disillusionment  is the period
when the bubble bursts, after which the hype cycle enters a period of revival (the Slope of Enlightenment)  in which
the expectations  for the technology  start to climb steadily  once again. In the last period of the hype cycle, the
technology  transitions  to the Plateau  of Productivity,  the period when it generates  steady  values.

The hype cycle allows us to understand  not only those technologies  which have recently  become  important  issues,
but also what kind of world will unfold in the future due to the nature of such technologies.  Understanding  the
evolution  of technology  as presented  in the hype cycle and incorporating  it into an IT business  can be of tremendous
help to a company's  growth.
B) IT ecosystem
As IT technology  continues  to advance  and improve, it is creating  a huge ecosystem  where different  technologies
