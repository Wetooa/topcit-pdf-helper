# Learning Guide: Overview of System Architecture (Module 03)

## I. Introduction & Importance

*   **What is System Architecture?** The fundamental structure that defines how a system provides services, built upon its hardware and software components.
*   **Why it's Crucial Now:**
    *   Modern systems are increasingly complex.
    *   Driven by new technologies: Big Data, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT).
    *   Systems need to deliver high-performance computing, high-capacity memory, and high-speed communication.
    *   Essential for successful system implementation and operation.

## II. Learning Objectives

After studying this guide, you should be able to:
1.  Understand the concept and components of system architecture.
2.  Understand the overall system concept and its layers.
3.  Explain the different types of information systems.

## III. Key Terms

*   System Architecture
*   System Layer
*   Information System

## IV. Understanding System Architecture

### A. Core Concepts

*   **Information System (IS):** A system that uses Information Technology (IT) to provide services, typically via a computer.
*   **Computer System:** Operates as a combination of **hardware** (physical components) and **software** (programs and data).
*   **Implementing an IS:** Requires designing and constructing the IT infrastructure, including both hardware and software.
    *   **Software Architecture:** Defines software components, their operations, connections, and constraints.
    *   **Hardware Architecture:** Designs and develops the physical hardware infrastructure.

### B. Definitions of System Architecture

*   **Core Definition:** The architecture a system uses to provide services, based on its hardware and software architectures.
*   **Broader Definition:** Encompasses all architecture needed to build an information system, including:
    *   **Application Architecture (AA):** Structure of applications and their interactions.
    *   **Data Architecture (DA):** How data is stored, organized, and managed.
    *   **Technical Architecture (TA):** The underlying technology infrastructure.
*   **Narrower Definition:** A document detailing the configuration and relationships of:
    *   **Hardware:** Servers, storage, network, security devices.
    *   **Specific Software:** Operating Systems (OS), middleware (software that connects other software applications).
*   **INCOSE Definition (International Council on Systems Engineering):** "The fundamental and unifying system structure defined in terms of system elements, interfaces, processes, constraints, and behaviors."

## V. Practical Implications

*   **Hardware Security Matters:** Small hardware components (like a microchip) can be critically important and even be a source of sophisticated hacking. Hardware hacking can be more dangerous than software hacking.
*   **Complexity & Miniaturization:** Modern devices (e.g., smartphones) pack immense computing power into tiny spaces. Understanding their system architecture is essential to manage this complexity, ensure functionality, and maintain security.

>p> Recent  trends and issues
The system architecture  is becoming  more complex  as new technologies,  such as big data, cloud
computing,  and loT, have gained attention.  While the system  architecture  consisted  of a simple combination
of servers, storage,  and network  in the past, its configuration  is changing  to meet the requirements  of
the new technologies  to provide high-performance  computing  power, high-capacity  memory,  and high-
speed communication.  In line with these changes, the  system architecture is becoming  more important.
The system  architecture  is an essential  concept  in a practical  environment  for system  implementation  and
operation.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to understand  the concept  of the system  architecture  and explain its components.
2 .To be able to understand  and explain the system  concept  and system layers.
3. To be able to explain the types of information  systems.
>> Keywords
System  architecture,  System  layer, Information  system

"Discovery  of a ‘Chinese  hacking  chip’ in a well-known  server  board in the United
States...Industry  thrown  into commotion”  2018. 10. 05.
Citing the words of six senior US intelligence  officials on the 4th (local time), Bloomberg  reported  that a
hacking  microchip,  that was not in the design, was found on the server mainboard  of a well-known  server
manufacturer,  Super micro, and that the Chinese  Government  was allegedly  involved.

There is not a moment  in our daily lives when we do not use the services  provided  by computer  systems.
With the wide-spread  use of smartphones,  we are spending  even more time with computer  systems.  In
such an environment,  Chinese  hacking  chips can expose  our lives to hackers.  This hacking  chip was found on a
computer  system’s  board. It contains  stolen key US information  through  hardware  hacking,  which is more
threatening  than software  hacking.  This tiny chip has the capability  to steal information  from a computer
over a network. How can such a small chip contain this function?  While the early computer,  ENIAC, was
the size of a building,  computers  have become  drastically  smaller since then, and the computing  power
of smartphones  that we carry in our hand is so high, that it is not even comparable  to that of ENIAC. It is
necessary  to learn the system  architecture  to understand  the concept  of a computer  system.

01 Concept  of System  Architecture
A) Understanding  system  architecture
@ Overview  of system  architecture
An information  system is a system that uses information  technology  (IT). The information  system provides  services
using a computer,  and a computer  operates  with a combination  of hardware  and software.  Implementing  an
information  system used inside an enterprise,  or provided  as a service  to users, requires  the design and construction
of IT infrastructures,  such as hardware  and software  design and development.  Software  designs the software
components  and operations,  such as the connection  of the software  components  and constraints  based on software
architecture.  Hardware,  like software,  designs  and develops  the hardware  architecture.  System architecture  refers
to the architecture  for a system to provide services,  based on hardware  and software  architecture.  In a broader
definition,  it refers to all architecture,  including  the application  architecture  (AA), data architecture  (DA), and technical
architecture  (TA), for constructing  an information  system.  A narrow definition  refers to the document  that defines  the
configuration  and relationship  of hardware,  such as a server, storage,  network  and security,  and certain  software  parts,
such as OS and middleware.
@ Definition  of system  architecture
* Definition  as defined  by the International  Council  on Systems  Engineering  (INCOSE)

constraints,  and behaviors.
