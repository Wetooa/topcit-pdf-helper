## Learning Guide: System Architecture Essentials

### 1. File System Allocation Methods

File systems decide how to store and quickly access files on disk. Common methods include:

#### A. Contiguous Allocation
*   **Concept:** Files are stored in a continuous block of addresses on the physical disk.
*   **Advantage:** Fast reading speed (data is physically together).
*   **Disadvantage:** **External Fragmentation** – disk space becomes fragmented, making it hard to find large contiguous blocks for new files, even if total free space exists.

#### B. Linked Allocation
*   **Concept:** Files are stored in block units, with each block containing a pointer to the next block in the file. The directory stores pointers to the first and last blocks.
*   **Advantage:** Solves external fragmentation (blocks don't need to be contiguous).
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Slow reading speed (blocks are scattered, requiring jumps).
    *   Requires extra space to store pointers within blocks.
    *   Risk of data loss/corruption if a pointer is lost or damaged.
    *   Does not support direct access (must traverse the chain).

#### C. Indexed Allocation
*   **Concept:** Addresses the limitations of linked allocation by storing all file block pointers in a central **index block**. The directory points to this index block.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   No external fragmentation.
    *   Supports **direct access** (can directly jump to any block via the index).
*   **Disadvantage:** Greater storage space waste compared to linked allocation (due to dedicated index blocks).

### 2. Operating System File Systems

Different operating systems use various file systems to manage data storage:

*   **UNIX:** Characterized by components like **Boot block, Super block, Bitmap block, i-node, and Data block**. (Note: These are components within a UNIX-like file system structure rather than specific file system *names* like ext4).
*   **Linux:** ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, ZFS, ReiserFS, XFS
*   **Solaris:** ZFS, UFS
*   **Mac OS:** HFS, HFS+
*   **Windows:** FAT, NTFS

### 3. UNIX i-node System

In UNIX-like systems, the **i-node** (index-node) plays a crucial role in managing file and directory data.

*   **Role:** Handles allocation, application, creation, linking, and deletion of file/directory data.
*   **inode:**
    *   Contains all metadata about a file or directory (owner, access permissions, file size, links, type).
    *   Does **not** contain the file's data itself.
*   **inode table (i-list):** A file system table that stores all the inodes for files and directories.
*   **i-number:** A unique entry number that identifies an inode within the inode table.
*   **Addressing (Block Location Management):** Inodes manage block locations using 13 fields to point to data blocks:
    *   **10 Direct data blocks (0-9):** Directly point to the first few data blocks (e.g., up to 96KB data).
    *   **1 Single indirect data block (10):** Points to a block that contains pointers to other data blocks (e.g., up to 16MB data).
    *   **1 Double indirect data block (11):** Points to a block that contains pointers to single indirect blocks (e.g., up to 32GB data).
    *   **1 Triple indirect data block (12):** Points to a block that contains pointers to double indirect blocks (e.g., up to 70TB data).
    This hierarchical structure allows for very large files.

### 4. Input/Output (I/O) System

The I/O system facilitates communication between the computer and external devices.

*   **Components:**
    1.  **Input/Output Device:** The physical hardware (e.g., keyboard, printer, disk drive) that handles data transfer.
    2.  **Input/Output Module (Controller):** An electronic component that interfaces the I/O device with the processor.
*   **I/O Module Functions:**
    *   Controls the I/O device.
    *   Coordinates timing.
    *   Communicates with the processor.
    *   Communicates with the I/O devices.
    *   Performs **data buffering** (temporary storage of data during transfer).
    *   Detects errors.
*   **Purpose:** Allows the main processor to easily control multiple I/O devices without direct management of each device's specific intricacies.

### 5. Computer Architecture: Recent Trends & Concepts

**Computer architecture** is the conceptual design and operational structure that forms the basis of computer systems. It's a blueprint describing the design, portability, and requirements (like speed and interconnection) of a computer's various parts. It primarily focuses on how the **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** performs and accesses memory addresses.

*   **Foundation:** Modern computer structures are largely based on the **Von Neumann architecture**, where instructions and data are stored in the same memory space. The basic instruction processing structure has remained largely consistent.
*   **Evolution:**
    *   **Parallel processing** and other technologies have significantly improved performance.
    *   New concepts are emerging, such as:
        *   **Neuromorphic chips:** Designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain for AI and machine learning.
        *   **Quantum computers:** Utilize quantum-mechanical phenomena (superposition, entanglement) to perform computations far beyond classical computers for specific problems.

+ Renaming  file: A file name must be changeable,  and a renamed  file should exist at a point within the directory
structure.
C) Allocation  by a file system
A file system should consider  which space on the disk to use and quickly access the files. An OS's file system
generally  uses the contiguous  allocation,  linked allocation,  or indexed  allocation.
* Contiguous  allocation:
This method  arranges  files as a set of contiguous  addresses  on the physical  disk, as shown in [Figure  27] below. The
disk addresses  of stored files are defined linearly. This method  has the advantage  of a relatively  high reading  speed,
since the files are stored in contiguous  addresses.  However,  it creates  an external  fragmentation  problem.

[Figure  27] Contiguous  Allocation
+ Linked allocation
This method stores files in block units and links each block to a list, as shown in [Figure 28] below. The directory
keeps pointers  to the first and last blocks of the files. As shown in the figure, the directory  contains  9 and 25, which
are the first and last block pointers,  respectively.  Block 9 is linked to blocks 16, 1, 9, 10, and 25 in that order. This
method can solve the external  fragmentation  problem of the contiguous  allocation  method. However,  the linked
allocation  method is slow to read and requires  the area to store the pointers  separately,  since data blocks are
scattered  on the physical  disk. Moreover,  it can cause data errors if the linked pointer  data is lost or corrupt.

+ Indexed  allocation
The linked allocation  cannot support  direct access and is difficult  to manage  the loss, since the block pointer
addresses  are scattered  throughout  the disk. The indexed allocation  solves the problem by managing  all
pointer  data of a file in an index block, as shown in [Figure 29]. The indexed allocation  does not create external
fragmentation  and supports  the direct addresses.  However,  the waste of storage  space is larger than the linked
allocation  method.
