## Learning Guide: Performance Evaluation Techniques

This guide covers financial performance evaluation, the Balanced Score Card (BSC) technique, IT-BSC, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and Management by Objectives (MBO).

---

### 1. Financial Performance Evaluation Techniques

These techniques assess investment feasibility and returns.

*   **Return on Investment (ROI)**
    *   **Definition:** Ratio of net financial effect to total cost.
    *   **Use:** Assesses investment feasibility.
    *   **Limitation:** Cannot estimate the time an investment needs to yield net income.

*   **Net Present Value (NPV)**
    *   **Definition:** Expresses the relationship between the cost and effect of a currency's present value, considering its discount rate.
    *   **Reflects:** Accurate future net profits and monetary value over time.
    *   **Note:** Risks associated with the payback period must be considered separately.

*   **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
    *   **Definition:** Revenues generated from investments against cash flows.
    *   **Expresses:** Expected annual revenues to judge risk reduction.
    *   **Limitation:** Does not consider investment size or payback period.

*   **Payback Period (PP)**
    *   **Definition:** The time it takes for cumulative effect to exceed cumulative cost and reach the break-even point.
    *   **Expresses:** Point of transition to surplus or visible success.
    *   **Shows:** *When* revenue is generated, but not *how much*.

### 2. Balanced Score Card (BSC) Technique

A performance management system that evaluates both financial and non-financial performance.

#### A) Overview of BSC

*   **What it is:** A balanced performance evaluation technique.
*   **Introduced by:** Robert Kaplan and David Norton in 1992.
*   **Why it's needed:** Traditional systems relied too heavily on financial indicators, making strategy execution difficult. BSC addresses this by incorporating non-financial evaluations.
*   **Purpose:** Balances indicators, concretizes and links strategies, and improves internal communication.

#### B) Characteristics of BSC

*   **Balance between indicators:**
    *   Approaches performance from multiple perspectives (not just financial).
    *   Balances short-term and long-term views.
    *   Balances leading (predictive) and trailing (result-oriented) indicators.
*   **Concreteness of strategy:**
    *   Secures strategy clarity through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    *   Aims for company-wide optimization, not just partial.
    *   Aligns strategies with correct business directions.
*   **Connectivity of strategy:**
    *   Establishes causal relationships between strategies.
    *   Links core strategies after focused selection.
*   **Internal communication tool:**
    *   Builds executive capability using detailed KPIs.
    *   Serves as a common language across the organization.

#### C) Component Elements of BSC

BSC evaluates performance from four perspectives and includes elements to manage and achieve enterprise goals.

*   **Perspective:** The four viewpoints from which performance is evaluated (Finance, Customer, Process, Learning & Growth).
*   **Critical Success Factor (CSF):** Factors essential for successfully realizing the enterprise's vision and strategy.
*   **Strategy Map:** A visual representation showing the causal relationships among CSFs, illustrating how an organization creates value.
*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** An indicator to measure and manage the level and success of a CSF.

#### D) Four Perspectives of BSC

These perspectives are organically interconnected, managing both financial and non-financial views.

1.  **Financial Perspective**
    *   **Focus:** Shareholder value, financial evaluation.
    *   **Key Items:** Revenue, net profits, cost reductions.
    *   **Key Indicators:** Cash flow, inventory, bonds, operating profit ratio.
    *   **Example:** Shareholder dividend income.

2.  **Customer Perspective**
    *   **Focus:** Customer satisfaction and loyalty.
    *   **Key Items:** Increase customer loyalty, enhancement of customer satisfaction.
    *   **Key Indicators:** Customer satisfaction, on-time supply rate.
    *   **Example:** Customer satisfaction and delivery time compliance.

3.  **Internal Process Perspective**
    *   **Focus:** Optimization of internal processes, efficiency.
    *   **Key Items:** Optimization of processes, removal of process bottlenecks.
    *   **Key Indicators:** Process cycle time, product unit cost.
    *   **Example:** Product quality and production efficiency improvements.

4.  **Learning and Growth Perspective**
    *   **Focus:** Employee development, innovation, organizational capacity.
    *   **Key Items:** Employee learning efforts, measurement of performance gains by enhancing skill levels.
    *   **Key Indicators:** Employee satisfaction, number of newly developed products.
    *   **Example:** New product development.

### 3. Balanced IT Performance Evaluation Technique (IT-BSC)

IT-BSC adapts the BSC concept to evaluate IT investment performance.

#### A) Overview of IT-BSC

*   **What it is:** A performance management tool to achieve enterprise goals by applying BSC concepts to IT investment evaluation.
*   **Why it's needed:** Traditional finance-based techniques struggle to quantify intangible IT investments. IT-BSC provides a systematic way to evaluate IT's growing importance.

#### B) Component Elements and BSC Link Structure

IT-BSC has four perspectives, linked to the enterprise's overall BSC, providing a balanced view for IT performance.

1.  **Business Value Perspective**
    *   **Measurement:** Create enterprise value from IT investments.
    *   **BSC Link:** Financial perspective.

2.  **User Perspective**
    *   **Measurement:** Maximize the value of IT service providers and users.
    *   **BSC Link:** Customer perspective.

3.  **Operational Process Perspective**
    *   **Measurement:** Ensure efficient delivery of IT products and services.
    *   **BSC Link:** Internal process perspective.

4.  **Future-Oriented Perspective**
    *   **Measurement:** Provide IT service and technology development support for continuous development.
    *   **BSC Link:** Learning and growth perspective.

### 4. Management of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs are quantifiable indicators derived from Critical Success Factors (CSFs) to measure goal achievement.

#### A) Overview of KPI

*   **What it is:** Key Performance Indicator (KPI) – a quantifiable indicator of an organization's Critical Success Factors (CSFs).
*   **Purpose:** Measures the achievement of goals.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Must accurately reflect organizational goals.
    *   Must be critical for realizing those goals.
    *   Can be "means" (drivers of victory) or "ends" (results of strategy).
    *   Influence employee behavior.
*   **Importance:** Widely used in performance evaluations.

#### B) KPI Establishment Procedure

KPIs should align with vision, act as strategic drivers, and provide guidance for the entire organization.

1.  **Definition of the KPI Area**
    *   **Activities:** Specify characteristics of the organization/operational unit, select participants.
    *   **Output:** KPI establishment plan, organizational chart.
2.  **Collect Data**
    *   **Activities:** Collect/review vital documents, develop interview questions, execute interview plan.
    *   **Output:** Interview questionnaire, KPI portfolio.
3.  **Analyze**
    *   **Activities:** Create activity descriptions, analyze affinity, develop topics.
    *   **Output:** Job-KPI affinity analysis chart.
4.  **Derive KPIs**
    *   **Activities:** Derive, refine, classify, and integrate KPIs.
    *   **Output:** KPI list, KPI derivation.
5.  **KPI Verification**
    *   **Activities:** Establish comparison criteria, develop a comparison matrix, compare associative relations, set targets.
    *   **Output:** KPI verification matrix.

#### C) Precautions When Deriving KPIs

1.  **Strategic Support of Top Management is Essential:** KPI management should be a top management responsibility to ensure KPIs reflect the organization's strategic vision. Avoid delegating solely to middle management.
2.  **Use Reference Models, but Don't Imitate:** KPIs must be unique to an enterprise's specific goals and strategies. A great company's KPIs may not suit another.
3.  **KPI Derivation is Continuous Improvement:** Start with a balanced set and evolve them gradually. KPIs must be modifiable to respond to changes in the business environment.

---

### 5. Goal Management System

#### A) Key Perspectives of MBO

*   **What it is:** Management by Objectives (MBO) – a system for managing organizational goals.
*   **Purpose:** A business management technique for setting goals and controlling/managing the path to meet those goals, ultimately improving individual performance and capabilities.

03 Balanced  Score Card Technique
A) Overview  of the BSC technique
The balanced  performance  evaluation  technique  is referred  to as BSC (Balanced  Score Card). BSC is a technique  for
managing  balanced  performance  by evaluating  not only financial  performances  but also non-financial  performances.
It was introduced  to the world by Harvard  Business  School Professor  Robert Kaplan and consultant  David Norton in
1992 in the Harvard  Business  Review.
+ The traditional  performance  management  system is so restricted  to financial  indicators  that enterprises  experience
difficulties  in executing  their strategies  in a systematic  manner. This has raised the need to consider  non-financial
evaluations.
+ BSC is utilized as a tool for maintaining  a balance  between  indicators,  for the concretization  and linking of strategies,
and for communication  within the organization.
