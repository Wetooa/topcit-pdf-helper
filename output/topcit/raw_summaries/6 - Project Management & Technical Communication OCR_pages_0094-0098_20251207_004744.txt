# Project Schedule Management: Learning Guide

This guide covers the essential concepts and processes of project schedule management.

## 1. Introduction to Project Schedule Management

*   **Goal:** To complete a project within the time agreed with the client.
*   **Approach:**
    *   If the finish date is pre-determined: Planning is "top-down," where activities are adjusted to fit the timeline.
    *   **Key Principle:** Project schedules must be **feasible**, considering the project scale and available resources. Avoid neglecting activity relationships or arbitrary stage weighting, which can lead to problems.

## 2. The Schedule Management Process

This process involves several interconnected steps:

1.  **Schedule Management Planning**
2.  **Activity Definition**
3.  **Activity Sequencing**
4.  **Activity Duration Estimation**
5.  **Schedule Development**
6.  **Schedule Control**

*(Note: In PMBOK 6th edition, "Activity Resource Estimation" is now part of Resource Management.)*

### 2.1. Schedule Management Planning

*   **Action:** Formulate a **Project Schedule Management Plan**.
*   **Detailing:** Share the project management plan, approval details, and rules for measuring the schedule with the team.
*   **Control:** This plan is crucial for quality control. Any changes to the confirmed schedule require approval from the project steering committee and the plan must be updated.

### 2.2. Activity Definition

*   **Action:** Identify and document all activities necessary to produce project deliverables.
*   **Basis:** Project scope and requirements.
*   **Method:** Since it's hard to define everything upfront, activities are refined incrementally using:
    *   **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposing project work into smaller, manageable components.
    *   **Rolling Wave Planning:** Detailing activities only as they become clearer and closer in the project lifecycle.

### 2.3. Activity Sequencing

*   **Action:** Identify relationships between defined activities and connect them in a logical order.
*   **Logical Relationship Types:**
    *   **Finish-to-Start (FS):** A successor activity cannot start until its predecessor activity has finished.
        *   *(Most common.)* Example: Develop product **after** screen design finishes.
    *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** A successor activity cannot finish until its predecessor activity has finished.
        *   Example: Analysis **completes only when** writing and deleting text are completed.
    *   **Start-to-Start (SS):** A successor activity cannot start until its predecessor activity has started.
        *   Example: Development activities **can start only when** planning begins.
    *   **Start-to-Finish (SF):** A successor activity cannot finish until its predecessor activity has started.
        *   Example: In a 3-shift system, a worker (successor) can leave **only when** the next worker (predecessor) arrives.

### 2.4. Activity Duration Estimation

*   **Action:** Estimate the time required to perform each activity with allocated resources.
*   **Estimation Methods:**
    *   **Expert Judgment:** Rely on internal or external experts with similar project experience.
    *   **Analogous Estimating:** Use data from similar past projects to estimate the current one. *(A risk-based technique.)*
    *   **Three-point Estimating:** Estimates duration using three values, especially useful when experience is limited or risks are high.
        *   **Optimistic (O):** Best-case scenario, shortest duration.
        *   **Most Likely (M):** Realistic or average duration.
        *   **Pessimistic (P):** Worst-case scenario, longest duration.
        *   **Formula (Beta Average):** `(O + 4M + P) / 6`
        *   **Origin:** Derived from **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**, a technique developed in 1958 for complex projects, which helps predict schedules considering risks and fluctuations.

### 2.5. Schedule Development

*   **Action:** Create the overall project schedule.
*   **Process:** Combine the sequenced activities, their estimated durations, resource requirements, and any schedule constraints. A common tool for visualization is a **Gantt Chart**.

### 2.6. Schedule Control

*   **Action:** Monitor the status of project activities and manage changes to ensure the schedule stays on track.
*   **Key Focus Areas (General):**
    *   Determine the current status of the schedule.
    *   Adjust factors causing schedule changes.
    *   Identify if the schedule has actually changed.
    *   Manage approved changes.
*   **Key Focus Areas (Agile Methodology):**
    *   Compare work completed against estimated work in a given time period.
    *   Perform **retrospective reviews** to learn from the process and make improvements.
    *   **Reprioritize remaining tasks (backlog).**
    *   Determine **velocity** (the rate at which deliverables are produced, verified, and accepted per iteration, e.g., every two weeks or month).
    *   Manage actual changes.

## 3. Schedule Management Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)

### 3.1. What is CPM?

*   **Definition:** A network analysis technique used to determine the **minimum duration** required to complete a project.
*   **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that determines the project's overall minimum duration. These activities have **"Zero" float**, meaning any delay to them will delay the entire project.
*   **Inputs:** Project Schedule Network Diagram, activity sequences, durations, dependencies, leads, and delays.
*   **Analysis:** Involves **Forward Pass** and **Backward Pass** calculations.

### 3.2. Key Components of CPM

*   **Forward Pass:** Calculates the earliest possible dates for activities.
    *   **Early Start (ES):** The earliest date an activity can possibly begin.
    *   **Early Finish (EF):** The earliest date an activity can possibly finish.
*   **Backward Pass:** Calculates the latest possible dates for activities without delaying the project.
    *   **Late Start (LS):** The latest date an activity can start without delaying the project's finish.
    *   **Late Finish (LF):** The latest date an activity can finish without delaying the project's finish.
*   **Total Float (Slack):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed or extended without delaying the project's overall finish date.
    *   **Formula:** `Total Float = Late Finish (LF) - Early Finish (EF)`
    *   **Formula:** `Total Float = Late Start (LS) - Early Start (ES)`

### 3.3. CPM Example Setup (Conceptual)

To calculate a schedule using CPM:

1.  List all project activities, their durations, and their predecessor activities.
2.  Draw a network diagram, visually linking activities based on their sequential relationships.
3.  Place the activity name and its duration on the diagram.
    *   For example, if Activity B has a predecessor Activity A, B is placed after A, with its duration noted.
4.  Once the diagram is complete, perform Forward and Backward Pass calculations to identify ES, EF, LS, LF, and Total Float for each activity, ultimately revealing the critical path.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
the relationship  between  each activity  to develop  a schedule,  with the goal of completing  the project within
the time agreed  with the client.
If the finish date has already  been specified,  the schedule  management  process  is ignored,  and the schedule  is
planned  in a top-down  manner,  the activities  to be performed  will be determined  based on the project  timeline.
The schedule  may get tight as the correlation  between  each activity is neglected  and it is divided by weighting
each stage of the project, which can eventually  fall into a vicious  cycle. Project  schedule  should be feasible  and
planned  in consideration  of scale and resource  capacity.
B) Schedule  management  process
The schedule  management  process  includes  project  schedule  management  planning,  activity  definition,  activi-
ty sequencing,  activity  duration  estimation,  schedule  development,  and schedule  control.  The existing  activity
resource  estimation  process  has been moved to the knowledge  area of resource  management  in the PMBOK
6th edition.
@® Schedule  Management  Planning
For schedule  management  planning,  a project schedule  management  plan is formulated.  A detailed plan is
made by sharing  the project management  plan, project approval,  and rules for measuring  the project  schedule
with the team members.
In addition,  as the project schedule  management  plan is an important  deliverable  for quality control or
supervision,  any change in the confirmed schedule  requires an approval  from the project steering  committee
and the plan must be updated  and kept in a record.
@ Definition  of Activity
It is a process  of identifying  and documenting  the relevant  activities  to be performed  to produce  the project
deliverables.  The project  teams define the activities  based on the project scope and requirements  statement.
Since it is difficult  to define all activities  at the beginning  of the project,  the project  activities  are elaborated  in
a repetitive  and incremental  manner  through  division and Rolling Wave Planning  based on the work breakdown
system  (WBS).
@® Sequencing  of Activity
It is a process of identifying  the relationship  between  subdivided  activities  and connecting  them in a logical
order.
The logical relationship  between  activities  is divided into the following  types:
<Table 40> Logical Relationship  between  Activities
Item Content Case

Relationship Predecessor  Activity  has started
@ Estimation  of Activity  Duration
Activity  duration  estimation  is a process  of estimating  the time it will take to perform each activity  with the
allocated  resources.  The estimation  method is as follows:
<Table 41> Characteristics  of Activity  Duration  Estimation  Methods
Estimation  Method Characteristics  and Explanation
+ Amethod  that a resource  estimation  expert  uses internal or external  resources  with similarExpert  Judgmentexperience  to calculate  the resources  to be put into the activity.
Analogous  Estimating + Amethod  of estimation  by referring  to similar  projects  performed  in the past
+ Risk-based  estimation  technique
Three-point  Estimating + Estimate  the beta average  of Optimistic  value, Most Likely value, Pessimistic  value
+ Commonly  used in case of lack of experience
Expert Judgment  and Analogous Estimating  are common  methods  used by practitioners  and those with
extensive  experience  in the field. Three-point  Estimating  is a method  of measuring  the optimistic,  pessimistic,
and most likely values for each activity  in consideration  of risks, which allows more accurate  estimation.  The
term “Three-point”  has the following  meanings:
+ Optimistic,  O: the best-case  estimate,  the shortest  duration
+ Most likely, M: the most likely estimate,  the average  duration
+ Pessimistic,  P: the worst-case  estimate,  the longest  duration
In the three-point  estimation  method,  the most likely estimate  receives  a multiplier of 4 to come up with the
final estimate  of an activity. If an activity  takes 4 days to be opti...
