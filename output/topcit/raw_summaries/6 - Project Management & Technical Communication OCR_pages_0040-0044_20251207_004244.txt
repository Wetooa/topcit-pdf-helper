@ Methods  of Writing  Meeting  Minutes
In other words, meeting  minutes  are documents  that clarify communication  by organizing  meeting  results. In
case of collaboration,  it is very important  to organize  meeting  minutes  because  the content  of communication
may be subtly changed  later due to differing  interests.  The specific  method  of writing  the minutes  is as follows.
Record  the date and time, place, theme of the meeting,  participants,  discussions,  and decisions.  If the meeting
lasts for a long time, you can use an electronic  recorder.
Minutes  are basically  written in accordance  with the 5W1H principle:  When, where, who, what, how, and why.
It is of utmost  importance  to record the summarized  opinions  presented  at the meeting.  As described  above,
minutes  serve  a role as the official letter that prevents  you from overturning  what was previously  agreed.
The completed  minutes  are circulated  via e-mail  to the attendees  of the meeting,  and opinions  are received  or
signed after public disclosure.  The minutes  of the meeting  must be confirmed  as it will become  an important
document  to record business  process  in the future. Nowadays,  meeting  minutes  are usually shared by e-mail,
so it is good to ask stakeholders  for opinions  after writing in the e-mail, "| have organized  the minutes  as
above, and please review them and offer us your opinion.”,  adding “If there is no special opinion, | will share
them or proceed  as they are.’

ESSENCE
D) Methods  of writing  e-mail
@® Importance  of E-mail
Email is one of the communication  techniques  that have been widely adopted  with the invention  of the Internet  and it
has become  the most popular  and frequently  used in recent  years. In particular,  in the field of software  development,  it is
a highly utilized means  of communication  and often serves as an official letter, so it must be written  clearly and carefully.
There are various techniques  for writing e-mails, but in general, the techniques  to refer to in business  settings  are as

subordinate  clause, deductive  writing)
@ Methods  of Writing  Effective  E-mail
+ Subject  line: Anyone  would be able to guess what the e-mail is about simply by reading  the subject  line. The
subject  of the email should be a itemized  sentence  that concisely  expresses  only the core of the email. It is

+ Heading:  Place important  information  at the beginning  so that you can understand  it quickly. The structure
of the email is divided into 4 parts: greeting,  headings,  numbered  details, and final thank-you  message.  The
headings  serve to help you quickly understand  the contents  of the entire mail. Therefore,  it is better to
organize  the contents  of the mail in one sentence  so that the recipient  can quickly  understand  the contents.
+ Numbering:  The key tip for writing an email is to add numbers  such as 1, 2, and 3 to the email content  so
that you can understand  the email content  faster. It is important  to always number  the content  of the email.
