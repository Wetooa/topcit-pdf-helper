### **Part 2: Presentation Fundamentals**

#### **2.1 Importance of Presentations**

Presentations are critical for:
*   Winning development projects.
*   Attracting investment for new products.
*   Securing internal organizational decisions.
*   Project termination decisions.
*   Often determine success or failure.

Alongside writing, strong presentation skills are vital for securing support and decisions for projects.

#### **2.2 Definition of Presentation**

A presentation is a process where a presenter aims to change an audience's consciousness or behavior by conveying facts, information, and opinions within a set time to achieve a specific goal.

#### **2.3 Purposes of Presentation**

| Purpose          | Key Objectives                                                                                                   |

| **To Inform**    | Deliver sufficient information through evidence and detailed descriptions. Share the speaker's perspective.      |
| **To Persuade**  | Influence the audience to understand the speaker's viewpoint or draw desired conclusions.                        |
| **To Provoke Action** | The final step, leading to specific actions like selection, ordering, adoption, or acceptance. |

### **Part 3: Presentation Design & Preparation Process**

This is a sequential process for creating and delivering effective presentations.

1.  **Goal/Topic Setting:**
    *   Define your presentation's goal or topic in a single, clear sentence.
    *   Unclear goals significantly increase the chance of failure.

2.  **3P Analysis:** Analyze the presentation context by considering:
    *   **P**erson (Audience): Their situation, time availability, interests.
    *   **P**urpose (Goal): The specific objective of your presentation.
    *   **P**lace (Environment): The location and setting of the presentation.

3.  **Content Composition/Design:**
    *   Determine the main theme to achieve your goal.
    *   Initially brainstorm ideas narratively, then trim and refine into a compelling message.

4.  **Data Collection/Analysis:**
    *   Gather and cite data that effectively supports your message.

5.  **Delivery Format:**
    *   Prepare your materials in a format best suited to deliver your message, based on your 3P analysis.

6.  **Rehearsal:**
    *   Practice your presentation with the prepared materials.
    *   Extensive practice helps reduce nervousness during the actual presentation.

7.  **Presentation (Delivery):**
    *   Deliver with confidence, conciseness, and clarity, applying practiced techniques.

8.  **Post-Processing (Q&A, Feedback):**
    *   Answer audience questions regarding your presented issues.
    *   Receive feedback to identify areas for improvement.
    *   Prepare for expected questions in advance to answer calmly.
    *   Listen carefully to questions and explain in a humble and clear manner.

### **Part 4: Presentation Scenario Creation**

A presentation scenario (or script) is crucial for a successful presentation.

#### **4.1 Importance of a Scenario**
*   It's the most important preparation step.
*   Helps novice presenters avoid tension and stay on track.

#### **4.2 Scenario Content Composition**
*   Derive key presentation points from your materials.
*   Order points suitable for the audience, purpose, and place, considering time limits.
*   Ensure the story's overall flow and keywords are clear and efficient.

#### **4.3 Scenario Length**
*   Roughly 3 minutes of presentation time per A4 sheet of script.
*   Structure the scenario to fit the allotted time, including time for Q&A.
*   **Crucially, avoid exceeding the scheduled time.**

---

### **Part 5: Writing Presentation Materials**

#### **5.1 Overall Material Composition**

Materials generally follow this structure: **Opening → Table of Contents → Main Text → Closing.**

*   **Opening:**
    *   Establishes the presenter's first impression; success or failure can be determined within the first 30 seconds.
    *   Crucial for building a positive impression and trust.
*   **Table of Contents:**
    *   Structure based on briefing length and content complexity.
    *   **Two-tiered structure:** For presentations under 30 minutes.
    *   **Three-tiered structure:** For presentations over one hour.
*   **Main Text:** Can be organized in different ways:
    *   **Requested Order Type:**
        *   **Strength:** Easy to write, includes all requested content.
        *   **Weakness:** May contain too much, potentially obscuring the key message.
    *   **Key Issue Type:**
        *   **Strength:** Logical structure, easily connects strategies and key issues.
        *   **Weakness:** May omit essential but non-core parts.
    *   **Presentation Evaluation Form Type:**
        *   **Strength:** Organized around the evaluator's interests (if a form exists).
        *   **Weakness:** Composition might feel unnatural.
*   **Closing:**
    *   Summarizes key content.
    *   Use feelings or quotes to leave a lasting impression.
    *   **Do not introduce new information or stories here.**

#### **5.2 Scenario Logic & Structure within Presentation Materials**

When writing your presentation scenario, consider:

*   **Logic Development (Key Message Placement):**
    *   **Key Message First (Conclusion-first):**
        *   **When:** Presenting solutions, or to high-ranking audiences.
        *   **Advantage:** Induces interest and retains attention quickly.
    *   **Key Message Last (Story Development):**
        *   **When:** Dramatic story development is needed, or for training.
        *   **Advantage:** Builds connection with the audience and ensures full understanding of the conclusion.
*   **Structure Table of Contents:**
    *   After deciding on your logic development, build a table of contents with first-level headings and then detailed subsections.
*   **Check the Logic Flow:**
    *   Simulate the presentation using your table of contents to identify any disruptions in the flow.
*   **Define Conclusion:**
    *   Summarize the presentation content and organize final arguments or suggestions.
    *   Ensure the conclusion relates naturally to the logic flow for the audience.

#### **5.3 General Material Creation Considerations**

*   **Storyboard:** Start by organizing the overall presentation storyboard, including flow and table of contents.
*   **Clear Conclusion:** Define your final conclusion clearly from the start.
*   **Visual Factors:** Consider visual elements alongside your story.

Presentations  have the most important  influence  on winning  development  projects,  attracting
investment  in new product  development,  securing  decision-making  within the organization,  and
project  termination.  In many cases, success  or failure depends  on the presentation.  Along with writing

01 Presentation  Design  and Preparation  Process
Presentation  is a series of processes  in which the presenter  induces  changes  in the audience's  consciousness
or behavior  in the direction  the presenter  desires  by conveying  and persuading  the audience  with certain facts,
information,  and opinions  within a set time period to achieve  the desired  goal.
A) Purpose  of presentation
<Table 23> Purpose  of Presentation
+ Basics of all communication
To inform + Sufficient  delivery  of information  through  presentation  of evidence  and detailed
description
+ Share the speaker's  perspective  with the audience
To persuade + The audience  does not always understand  the speaker's  point of view or draw
conclusions  like the speaker.
+ The final stage of the entire document  preparation,  including  briefing  sessionsTo provoke  action fae 4p + The “action” means selection, order, adoption,  and acceptance.
B) Presentation  process
@® Goal/topic  setting
Goals and topics should be defined  in one sentence  to make them clear. If the goal is unclear, the presentation
is more likely to fail.
@ 3P analysis
Person (audience),  Purpose  (purpose),  and Place (place/environment)  are called 3P. The presentation  needs to
be analyzed  by comprehensively  considering  the audience's  situation  (time, interest,  etc.), the purpose/goal  of
the presentation,  and the place and environment  of presentation.
@® Content  composition/design
It's the step in determining  the theme of what to tell to achieve the desired goal. It is important  to write
sentences  in a narrative  manner  like brainstorming,  and to make a compelling  message  by appropriately
trimming  it.
@ Data collection/analysis
Collect  and cite data that can effectively  support  the previously  constructed  message.
© Delivery  format
Prepare  data in a format  that can effectively  deliver a message  to the other party based on the items analyzed
by 3P analysis
© Rehearsal
It is a stage of rehearsal  practice based on the written data. It takes a lot of practice  to avoid being nervous  in
practice.
