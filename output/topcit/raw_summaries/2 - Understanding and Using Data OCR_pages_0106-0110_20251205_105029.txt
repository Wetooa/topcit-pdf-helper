## Database Languages: DDL, DCL, DML

This guide covers the essential relational database languages, their commands, and core concepts.

### 1. Types of Relational Database Languages

Relational database languages are classified based on their function:

*   **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines and manages the database structure (e.g., tables).
*   **DCL (Data Control Language):** Controls access to data and manages database integrity.
*   **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Manages the actual data within the database (search, insert, update, delete).

**TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Sometimes separated from DCL, it controls database transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

### 2. Evolution of SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) standards have evolved:

*   **SQL-86:** First SQL standard.
*   **SQL-92:** Major revision, focused on relational databases.
*   **SQL:1999 (SQL3):** Introduced object-oriented features, regular expressions, recursive queries, and triggers.
*   **SQL-2003:** Added XML features, window functions, and auto-generated column values.
*   **SQL-2006 (and beyond):** Continued enhancements for metadata access and other features.

**Characteristics of SQL3 (Object-Relational DBMS):**
*   **Relational:** New data types, conditional expressions, strengthened type system.
*   **Object-Oriented:** Supports user-defined types, objects, object identifiers, reference types, functions, and methods.
*   **Other:** Recursive queries, active database functions (triggers), client-server environment support, improved security, and view update functions.

### 3. Data Definition Language (DDL)

**Purpose:** To define and manage the database schema (structure) for the computer to understand. It handles the creation, alteration, and deletion of database objects like tables.

**Main DDL Statements:**

*   **CREATE:**
    *   **Function:** Defines and creates database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes, schemas, functions).
    *   **Usage:** Used to define primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) when creating tables. Object names must be unique.
*   **ALTER:**
    *   **Function:** Changes the structure of an existing database object.
    *   **Usage:** Add or delete columns, add or delete constraints in a table.
*   **DROP:**
    *   **Function:** Deletes an object (and all its data and structure) from the database.
    *   **Important:** If the table has referenced constraints, those must be deleted first. In Oracle, `CASCADE CONSTRAINT` option can delete related constraints simultaneously.
*   **RENAME:**
    *   **Function:** Changes the name of an object (e.g., a table).

### 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

**Purpose:** To define and manage data controls, ensuring secure and concurrent use of the database.

**Key Roles of DCL:**
*   **Data Security:** Protects data from unauthorized access.
*   **Integrity:** Maintains data accuracy.
*   **Recovery:** Helps the system cope with failures.
*   **Concurrency Control:** Allows multiple users to access the database simultaneously without conflict.

**Main DCL Statements:**

*   **GRANT:**
    *   **Function:** Grants specific privileges (permissions) on a database object to a user.
    *   **Example:** `GRANT SELECT ON customer TO ABC;` (Grants user ABC permission to view data in the 'customer' table).
*   **REVOKE:**
    *   **Function:** Removes (cancels) previously granted privileges from a user.
    *   **Example:** `REVOKE SELECT ON customer FROM ABC;` (Removes SELECT privilege from user ABC on the 'customer' table).
*   **DENY:**
    *   **Function:** Explicitly denies a privilege to a user.
    *   **Important:** If a user is both granted and denied a privilege, `DENY` takes precedence.
    *   **Example:** `DENY SELECT ON customer TO ABC;` (Explicitly denies SELECT privilege to user ABC on the 'customer' table).
*   **COMMIT:**
    *   **Function:** Finalizes a transaction, making all data changes permanent in the database.
*   **ROLLBACK:**
    *   **Function:** Cancels an ongoing transaction, undoing all data changes and restoring the database to its state before the transaction began.

### 5. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

**Purpose:** To perform operations on the actual data within the database: input, modification, deletion, and searching.

#### A) Basic DML Operations

These statements work with data rows in tables. `FROM` designates the target table, and `WHERE` sets conditions.

*   **SELECT:**
    *   **Function:** Retrieves (searches) data values from a table.
    *   **Syntax:** `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
*   **INSERT:**
    *   **Function:** Adds new rows of data into a table.
    *   **Syntax (all columns):** `INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3);`
    *   **Syntax (specific columns):** `INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col3) VALUES (value1, value3);`
    *   **Syntax (from another table):** `INSERT INTO table_name SELECT col1, col2 FROM existing_table WHERE condition;`
*   **UPDATE:**
    *   **Function:** Modifies existing data in a table.
    *   **Syntax:** `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2 WHERE condition;`
    *   **Note:** If `WHERE` clause is omitted, all rows in the table will be updated.
*   **DELETE:**
    *   **Function:** Removes rows of data from a table.
    *   **Syntax:** `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    *   **Note:** If `WHERE` clause is omitted, all rows in the table will be deleted.

#### B) Aggregate DML Operations

These operations perform calculations on groups of rows.

*   **Aggregate Functions:**
    *   **COUNT(*):** Returns the number of rows.
    *   **SUM(column):** Calculates the total sum of values in a column (excluding NULLs).
    *   **AVG(column):** Calculates the average of values in a column (excluding NULLs).
*   **GROUP BY Clause:**
    *   **Function:** Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, allowing aggregate functions to be applied to each group.
    *   **Placement:** Placed after `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses.
    *   **Example:** Calculate total salary *by department*.
*   **HAVING Clause:**
    *   **Function:** Sets conditions for groups created by `GROUP BY`. (Similar to `WHERE` for individual rows, but `HAVING` filters groups).
*   **DISTINCT Option:**
    *   **Function:** Used with aggregate functions to consider only unique values.

**Example (using Employee table for aggregates):**
To get the number of employees, total salary, and average salary *per department*:
`SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees, SUM(agreed_annual_salary) AS total_salary, AVG(agreed_annual_salary) AS avg_salary FROM Employee GROUP BY department;`

#### C) Advanced DML Join Operations

Join operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

*   **NL (Nested Loop) Join:**
    *   **How it works:** Similar to a nested programming loop. It takes each row from the "outer table" (preceding table) and compares it with all rows in the "inner table" (following table) to find matches.
    *   **Performance:**
        *   **Recommendation:** Choose the table with fewer *resulting rows* after filtering as the outer table to optimize performance.
        *   **Advantage:** Efficient for narrow processing ranges, as it involves random access to data.

*   **Sort Merge Join:**
    *   **How it works:** Sorts both tables independently based on their join columns. Then, it merges the sorted results, comparing values as it scans through the sorted lists.
    *   **Advantage:** Efficient for processing a wide range of data, as it primarily uses sequential scan access.

01 Tupes of Relational  Database  Languages
A) DDL, DCL, DML
The relational  database  language  processes  the structure  and value stored  in a relational  database  and can be
classified  into the Data Definition  Language  (DDL), Data Control Language  (DCL), and Data Manipulation  Language
(OML).

B) Changes  in SQL and the characteristics  of SQL3
@ Changes  in SQL
SQL was developed  by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlain  and F. Raymond  Boyce in the early 1970s, and its
standards  have been changed  periodically  by the ANSI, as follows.
<Table  40> Changes  in SQL
Year Name Alias Characteristics
1986 SQL SQ-86 First SQL standard
. Adopted  a major revision  (ISO9075)  FIPS 127-2.

02 Data Definition  Language  (DDL)
A data definition  language  is used to describe  the database  schema in such a way that computers  can understand
it. Specifically,  it manages  the creation,  change, and deletion  of a table structure.  The main statements  of the data
definition  language  include  CREATE,  DROP. ALTER, and RENAME.
A) Types of data definition  language
@ CREATE:  Defining  and creating  an object
A table, view, index, schema,  function,  etc. can be defined using the CREATE  statement.  A primary  key and foreign
key can be defined  when creating  a table, and the object should not be the same as other created  objects.
@ ALTER: Changing  an object
Once  a table has been created,  it is best to keep its structure  intact. However,  it may be necessary  to add or delete
columns  and constraints  while using the table due to changes  in the work requirements  or the need for system
operation.  At this time, the structure  of the table can be changed  using the ALTER  statement.
© DROP: Deleting  an object
This command  is used to delete all data and structures  of the table when it has been created incorrectly  or is no
longer needed. However,  the referenced  constraint  related to the table concerned  should be deleted first before
deleting  a table. In Oracle, the CASCADE  CONSTRAINT  option can be used to delete it at the same time.
@ RENAME:  Changing  an object  name
This command  is used to change  the table name.

03 Data Control  Language  (DCL)
A data control language  is used to define and describe  data controls,  in order to use the database  in common.  The
main statements  include  GRANT,  REVOKE,  COMMIT,  and ROLLBACK.  Sometimes,  COMMIT  and ROLLBACK,  which are
used to control  nested  transactions,  are separated  and called TCL (Transaction  Control  Language).
