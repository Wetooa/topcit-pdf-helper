## Learning Guide: Business Security Management Systems

This guide simplifies essential concepts of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), Risk Management, and Personal Information Protection.

---

### 1. Information Security Management System (ISMS)

#### 1.1 What is ISMS?
*   **Definition:** A system that continuously manages information security measures to protect the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA triad)** of information assets.
*   **Process:** Based on risks, it involves ongoing development, implementation, operation, monitoring, review, and improvement of security systems.
*   **Benefit:** Helps organizations quickly respond to security breaches and minimize damage by implementing comprehensive security measures.

#### 1.2 Composition of ISMS
An ISMS generally consists of four main phases:
1.  **Establishment** of the management system
2.  **Risk Management**
3.  **Operation** of the management system
4.  **Inspection and Improvement** of the management system

#### 1.3 ISMS Certification Standard Overview
*   The certification standard combines:
    *   **5 Phases** (management system establishment/operation)
    *   **12 Certification Criteria** (for the management system)
    *   **92 Information Security Measures**
*   **Total:** 104 certification criteria items.

### 2. Risk Management

#### 2.1 What is Risk Management?
*   A process to:
    1.  **Identify** an organization's information assets.
    2.  **Identify risks** (legal, administrative, physical, technical) associated with these assets.
    3.  **Estimate values** for assets and risks.
    4.  **Prepare protection measures** against risks that exceed an acceptable **Degree of Assurance (DoA)**.
*   **DoA (Degree of Assurance):** The acceptable level of certainty or confidence in security measures.

#### 2.2 Key Concepts
*   **Risk:** The possibility that an unexpected situation occurs and negatively impacts an organization.
*   **Risk Equation:** Risk = Function of (Assets, Threats, Vulnerabilities)
    *   **Asset:** Something of value that needs protection (e.g., data, hardware, software).
    *   **Threat:** A potential danger or cause of harm to an asset (e.g., malware, unauthorized access).
    *   **Vulnerability:** A weakness in an asset or its protection that a threat can exploit (e.g., unpatched software, weak password).

#### 2.3 Risk Identification
*   Process of estimating the value of each information asset and identifying potential risks for each.

#### 2.4 Risk Assessment
*   **Purpose:** To analyze and evaluate identified risks.
*   **Scope:** Selected based on the ISMS scope, considering business, organizational, locational, asset, and technical characteristics.
*   **Methods:** Can be chosen based on whether risk can be quantified, or the desired approach.

##### A) Risk Assessment Methods (by Quantification)
*   **Quantitative Technique:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Measures damages in monetary units, uses past data, mathematical formulas, or probability.
    *   **Benefits:** Easier for cost-effectiveness analysis and budget planning, logical calculations.
    *   **Drawbacks:** Difficult to get accurate values, time-consuming.
*   **Qualitative Technique:**
    *   **Characteristics:** Expresses damage as intervals (e.g., High, Medium, Low), based on expert experience/knowledge (e.g., Delphi method, scenario method).
    *   **Benefits:** Used when damage cannot be easily quantified, easier to understand, faster analysis.
    *   **Drawbacks:** Prone to subjective judgment, difficult for cost-effectiveness analysis.

##### B) Risk Assessment Methods (by Approach)
*   **Baseline Approach:**
    *   **Content:** Sets a basic level of information security for all systems and implements standard protective measures.
    *   **Pros:** Less time and cost, suitable for achieving fundamental security.
    *   **Cons:** May not suit unique organizational characteristics, potentially leading to suboptimal security levels.
*   **Expert Judgment Method:**
    *   **Content:** Risk analysis based on expert knowledge and experience, rather than standardized methods.
    *   **Pros:** Cost-effective for small organizations.
    *   **Cons:** Lacks structured approach, making objective assessment difficult.
*   **Detailed Risk Approach:**
    *   **Content:** Measures asset values and risk levels, analyzes vulnerabilities, then determines risk levels and establishes specific protective measures.
    *   **Pros:** Tailored and appropriate protective measures for the organization.
    *   **Cons:** Requires professional knowledge, significant time, and effort.
*   **Combined Approach:**
    *   **Content:** Applies the **Detailed Risk Approach** to major or high-risk systems, and the **Baseline Approach** to other systems.
    *   **Pros:** Efficient use of time and resources, quick establishment of security strategies.
    *   **Cons:** Resources can be wasted if the target systems for each method are not clearly defined.

### 3. ISMS-P: Integrated Information & Personal Information Security Management System

#### 3.1 Overview of ISMS-P
*   **Definition:** An integrated certification system that combines the existing **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** and **Personal Information Management System (PIMS)** into a single, unified system for systematic protection.

#### 3.2 Composition of ISMS-P
*   ISMS-P consists of **102 certification criteria items**, broken down as:
    1.  **16 criteria** for establishing and operating management systems.
    2.  **64 requirements** for protective measures.
    3.  **22 requirements** for each personal information processing stage.

*   **Key Areas within ISMS-P:**
    *   **Management Systems:** Laying the foundation, risk management, operation, checking, and improvement.
    *   **Protective Measures:** Policy, organization, asset management, personnel security, outsider security, physical security, authentication/right management, access control, encryption, information system development/introduction, system/service operation/security management, incident prevention/response, disaster recovery.
    *   **Personal Information Handling:** Protective measures for collecting, holding/using, providing, and destroying personal information, and protecting information owner's rights.

---

### 4. Personal Information Protection (Basic Principles)

#### 4.1 Privacy Policy

##### A) Obtaining Consent for Personal Information Collection
*   **Timing:** Consent details must be presented *before* the user enters any personal information.
*   **User Control:** Users must have the option to **accept or reject** consent.
*   **Required Information for Consent:** When requesting consent, organizations must clearly present:
    *   The **purpose** of collecting and using personal information.
    *   The **items** of personal information to be collected.
    *   The **period** of personal information retention and use.
    *   Any **disadvantages** the user might face if they reject consent.

##### B) Personal Information Destruction Method
*   The privacy policy should reflect the method by which personal information will be destroyed (though specific methods are not detailed in this text).

+ Preview  for practical  business Security  management  system and
standard
Assistant  manager  Kim has continuously  check if there is a problem in the information  security
management  system, by operating  it for two months after installation  and has improved  it through
internal  audits.
Since then, he applied for the certification screening  of the information  security  management  system
and received  certification,  then decided  to confirm that the certification  is valid for three years and
that the information  security  management  system will be maintained  every year through  a follow-up
screening.
Let’s review what the information  security  management  system that he has installed  and operated  is,
as well as the available  risk management  methods  and related certification  systems  in detail.
01 Information  security  management  system
A) Overview  of the information  security  management  system  (ISMS)
@® Concept  of the information  security  management  system
The information  security  management  system refers to a system  that manages  information  security  measures
in order to maintain  the confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of information  assets. It continuously
manages  and operates  various processes,  such as information  security  system development,  countermeasure
implementation,  operation,  monitoring  and review, and improvement,  based on risks.
Enterprises  can quickly respond  and minimize  damage  when security  breach incidents  occur, by implementing
comprehensive  information  security  measures  by building  and operating  the information  security  management
system.
@ Composition  of the information  security  management  system
As shown in [Figure 29], the information  security  management  system consists  of the establishment  of the
management  system, risk management,  management  system operation,  and management  system inspection
and improvement.

© Risk identification
+ A risk means the possibility  that an unexpected  situation  occurs and affects (damages)  an organization,  and
can be expressed  as a function  of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.  The value of each information  asset
should be estimated,  and risks of each asset should be identified  during the risk identification process.
@ Risk assessment
+ The scope of risk analysis  should be selected  based on the scope of the information  security  management
system, according  to the business,  organizational,  locational,  asset, and technical  characteristics  during the
risk assessment  process.
+ For efficient  risk analysis,  a quantitative  or qualitative  method should be selected,  depending  on whether
the risk can be quantified  or not. Alternatively,  the baseline  approach,  detailed risk approach,  or combined
approach  should be selected,  depending  on the approach.
