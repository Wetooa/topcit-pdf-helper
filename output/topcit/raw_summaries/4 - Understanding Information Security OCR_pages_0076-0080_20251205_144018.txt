## Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases

The Secure SDLC integrates security throughout the software development process.

1.  **Requirement Definition Phase**
    *   **Purpose:** Define security objectives and analyze potential threats.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Identify security objectives based on project/software characteristics.
        *   Analyze potential threats, security weaknesses, and their impact.
        *   Derive specific security requirements for software development.

2.  **Analysis/Design Phase**
    *   **Purpose:** Design security into the overall architecture.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Design security architecture.
        *   Incorporate security requirements into the entire architecture design.
        *   Implement developer security training.
        *   Design security test plans.

3.  **Coding Phase**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensure code adheres to secure coding practices.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Define secure coding rules, considering programming language strengths/weaknesses.
        *   Conduct static unit tests on developed code.
        *   Verify compliance with predefined secure coding rules.
        *   For commercial packages, check security vulnerabilities and known actions.

4.  **Testing Phase**
    *   **Purpose:** Dynamically test security and identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Conduct dynamic unit tests on the developed program.
        *   Test the usability of the applied security features.
        *   Identify and apply security improvements by checking infrastructure and application vulnerabilities.

## Major Secure Coding Techniques (for Java)

### 1. SQL Injection Attack

*   **Attack Overview:**
    *   **What it is:** Occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into web application input fields (e.g., forms, URL parameters) that are then executed by the database.
    *   **Cause:** Lack of validation for user-entered data linked to a database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized reading, manipulation, or deletion of database information.

*   **Coding Technique:**
    *   **Use `PreparedStatement`:** Transfer *compiled* query statements (constants) to the database using `PreparedStatement` objects.
    *   **Parameter Binding:** Use `setXXX()` methods (e.g., `setString()`, `setInt()`) to bind external input values to query parameters (`?` placeholders) in `PreparedStatement`. This prevents the input from altering the SQL query structure.
    *   **Filter Special Characters:** If `PreparedStatement` cannot be used, manually filter special characters and SQL reserved words.
    *   **Framework Modules:** Utilize input verification and security modules provided by frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring).

*   **Code Principle (Safe vs. Unsafe):**
    *   **Unsafe:** Directly concatenates user input into the SQL query string.
    *   **Safe:** Uses `PreparedStatement` with `?` placeholders for dynamic values, separating the query structure from user input.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack

*   **Attack Overview:**
    *   **What it is:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into a web page. When other users view this page, their browsers execute the malicious script.
    *   **Cause:** Using unverified external input to create dynamic web pages without proper encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Information leakage (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens), unauthorized actions, defacement, or redirection, all executed with the user's browser privileges.

*   **Coding Technique:**
    *   **Character Conversion (Output Encoding):** Replace special characters that have meaning in HTML/JavaScript with their corresponding HTML entities *before* displaying user-supplied data.
        *   `<` becomes `&lt;`
        *   `>` becomes `&gt;`
        *   `&` becomes `&amp;`
        *   `"` becomes `&quot;`
        *   `'` becomes `&#39;` (or `&apos;` in HTML5, though `&#39;` is more universally supported in XML contexts and often preferred)
    *   **Whitelist HTML Tags:** If allowing certain HTML tags (e.g., in a rich text editor), use a whitelist approach to permit *only* safe, explicitly allowed tags and attributes. Remove or escape all others.

### 3. OS Command Injection Attack

*   **Attack Overview:**
    *   **What it is:** An attacker provides malformed input that causes the application to execute unintended operating system commands on the server.
    *   **Cause:** User input that has not been properly validated is used directly as part of or an entire OS command.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of system commands, potentially leading to privilege changes, data manipulation, or system compromise.

*   **Coding Technique:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Command Execution:** Configure application programs so that system commands are not directly exposed or transferred from the web interface to the server's internal command execution.
    *   **Never Use Unverified Input:** Do not use external input directly as an internal system command without stringent verification.
    *   **Command Whitelisting:** If commands must be generated or selected based on external input, specify a predefined *whitelist* of allowed commands and arguments. Only execute commands that explicitly match an entry in this list.

*   **Code Principle (Safe vs. Unsafe):**
    *   **Unsafe:** Directly executes user-provided input as a system command using methods like `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.
    *   **Safe:** Checks the user-provided command against a predefined list of allowed commands. If the command is not in the whitelist, it is rejected.

### 4. Unrestricted Upload of Dangerous Files Attack

*   **Attack Overview:**
    *   **What it is:** A vulnerability that allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable script files (e.g., `.asp`, `.jsp`, `.php`, `.sh`).
    *   **Cause:** Insufficient validation of file types, content, or names during the upload process.
    *   **Impact:** If the uploaded script can be executed via the web server, the attacker can gain control over the system (e.g., by uploading a "web shell" to execute arbitrary commands).

*   **Coding Technique:**
    *   **File Extension Whitelisting:** Only allow uploads for file extensions explicitly defined in a *whitelist* (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`). Reject all other extensions.
    *   **Remove Execute Attribute:** If the operating system or file system allows, remove the execute attribute from uploaded files to prevent them from being run as scripts.
    *   **Content Type Validation:** Validate the file's *actual* content type (MIME type) in addition to its extension, as extensions can be spoofed.
    *   **Store Outside Web Root:** Store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible by the web server (if possible) or ensure the web server is configured *not* to execute scripts from the upload directory.

[Figure  35] SQL injection  security  vulnerability
+ Coding  technique:
Uses a method  that transfers  the compiled  query statement  (constant)  to the database,  using the Prepared
Statement  object, etc. When using Prepared  Statement,  filter special characters  and query reserved  words
that are used for the database  query. When using a framework,  such as Struts and Spring, use the module
that verifies  the external  input values and security  module,  according  to the circumstances.
<Table 19> Code example
String  gubun = request.getParameter(“gubun’):
String sql = “select  b_gubun
+" aidx .
, ab_id
, date_format(a.w_date,  ‘%Y-%m-%d’)  *
, apwd .
, a.content
, bidx
, asecurity
+* from board a left outer join tail b on a.idx = b.b_id “
+“ where b_gubun  =” + gubun +” *;
Connection  con = db.getCon();
Statement  stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet  rs = stmt.executeQuery(sq]):
The value of “gubun’,  which is entered  from the outside,  is used to create  an SQL query, without  any verification.  In
this case, if a’ or ‘a’ = ‘a is entered  as the value of “gubun’,  the conditional  clause is changed  to b_gubun  = ‘a’ or ‘a’ =
‘a’, and the structure  of the query is changed.  Then, all the contents  of the “board”  table are retrieved
String  gubun = request.getParameter(‘gubun’);Unsafe
code +e ett t+
String sql = “select  b_gubun
+" aidx .
, ab_id
, date  format(a.w_date,  ‘%Y-%m-%d’)  *
, apwd .
, a.content
, bidx
, asecurity
+" from board a left  outer  join tail b on a.idx = b.b_id *
+“ where b_gubun  =  ? *:
Connection  con = db.getConnection();
PreparedStatement  pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sq|):
pstmt.setString(1,  gubun):
ResultSet  rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
The PreparedStatement  object  that receives  a parameter  should be created  as a constant  string, and the parameter
should be set with the setXXX  method  to prevent  etemal input from changing  the structure  of the query statement.Safe
