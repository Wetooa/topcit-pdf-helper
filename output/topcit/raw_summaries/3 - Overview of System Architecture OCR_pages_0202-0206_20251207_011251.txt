# System Architecture: Recent Trends & Key Concepts

## Introduction: Modern Network Trends

The network field is rapidly evolving due to:
*   **High-speed data transmission.**
*   **Convergence technologies** (combining different network types/services).
*   **Quality of Service (QoS)** guarantees for Internet traffic, enabling multimedia and Internet telephony.
*   Expansion of **Internet of Things (IoT) network-based technologies**.
*   Introduction of **Software-based networks** (differentiated from traditional structures).

## 1. Multimedia Networks

Multimedia networks handle various data types like text, images, video, and audio.

### 1.1 Data Compression

Compression is crucial for efficient transmission of large multimedia files. It's categorized into two main types:

#### 1.1.1 Lossless Compression (Reversible)
*   **Concept:** Restores the original data perfectly without any information loss during decompression.
*   **Characteristic:** Lower compression rate compared to lossy compression.
*   **Common Methods:**
    *   **Run-length encoding (RLE):** Expresses consecutive repeated symbols by the symbol and its repetition count.
    *   **Dictionary coding:** Creates a dictionary, and if a string is found, its code value (index) is sent instead.
    *   **Huffman coding:** Assigns short codes to frequent symbols and long codes to less frequent ones.
    *   **Arithmetic coding:** Maps the entire message to a small section [0,1] and encodes it as a binary pattern.

#### 1.1.2 Lossy Compression (Irreversible)
*   **Concept:** Achieves higher compression rates by discarding redundant or less important data, meaning the restored data won't exactly match the original.
*   **Characteristic:** Compromises some accuracy for increased compression.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Prediction coding:** Quantizes the *difference* between PCM samples instead of the samples themselves, requiring fewer bits. Used for digitizing analog signals.
    *   **Transform coding:** Transforms signals (e.g., from time/space domain to frequency domain) before compression.

### 1.2 Multimedia Data Types

*   **Text:**
    *   **Form:** Plain text and non-linear hypertext.
    *   **Language:** Unicode for symbols.
    *   **Compression:** Typically uses lossless methods.
*   **Images (Still Images):**
    *   **Definition:** Photos, fax pages, video frames. Transmitted as binary data.
    *   **Transformation Process (e.g., JPEG):**
        1.  **Transformation:** JPEG uses DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) for compression, inverse DCT for decompression (on 8x8 blocks).
        2.  **Quantization:** Converts real numbers from DCT output to integers, setting some values to zero (lossy step).
        3.  **Coding:** Arranges data in zigzag order after quantization, then performs lossless compression (e.g., run-length decoding, arithmetic coding).
*   **Video Data:**
    *   **Composition:** Series of frames. Requires high transmission rates due to many images.
    *   **Compression Methods:**
        *   **Spatial compression:** Compresses each frame independently (e.g., JPEG applied to individual frames).
        *   **Temporal compression:** Removes redundancy *between* frames. Uses:
            *   **I-frames:** Independent frames.
            *   **B-frames & P-frames:** Reference other I-frames for compression.
*   **Audio Data:**
    *   **Digitization:** Analog audio signals are converted to digital using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
    *   **ADC Processes:** Sampling and Quantization.

### 1.3 Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS ensures a certain level of performance for data transmission in multimedia networks.

#### 1.3.1 RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)
*   **Function:** Allocates fixed network bandwidth from source to destination.
*   **Mechanism:** An IETF signaling protocol that reserves queue space.
    *   **PATH message:** Sent from source to all receiving devices on the path, containing necessary info for the receiver.
    *   **RESV message:** Sent by the receiver towards the source (upstream) to reserve router resources.
*   **Fallback:** If a router doesn't support RSVP, packets are delivered using "best-effort" method.

#### 1.3.2 TOS (Type of Service) Field Utilization
*   **Location:** 1-byte field in an IP datagram.
*   **Function:** Determines processing priority based on a set value.
*   **Priority Levels:** Divided into 8 levels (Class 0 to 7); higher number means higher priority.
*   **Field Breakdown:**
    *   **Precedence (first field):** Indicates packet priority/importance.
    *   **TOS fields:** Indicate network balance priorities (e.g., throughput, delay, reliability, cost).
    *   **MBZ (must be zero) field:** Currently unused.
*   **TOS Field Binary Values (4-bit):**
    *   **1000:** Priority on delay minimization
    *   **0100:** Priority on processing volume
    *   **0010:** Priority on reliability
    *   **0001:** Priority on cost minimization
    *   **0000:** General service

## 2. Internet Telephony (VoIP)

### 2.1 What is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)?

*   **Definition:** Communication technology enabling voice calls over an IP network using packet data.
*   **System Components:**
    *   **Media Gateway:** Exchanges multimedia data, delivers it to the appropriate network, and is controlled by protocols like MGCP.
    *   **Signaling Gateway:** Performs call signaling using protocols (H.323, SIP, MGCP, MEGACO) and converts signals between PSTN (traditional phone) and IP networks.

### 2.2 VoIP Call Signaling Protocols

These protocols manage the setup, modification, and termination of calls.

#### 2.2.1 SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
*   **Type:** Application layer signaling protocol.
*   **Function:** Establishes, modifies, and terminates multimedia communication sessions (voice, video, data).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Operates independently of lower-layer transport protocols (TCP/UDP).
    *   Scalable and text-based (similar to HTTP).
    *   Enables call control in packet-switching networks and Internet multimedia applications.
    *   Supports text-based addressing (URL, E-mail format).
    *   Allows message parsing and extensions.
*   **Protocol Stack:**
    *   **SIP API (top)**
    *   **SIP Codec (Audio/Video)**
    *   **RTP/RTCP (for real-time audio/video transmission)**
    *   **TCP/UDP (transport layer)**
    *   **IP (network layer)**
    *   **Physical (bottom)**

#### 2.2.2 H.323
*   **Standard:** ITU-T standard.
*   **Function:** Provides voice, data, and video services over LANs that do *not* guarantee quality.
*   **Use Case:** Widely adopted by early VoIP service providers because it allows multimedia services without altering existing network infrastructure.

01 Multimedia  Network
A) Graphic  compression  type
Video data compression,  which accounts  for most of the traffic in a multimedia  network,  can be divided  into lossless
compression  (reversible  compression)  and lossy compression  (irreversible  compression).  Lossless  compression,  also
called reversible  compression,  refers to restoring  a compressed  image, without  information  loss of the original data
when decompressing.  It is characterized  by a lower compression  rate than lossy compression.
Lossy compression,  also called irreversible  compression,  refers to a compression  method  that the restored  data, when
the compressed  data is restored,  does not match the original data from before compression  because  some data is
lost.
@ Lossless  compression
Since the compression  and decompression  algorithms  are the exact opposite  of each other, the compression  method
preserves  the original data’s integrity,  and no part of the data is lost during processing.  Leading  lossless  compression
methods  include run-length  encoding,  dictionary  decoding,  Huffman  coding, dictionary  coding, and arithmetic  coding.
{Table 72) Lossless  Compression
Compression  method Description
Run-length  encoding + Amethod  expressing  consecutively  repeated  symbols,  in terms of the symbol and repetition  count
(RLE) (run-length)
+ Amethod  that creates  a dictionary  while scanning  a message,  and if an entry character  string in the
Dictionary  coding dictionary  is found in the message,  the code value (index  value) of the entry is sent instead  of the
string
+ Amethod  that encodes  data in a binary  pattern  and allocates  shortcodes  to symbols  that occur more
frequently  and longs codes to symbols  that occur less frequently
+ Amethod  that maps the entire message  to a small section in [0,1] and encodes  the small section ina
binary patternHuffman  coding
Arithmetic  coding
@ Lossy compression
The lossy compression  method  compromises  some accuracy  in order to increase  the compression  rate, by allowing
the loss of redundant  or unnecessary  data. There are two types of lossy compression  methods:  prediction  coding
and transform  coding. The prediction  coding method is used for digitizing  the analog signal. Instead of separately
quantizing  the PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)  samples, it quantizes  the difference.  The difference values are smaller
than the actual sample  values, so fewer bits are required. The transform  coding method  transforms  a signal, from one
domain  (mainly  time and space domain),  to another  domain  (mainly  frequency  domain),  then compresses  it.
B) Multimedia  data
Multimedia  data includes  text, image, video, and audio data. The text has the form of plain text and non-linear
hypertext,  and the basic language  is Unicode  for expressing  symbols  and uses a lossless  compression  method.
In multimedia,an image is called a still image and refers to a photo, fax page, or video frame. As shown in [Figure 1],
an image is transmitted as  binary data, through  a transformation  process,  a quantization  process,  and an encoding
process.  The data is converted  back into an image, through  the reverse  process.

Overview  of System  Architecture
In the transformation  process,  the JPEG uses DCT (Discrete  Cosine  Transform)  in the first stage of compression,  and
the decompression  uses the inverse DCT method.  The transformation  and inverse  transformation  apply 8 X 8 blocks.
The quantization  process integerizes  the real number  of the DCT transform  output and converts  some values to
zero. The coding process  arranges  data in a zigzag order...
