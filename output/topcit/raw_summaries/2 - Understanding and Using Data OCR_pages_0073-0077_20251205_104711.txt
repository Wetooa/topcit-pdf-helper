# Database Normalization: Learning Guide (2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)

Normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

## 1. Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Goal:** Eliminate partial functional dependencies.

*   **Condition for NOT being in 2NF:**
    *   A table is not in 2NF if a non-key attribute (an attribute not part of any candidate key) depends only on *part* of a composite primary key.
    *   This is called a **partial functional dependency**.
*   **How to achieve 2NF:**
    *   Divide the table into two or more tables.
    *   One table will contain the partial dependency (e.g., the part of the composite key and the non-key attribute that depends on it).
    *   The other table(s) will contain the remaining attributes and the full primary key.

**Example (Simplified from Figure 29, assumes composite key of `StudentID` and `Subject code`):**

| Student ID | Subject code | Student Name | Subject name | Grade |
| :--------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---- |
| 1111       | D11          | Hong Gildong | Database     | A     |
| 1111       | O22          | Hong Gildong | OS           | B     |

*   **Problem:** `Student Name` depends only on `Student ID` (part of the composite key). `Subject name` depends only on `Subject code` (part of the composite key).
*   **Solution (2NF):** Decompose into three tables:
    1.  **Student:** `StudentID` (PK), `Student Name`
    2.  **Subject:** `Subject code` (PK), `Subject name`
    3.  **Enrollment:** `StudentID` (FK, PK), `Subject code` (FK, PK), `Grade`

## 2. Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Goal:** Eliminate transitive functional dependencies.

*   **Precondition:** The table must already be in 2NF.
*   **Condition for NOT being in 3NF:**
    *   A table is not in 3NF if a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.
    *   This is called a **transitive dependency**: A → B and B → C, then A → C.
*   **How to achieve 3NF:**
    *   Divide the table into two or more tables.
    *   One table will contain the original primary key and the attributes that directly depend on it.
    *   Another table will contain the non-key attribute that is the determinant of the transitive dependency, and the attributes that depend on it. Establish a foreign key relationship.

**Example (Simplified from Figure 31, assumes `StudentID` is PK):**

| StudentID | Name         | Department          | Department Office    |
| :-------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :------------------- |
| 1111      | Hong Gildong | Computer Engineering| Engineering Building |
| 3333      | Ryu Gwenun   | Physics             | Natural Science Bldg |

*   **Problem:** `Department Office` depends on `Department`, and `Department` depends on `StudentID`. This is a transitive dependency: `StudentID` → `Department` → `Department Office`.
*   **Solution (3NF):** Decompose into two tables:
    1.  **Student:** `StudentID` (PK), `Name`, `Department` (FK)
    2.  **Department:** `Department` (PK), `Department Office`

## 3. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

**Goal:** Stricter version of 3NF, handles cases where 3NF might still have anomalies involving overlapping candidate keys.

*   **Precondition:** The table must already be in 3NF.
*   **Condition for NOT being in BCNF:**
    *   A table is not in BCNF if there is a functional dependency (X → Y) where X is not a **candidate key**.
    *   (A **candidate key** is any attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row in a table.)
*   **How to achieve BCNF:**
    *   Identify functional dependencies where the determinant is not a candidate key.
    *   Decompose the table into new tables such that the determinant becomes the primary key of a new table, and the dependent attributes move with it.

**Example (Simplified from Figure 32, assumes `(Professor, Subject name)` is PK):**

| Professor | Subject name | Textbook name |
| :-------- | :----------- | :------------ |
| P1        | Data Structure | Book1         |
| P1        | Network      | Book2         |
| P2        | Network      | Book3         |

*   **Problem:**
    *   `(Professor, Subject name)` → `Textbook name` (This is fine, as `(Professor, Subject name)` is the PK).
    *   However, `Textbook name` → `Subject name` also exists (e.g., Book1 is always for Data Structure).
    *   Here, `Textbook name` is a determinant, but it is NOT a candidate key.
*   **Solution (BCNF):** Decompose into two tables:
    1.  **Professor_Textbook:** `Professor` (FK, PK), `Textbook name` (FK, PK)
    2.  **Textbook_Subject:** `Textbook name` (PK), `Subject name`

## 4. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

**Goal:** Eliminate multi-valued dependencies (MVDs).

*   **Precondition:** The table must already be in BCNF.
*   **Concept:**
    *   4NF is concerned with removing **multi-valued dependencies** (MVDs) when more than two occur in a single relation (table).
    *   It addresses situations where attributes are independent of each other but both depend on a third attribute.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Applies when there's a semantic association constraint between attributes.
    *   Established when all attributes are primary identifiers (meaning it's focused on keys and how they relate).
    *   MVDs occur with three or more associated attributes.
    *   Normalization is based on *semantic association*, not functional dependency.
*   **Problem Scenario:**
    *   Imagine attributes A, B, C.
    *   Relationships: A-B are related, A-C are related, but C-B are *not* related.
    *   If these are put into one table, it creates MVDs.
    *   **Example:** An `Employee` (A) has `Holding Technology` (B) and works on `Support Project` (C). `Employee` is related to `Technology`, `Employee` is related to `Project`, but `Technology` and `Project` are *independent* of each other.
*   **Anomalies caused by MVDs:**
    *   **Input error:** To add a new project for an employee, you might have to repeat all their technologies for that project, even if the tech isn't related to the project.
    *   **Modification error:** If an employee's project changes, you have to update multiple rows for each technology they hold.
    *   **Deletion error:** Deleting a technology might inadvertently delete project history if they are linked without direct relationship.
*   **How to achieve 4NF:**
    *   Separate unrelated multi-valued attributes into their own tables.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Employee:** `Employee Number` (PK), `Employee Name`, `Address`
        *   **Holding Skills:** `Employee Number` (FK, PK), `Technology Code` (FK, PK)
        *   **Support Project:** `Employee Number` (FK, PK), `Project Code` (FK, PK)
        *   (Optional lookup tables like `Skill` and `Project` for details)

## 5. Fifth Normal Form (5NF) / Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)

**Goal:** Eliminate join dependencies; prevent loss of information when joining tables back together.

*   **Precondition:** The table must already be in 4NF.
*   **Concept:**
    *   A table is in 5NF if every join dependency in it is implied by the candidate keys.
    *   It's for complex situations where a table can be losslessly decomposed into smaller tables, but those smaller tables cannot be joined back without creating spurious (incorrect) tuples, unless a specific **join dependency** exists.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Normalization occurs in the primary key.
    *   Requires a join relationship between independent attributes.
    *   Created after being separated into associative relations.
*   **Problem Scenario:**
    *   Imagine attributes A, B, C.
    *   Relationships: A-B are related, A-C are related, C-B are related.
    *   However, A-B-C (all three together) are *not* directly related in all combinations.
    *   **Example:** `Supplier` (A), `Part` (B), `Project` (C).
        *   A supplier supplies a certain part (A-B).
        *   A supplier supports a certain project (A-C).
        *   A certain part is used for a certain project (B-C).
        *   But, there is *no direct association* for how a *certain supplier* has used a *certain part* for a *certain project*. (A-B-C is not universally true or implied).
*   **Anomalies:** Designing this as a single table leads to input, modification, and deletion errors similar to 4NF if the three-way relationship doesn't inherently exist for all data.
*   **How to achieve 5NF:**
    *   Decompose the table into multiple tables, each representing a true, direct many-to-many relationship (binary or ternary) between attributes, such that joining them back together is lossless and doesn't create spurious information.
    *   **Example:** Instead of a single (Supplier, Part, Project) table, decompose into:
        1.  **Supplier_Part:** `Supplier ID` (PK, FK), `Part ID` (PK, FK)
        2.  **Supplier_Project:** `Supplier ID` (PK, FK), `Project ID` (PK, FK)
        3.  **Part_Project:** `Part ID` (PK, FK), `Project ID` (PK, FK)

A) Concept  of the fourth normalization
The fourth normalization  is the process  of removing  more than two multi-valued  dependencies  (MVD) if they occur in
one relation.
B) Characteristics  of the fourth normalization
@ The fourth normalization  is possible  only when there is a semantic  association  constraint  between  attributes.
@ It is established  when all attributes  are primary  identifiers.  (Primary  key)
© Multi-valued  dependency  can be established  when there are three or more associated  attributes.
@ It corresponds  to normalization  by semantic  association,  not by the functional  dependency  relationship.
@© When there are three attributes,  A, B, and C, there is a semantic  relationship  as follows. However,  an anomaly  occurs
when creating  a table using these attributes.
+ Relationship  between  A and B: A and  B are related.
+ Relationship  between  A and C: A and C are related.
+ Relationship  between  C and B: C and B are not related.
