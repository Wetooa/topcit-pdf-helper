## Learning Guide: Enterprise Architecture (EA) & Information Strategic Planning (ISP)

### 1. Enterprise Architecture (EA) Reference Models

Reference models provide guidance for developing different aspects of an EA.

*   **Application Architecture (Service Component Reference Model - SRM):**
    *   Extracts information needed for tasks.
    *   Defines activities for processing/managing information.
    *   Creates standards for application development functions, characteristics, and environment.
    *   Identifies necessary documents for business model activities.
*   **Data Architecture (Data Reference Model - DRM):**
    *   Designs data models by understanding relationships between information, data, and structures.
*   **Technology Architecture (Technology Reference Model - TRM):**
    *   Defines criteria for selecting infrastructure to support business, data, applications, and other technologies.
    *   Defines technical support services.
*   **Standard Profile:**
    *   Defines a detailed technology list for the Technology Architecture (e.g., JAVA architecture version: JDK 2.0).

**Purpose of Reference Models:**
*   Provide early reference cases from similar industries/sectors to guide EA deployment.
*   **Government EA Reference Model:** Used for government-wide EA, also as a reference for departmental EAs.
    *   **Note:** Government-wide EA includes **Security Architecture** in addition to the four above.

### 2. EA Frameworks

Frameworks provide structured approaches for establishing an Enterprise Architecture. Key frameworks include:

*   **Zachman Framework:**
    *   **Most often used** for establishing an EA.
    *   Defined as a matrix using "view" and "perspective."
    *   **5 Perspectives:** Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, Subcontractor.
    *   **6 Ways of Describing Each Perspective:** Data, Function, Network, People, Time, Motivation.
*   **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework):**
    *   An open framework focused on **interoperability between companies**.
    *   **Components:**
        *   Architecture Development Method (ADM) cycle.
        *   Technology Reference Model (TRM).
        *   Standards Information Point (SIP) - a database of summarized standards.
    *   Uses a "building block" concept to resolve component-level problems.
*   **FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework):**
    *   Developed by the U.S. CIO Council (1998).
    *   **Structure:** 8 components and a 4-step progressive structure.
    *   Manages all Zachman Framework model contents.
    *   **Defines 5 Reference Models:** Business Reference Model (BRM), Performance Reference Model (PRM), Data Reference Model (DRM), Service Component Reference Model (SRM), Technology Reference Model (TRM).
    *   These models are interrelated and based on the Zachman Framework.
    *   Forms the basis of Japan's EA framework.
    *   Includes an approach for each segment, implementation plan, and AS-IS/TO-BE gap analysis.

### 3. Information Strategic Planning (ISP)

#### A) Overview of ISP
*   **Definition:** Information Strategic Plan. Often referred to as "ISP establishment."
*   **Purpose:** To define a **vision for the information system and management structure** that supports an enterprise's mid-to-long-term goals and business plan. It's a rough sketch of IT system deployment direction for long-term objectives.

#### B) ISP Deployment Procedure
1.  **Environment Analysis:**
    *   **Company Environment:** Analyze external/internal factors using tools like SWOT, 5-Force, 7S, 4C.
    *   **Information Environment:** Review technology requirements, trends, and new technology application feasibility.
2.  **Current Operation Analysis:**
    *   Analyze existing business processes to identify problems and areas for improvement.
    *   Analyze existing information systems.
    *   Gather stakeholder requirements and improvement agenda.
    *   **Benchmarking:** Compare with similar industries to correct missing/distorted information.
3.  **Informatization Plan:** Use analysis results to determine improvement directions, develop improved procedures, and create an informatization plan.

    *   **Strategy Establishment Stage:**
        *   Informatization goal model specification form (new information model).
        *   Master plan for building the "To-Be" work system (complete ISP, define & prioritize projects).

### 4. Comparison of ISP and EA Concepts

| Category       | ISP (Information Strategic Planning)                                                               | EA (Enterprise Architecture)                                                                                    |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objectives** | Link management strategy with informatization strategy; introduce new IT.                      | Blueprint for seamless integration of business and information resources.                                        |
| **Scope**      | Informatization strategy; can be company-wide, service, or departmental.                         | Architectures for technology (ITA), business (BA), application (AA), data (DA), etc., company-wide.             |
| **Main Activities** | - Analysis of business management environment, IT trends, tasks, IT system structure. <br> - Establishment of IT strategy & management system. <br> - Design future task handling process & IT system. <br> - Establish To-Be roadmap. | - Establish ITA direction & guidelines, reference models (BRM, SRM, DRM, TRM/SP, PRM). <br> - Analyze AS-IS architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Establish TO-BE architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Establish implementation plan & ITA management system. |
| **Key Outputs** | - Reports on analysis (business environment, IT trends, job/IT system). <br> - IT vision & strategy. <br> - Implementation agenda & roadmap. | - Company-wide architecture vision, rules, architecture matrix. <br> - Current & target architecture (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA). <br> - Plan for target architecture implementation. |

**Key Relationship:**
*   ISP deals with plans that fall within the scope of EA but are **more microscopic** and focused on the **informatization strategy**.
*   EA is deployed under a company's target architecture, aligning IT direction with management strategy using the latest IT.

**EA Management:**
*   EA must be managed to **respond quickly to changes** in the business management environment.
*   It needs to be **flexible** for quick implementation of company agendas through continuous updating.
*   The EA roadmap must be **shared** across the organization.

component  reference  model, data reference  model, and technology  reference  model, respectively.  The reference
model provides  early reference  cases in an identical  business sector  or similar industries  that a company  could use
as a guide when it seeks to deploy an EA. There is also a government  EA reference  model for government-wide  EA,
which is used as a reference  when EAs are deployed  at the departmental  level.

04 Concept  of ISP
A) Overview  of ISP (Information  Strategic  Planning)
The literal meaning  of the acronym  ISP is “Information  Strategy  Plan’. Generally,  the term “ISP establishment”  is used
more frequently  as an overarching  concept.
ISP can present  a vision for the information  system and information  management  structure  that can support  an
enterprise  or organization  when it is developing  its mid-to-long  term vision and goals and business  plan. In other
words, it can be understood  as a plan that provides  a rough sketch of the direction  of information  system deployment
to aid the enterprise  in realizing  its long-term  objectives.
B) ISP deployment  procedure
In order to deploy an ISP, the external/internal  environment  of the company  and the information  environment  must be
analyzed  first of all. When analyzing  the environment  of a company,  tools like SWOT, 5-Force,7S  and 4C are commonly
used. In addition,  when analyzing  the information  environment,  the technology  requirements  corresponding  to the
purpose  and background  of a project  must be reviewed  in detail by studying  the technology  trends and analyzing  the
application  of new technologies.
The next step consists  in analyzing  the current  operation  of the company.  The most important  item that must be
checked  in this analysis  is the business  process.  A careful study of the business  process in its current  ...
