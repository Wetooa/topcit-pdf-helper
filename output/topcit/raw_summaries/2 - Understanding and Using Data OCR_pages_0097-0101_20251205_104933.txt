### Part 1: Data Structure & Management Fundamentals

#### 1. Data Structure Concepts

These models and components define how data is organized and stored.

*   **Conceptual Data Model:**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the business view of data.
    *   **Focus:** Key entities (main objects), relationships between them, and the overall subject area to meet business requirements.
*   **Data Reference Model:**
    *   **Purpose:** Standardizes data elements.
    *   **Focus:** Defines standard data and control items by business/subject area to build data architecture, enable data model interoperability, and reuse existing models.
*   **Logical Data Model:**
    *   **Purpose:** Translates the conceptual model into a logical design.
    *   **Focus:** Specifies logical data sets, control items, and relationships based on the conceptual model. (Independent of specific database systems).
*   **Physical Data Model:**
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the logical model for a specific database system.
    *   **Focus:** Actualizes the logical model, considering the characteristics and performance of the chosen Database Management System (DBMS).
*   **Database:**
    *   **Definition:** The result of implementing a physical data model; a repository storing actual data.
*   **User View:**
    *   **Definition:** The interface or output (e.g., screen, report) of an information system that displays data to the user.

#### 2. Data Management Processes

These are activities involved in handling data throughout its lifecycle.

*   **Data Standard Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Defines, changes, and manages standard dictionaries (words, domains, terms, codes, data elements).
    *   **Goal:** Cleans and improves data quality, ensures compliance with data standards.
*   **Requirements Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Collects, classifies, and incorporates user requirements into data, applications, and the overall system.
*   **Data Model Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Updates the data model to reflect changes from requirements; maintains consistency between the model and the database system structure.
*   **Data Flow Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Manages the entire process of creating source data, storing it, and processing it (e.g., extraction, transformation, loading - ETL).
*   **Database Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Ensures stable operation and management of a database.
    *   **Includes:** Backup, security, performance tuning, and monitoring.
*   **Database Security Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Protects the database and its data from unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Includes:** User authentication, access control, log analysis, and auditing.
*   **Data Utilization Management:**
    *   **Activity:** Measures data quality by selecting specific data and quality metrics, then analyzes causes of non-compliance with quality requirements.

#### 3. Data Quality Management Maturity Model

This model helps systematically assess and improve an organization's data quality control.

*   **Purpose:** Measures the level of data quality control based on objective criteria and provides guidelines for improvement.
*   **Three Key Elements:**

    1.  **Data Quality Standard:**
        *   **Data Validation Aspects:** Accuracy, Consistency
        *   **Data Utilization Aspects:** Usability, Accessibility, Timeliness, Security

    2.  **Data Quality Control Process:**
        *   Identifies processes needed to improve accuracy, consistency, usability, accessibility, timeliness, and security.
        *   Some processes may correspond to one standard, others to multiple.

    3.  **Data Quality Control Maturity Level:**
        *   Defined on a scale of 1 to 5.
        *   Higher levels indicate more systematic and sophisticated data management.

### Part 2: Data Standardization

#### 1. Overview of Data Standardization

**Data standardization** means establishing and applying consistent principles (name, definition, format, rule) for all data elements across an organization.

*   **Why it's important:**
    *   Data is crucial for strategic decision-making.
    *   Unifies data elements dispersed across various systems.
    *   Clarifies data meaning and resolves conflicting interpretations.

#### 2. Necessity of Data Standardization

*   **Improves Communication:** Ensures everyone uses and understands data names consistently.
*   **Reduces Effort:** Makes it faster and easier to locate necessary data.
*   **Enhances Data Quality:** Applies consistent data formats and rules, leading to higher quality data.
*   **Lowers Costs:** Reduces expenses for data conversion and cleansing when integrating different information systems.

#### 3. Components of Data Standardization

*   **Core Components:**
    *   Data standards themselves.
    *   A dedicated data management organization.
    *   Clearly defined data standardization procedures.
*   **Target for Management:** Terms, words, domains, and codes.
*   **Management Functions:**
    *   **Data Standard Management:** Managing words, terms, domains, standard codes, and handling multiple standards.
    *   **Data Structure Management:** Managing ER models, database schemas, variable attributes, history, and model comparisons.
    *   **Process Management:** Managing the registration of standards and models.

#### 4. Defining Data Standards

Steps to create effective data standards:

*   **Deriving Standard Words:**
    *   **Process:** Split all existing terms into individual word units from across information systems. Extract words from entities and attributes.
    *   **Management:** Reorganize homophones (same sound, different meaning) and synonyms (same meaning, different word). Manage words with logical and physical names.
    *   **Dictionary:** The standard word dictionary should define relationships like synonyms and antonyms.
*   **Word Split:**
    *   Breaks collected terms into their basic, meaningful business words.
    *   *Example:* "Resident registration number" → "resident" + "registration" + "number".
*   **Processing Synonyms:**
    *   Selects one representative word as the standard for words with the same meaning.
    *   All final standard words must be unique in both their full name and abbreviation (e.g., in Korean and English).
    *   *Example:* Unify "secret number," "passcode," "password" into "password."
*   **Deriving a Standard Domain Dictionary:**
    *   **Process:** Each attribute must be assigned to *one* specific domain (a set of allowed values for an attribute).
    *   **Registration:** When a new attribute is added, its domain must be selected and registered.
    *   *Example:* (Term) "Resident registration number" → (Domain name) "Registration number" → (Type) "Char(13)".
*   **Deriving a Standard Code Dictionary:**
    *   **Process:** Collect all codes used in the organization, then check and integrate identical codes to define standard codes.
    *   **Usage:** New codes can be defined using these standard codes (e.g., defining a "wrapping paper color" code based on a standard "color code").
*   **Deriving a Standard Term Dictionary:**
    *   **Process:** Combine standard words (extracted from entities and attributes) to create standard terms.
    *   **Reference:** Uses the standard word, domain, and code dictionaries to derive terms for current use.
    *   **Structure:** Typically divided into an entity term dictionary and a property (attribute) term dictionary.
    *   *Example:* (Standard words) "Customer," "classification," "code," "ID" → (Standard terms) "Customer classification code," "Customer ID".

#### 5. Confirming Data Standards

Reviewing data standards ensures their quality and effectiveness.

*   **Targets for Review:** Standard word, domain, code, and term dictionaries.
*   **Major Verification Criteria:**
    *   **Uniqueness:** Each data standard is physically and semantically distinct.
    *   **Completeness:** All necessary inputs for each data standard object are defined.
    *   **Accuracy:** All input items for each data standard target are correctly entered.
    *   **Generality:** The defined data standard can be applied consistently across multiple systems.

### Next Topic Preview: Relational Algebra

This section introduces the foundational theory behind relational databases and SQL.

**Concept:**
Relational algebra is a set of operations used to process relations (tables) in a relational database. The key characteristic is that both the input (operands) and output (results) of these operations are always relations.

**Importance:**
Understanding relational algebra is crucial for efficiently using relational databases via query languages like SQL. Without this theoretical basis, SQL statements may not produce intended results or could lead to poor performance.

**Learning Objectives:**

1.  Explain the concept of relational algebra.
2.  Utilize set operations (e.g., union, intersection) and relation operations (e.g., select, project, join).
3.  Utilize extended relational algebra operations.

**Keywords:**
Relational operation, relational algebra, relational calculus, set operation, relational operation, join, extended relational algebra.
