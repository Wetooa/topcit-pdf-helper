## Network Layer & Routing: Learning Guide

This guide covers the essentials of the network layer, how data is transmitted across networks, and the role of routers.

### 1. Introduction to the Network Layer

*   **Definition:** The third layer in both the **OSI 7-layer model** and **TCP/IP model**.
*   **Purpose:** Responsible for sending **packets** (data units) from a transmitting device to a receiving device across different networks.
*   **Key Role:** Efficient data transmission, generating IP-based packets, and routing them through the Internet.
*   **Devices:** Primarily involves **Routers**.

### 2. How the Network Layer Works: A Scenario

Imagine sending data from your computer (User A) on your local network to a server (`my.server.com`) on a different, remote network.

1.  **Packet Creation:** Data from higher layers (like the Transport Layer's **segments**) is **encapsulated** into an **IP packet** by the Network Layer. This packet contains the destination IP address of `my.server.com`.
2.  **Local Transmission:** Your computer (e.g., IP: 192.168.11.5) cannot directly send the packet to the remote server. It first sends it to its local **gateway router** (e.g., Router B, IP: 192.168.11.1).
    *   To send the packet on the local network, the computer needs the **MAC address** (physical address) of Router B. It finds this (e.g., using **ARP** – Address Resolution Protocol).
    *   The packet is then sent to Router B using its MAC address.
3.  **Router Forwarding:**
    *   Router B receives the packet and inspects its **IP header** (the destination IP address).
    *   It realizes the packet's final destination (`my.server.com`) is not directly connected to its own local networks.
    *   Based on its internal **routing table**, Router B determines the next best path (e.g., to Router C) and forwards the packet.
4.  **Hops to Destination:** The packet travels through several **hops** (routers) across the Internet, each router making a forwarding decision based on its routing table.
5.  **Final Delivery:** The destination server (`my.server.com`) receives the packet, recognizes its own IP address, removes the network layer header, and passes the original data up to its higher layers.

### 3. Network Layer Functions

The network layer performs essential tasks:

*   **Packetizing:**
    *   **Encapsulation:** The transmitting side wraps the data (**payload**) into a packet with network layer headers (like IP address).
    *   **Decapsulation:** The receiving side removes these headers to retrieve the original payload.
    *   Ensures data integrity during transmission.
*   **Routing:**
    *   The process of finding the optimal path (route) for a packet to travel from the source to the destination.
    *   Uses **routing algorithms** to calculate paths.
*   **Forwarding:**
    *   The action a router takes when a packet arrives at one of its interfaces.
    *   The router consults its **routing table** (also called a **forwarding table** or **decision table**) to determine which outgoing interface to send the packet through.

### 4. Internetworking Equipment

**Internetworking** refers to connecting different networks. Various devices operate at different layers:

| Device     | Layer(s) Responsible | Description                                                                          |
| :--------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repeater** | Physical Layer       | Enhances (amplifies or reproduces) signals between connection points.                |
| **Hub**      | Physical Layer       | Basic device that connects multiple network devices, sending data to all ports.      |
| **Bridge**   | Data Link Layer      | Connects two LANs, making them appear as one; interprets and converts data formats. |
| **Switch**   | Data Link Layer      | A multi-port bridge; separates networks based on **MAC addresses**.                  |
| **Router**   | **Network Layer**    | Finds the **optimal communication path** when connecting heterogeneous networks.     |
| **Gateway**  | Application Layer    | Connects networks and translates protocols, often performing router functions too.   |

### 5. What is a Router?

*   **Definition:** A network device that forwards traffic (packets) between different networks and determines the best path based on network layer information (IP addresses) and **metrics**.

#### Router Structure

Routers are typically composed of two main planes:

1.  **Router Control Plane:**
    *   Implemented in software.
    *   **Determines *where*** packets should be sent.
    *   Uses **routing tables** and **routing information bases (RIB)** to make decisions.
    *   Handles routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF, RIP, IGMP/MLD) and management functions (e.g., CLI, SNMP).
2.  **Forwarding Plane:**
    *   Actually ***sends*** the packets according to the decisions made by the control plane.
    *   Uses **forwarding engine abstraction (FEA)** for the physical packet movement.

#### Router Metrics

**Metrics** are data points collected by a router to evaluate the efficiency and desirability of different paths. Routers use these to determine the "optimal" route.

*   **Number of Hops:**
    *   The count of routers a packet must pass through to reach its destination.
    *   Fewer hops generally indicate a faster path.
*   **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):**
    *   The maximum size of a data packet (in bytes) that a protocol can transmit over a network link.
    *   Important for fragmentation and path discovery.
*   **Cost:**
    *   A value derived from factors like transfer time, link reliability, and bandwidth characteristics.
    *   A higher cost typically means a less efficient or desirable path.
*   **Latency:**
    *   Measures the delay encountered by packets (e.g., processing delays, queuing delays) and identifies potential bottlenecks during transfer between routers.

(52) Information  created  by the TCP protocol  is capsulized  in order to be routed to the 220.17.23.0
network,  in which my.server.com  is present,  through  several hops (IP).
An initial packet that contains  the information  for routing between  networks  is created.
However,  it must be further  modified  to be transferred  between  networks.  The IPv4 address  of
user A’s computer  is 192.168.11.5  and cannot  be transmitted  to my.server.com  directly.  It must
be transmitted  to the computer's  gateway  wired/wireless  router B (192.168.11.1).  However,  an
IP address  cannot  be used for data transfer  in a network,  so the MAC address  is needed.  After
finding  the MAC address  that corresponds  to 192.168.11.1,  the gateway’s  IP address,  the packet
is transmitted  to wired/wireless  router B, through  network  broadcasting.
Upon receiving  the packet  from user A’s computer,  wired/wireless  router B, aware that the
packet  is not sent to the router  as the final destination,  examines  to which address  the packet
must be transmitted.  The IP header  indicates  that the packet's  final destination  is my.server.
com, and since it does not belong  to network  192.168.11.0  or 14.32.172.0,  to which wired/
wireless  router  B belongs,  it transmits  the packet  to router  C, to which it belongs.
Upon receiving  the packet, my.server.com  examines  the IP address  and recognizes  that
the packet was sent to it. It removes  the header  data, such as the IP address,  and sends the
remaining  data up to a higher layer.

A) What is a network  layer?
The network  layer is the third layer of the OSI 7 model and TCP/IP and sends packets,  from a transmitting  side, to a
receiving  side. It receives  a segment  from the transmitting  layer, encapsulates  it, and sends it to the datalink  layer.

B) Network  layer function
The transmitting  side of the network  layer performs  payload  encapsulation,  and the receiving  side performs  payload
decapsulation.  The packetizing  function  is responsible  for ensuring  that there is no change  to the payload  during data
transmission.  The routing function  finds a path through  which packets can be delivered.  The forwarding  function is
performed  by a router when a packet arrives through  one interface  on the router. When performing  forwarding,  the
router creates  a decision  table by applying  the routing  rules. The decision  table is also called the forwarding  or routing
table.
