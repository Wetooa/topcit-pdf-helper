### D) Understanding TRIZ

**1. Overview**
*   **Definition:** A systematic methodology for solving invention problems.
*   **Origin:** Developed by Genrich Altshuller in the Soviet Union (1940s) by analyzing 50,000 creative patents.
*   **Four Important Discoveries:**
    1.  Invention problems always involve at least one contradiction.
    2.  There are 5 levels of invention.
    3.  There are 40 principles concerning the type of invention.
    4.  There are 8 rules concerning technology system evolution.

**2. Types of TRIZ Contradictions**
TRIZ classifies contradictions into two main types:

*   **Physical Contradiction:**
    *   **Meaning:** A single variable needs two opposite values at the same time (e.g., an object needs to be both hot and cold).
    *   **Solution:** Mainly solved using the **principle of separation** (in time, space, scale, or condition).
*   **Technical Contradiction:**
    *   **Meaning:** Two variable characteristics conflict with each other (e.g., making a product stronger makes it heavier).
    *   **Solution:** Solved with 40 inventive principles, contradiction matrix, 76 standard solutions, 8 laws of technology evolution, and natural science effects.

**3. Utilization of TRIZ in Business Management**
TRIZ is effective in both engineering and management:
*   **Management Support:** Quickly resolves management difficulties/contradictions, saves time/money, approaches issues from an engineering perspective, avoids compromises, and resolves fundamental problems.
*   **Innovation Support:** Secures innovativeness by resolving fundamental problems.
*   **Thinking Management:** Develops a business management technique where thinking processes are internalized, providing a rational decision-making system.
*   **Fusion Management:** Creates synergies by combining TRIZ with other sectors/techniques.

### E) Understanding SERVQUAL

**1. Overview**
*   **Definition:** A technique to analyze the gap between the service quality *expected* by users and the *actual* service quality provided by an enterprise.
*   **Purpose:** Helps prioritize the relative importance of service attributes (as perceived by the user), allowing enterprises to provide service based on these priorities.
*   **Origin:** Proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry in 1985.

**2. The 5 Dimensions of SERVQUAL**
SERVQUAL is built around five core dimensions:
*   **Tangibles:** Physical facilities, equipment, staff attire, visual appearance of data.
*   **Reliability:** The service company's ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately.
*   **Responsiveness:** The attitude, behavior, and willingness associated with customer response and prompt service provision.
*   **Assurance:** An employee's ability to communicate knowledge, good manners, trust, and confidence.
*   **Empathy:** The attention, effort, and consideration given to customers by a service company.

**Note:** These 5 dimensions can be further subdivided into 10 categories for detailed investigation and evaluation:
1.  Tangibles
2.  Reliability
3.  Responsiveness
4.  Competence
5.  Courtesy
6.  Credibility
7.  Safety
8.  Accessibility
9.  Communication
10. Customer Understanding

*   **Definition:** A management technique that uses statistical data and analysis to repeatedly improve a process and maintain high rates of satisfactory quality production.
*   **Purpose:** Allows enterprises to control the condition of a product during production, conduct engineering analysis of defect causes, and establish the best rectification methods.

**2. Effects of SPC**
*   **Uniform Quality:** Produces goods of uniform quality within a narrow distribution range.
*   **Reduced Variation:** Reduces process variations.
*   **Process Stability:** Stabilizes each process.
*   **Zero-Defect Foundation:** Lays the groundwork for producing zero-defect goods.
*   **Productivity & Profit:** Enhances productivity, leads to significant cost reductions, and contributes to higher profits.

**3. Constituent Elements of SPC**
*   **Deviation:**
    *   **Description:** An attribute indicating product quality; refers to the distribution of values around a central point or its trend.
    *   **Causes:** Occurs due to **common causes** (inherent, normal variation) or **assignable causes** (specific, identifiable issues).
*   **Process Management & Capability:**
    *   **Description:** Managerial ability to reduce deviation.
    *   **Goal:** Keep deviations within allowable product ranges by continuously eliminating common and assignable causes.
*   **Distribution & Statistics:**

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
For the efficient  implementation  of PI, all executives  and employees  of the enterprise  must be familiar  with and share
in the vision of change.  The activities  and resources  needed  for implanting  change  must be organized  and strategies
must be developed.  The CEO must display strong leadership  and active participation.  Leaders  should encourage
the completion  of changes,  take responsibility  for activities,  and encourage  active participation  by the stakeholders.
Leaders  must also turn the management  vision into reality and increase  the ability of individuals  and teams to
perform  their  jobs effectively  in the new environment.
PI can be established  stably only if change management  with PI is successful. An organization's  ability to adapt to
change  will eventually  determine  the success  or failure of the project.
C) Understanding  Six Sigma
@ Overview  of Six Sigma
“Six Sigma’ is a quality innovation  movement  that was started by Motorola  in 1987 with the aim of achieving  a defect
rate of less than three out of one million products  and of reaching  the so-called  “6 Sigma’  level of quality  by analyzing
and quantifying  the causes of inefficiencies  in management.  Thus, the three main pillars of Six Sigma are statistical
measurement,  business  strategy,  and philosophy  (transformation  of the way work should be performed).
@ Characteristics  of Six Sigma
+ The statistical  measurement  of process innovations  is critical. Quantification  and objective  measurements  are
performed.

ESSENCE
@ Six Sigma implementation  methodology
The Six Sigma implementation  methodology  can be separated  into the design program  and the manufacturing
program.  The design program  uses the DMADV  methodology,  while the manufacturing  program  uses the DMAIC
methodology.  Another  characteristic  is that the design program  is focused  on preventing  errors and defects,  whereas
the manufacturing  program  is focused  on reducing  defects  and preventing  recurrences.
<Table  28> Six Sigma implementation  methodology
Program Descriptioni
| + The design program  is for designing  a process  that surpasses  the core requirements  and the customers’
Design program expectations.  The design program is focused on preventing  errors and defects. It is suitable for
(DMADV) developing  new products  or processes,  and for redesigning  existing products or processes.
- (Define)  Establish  the goals of design activities  that satisfy  the requirements  put forth by users.
