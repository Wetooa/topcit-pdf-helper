## Database Normalization & Anomalies Learning Guide

### 1. Database Anomalies (Issues in Poorly Designed Databases)

Anomalies occur in databases not designed with proper attribute relationships and dependencies.

*   **Definition:** Problems arising during data processing (inserting, deleting, updating).
*   **Goal of Normalization:** To prevent these anomalies by structuring tables correctly.

**Types of Anomalies:**

1.  **Insertion Anomaly**
    *   **Definition:** Unintended information is inserted when adding new data.
    *   **Problem:** If you try to add department information without a student, the primary key (Student ID) would be null, violating entity integrity. You're forced to add student info just to add department info.
2.  **Deletion Anomaly**
    *   **Definition:** Necessary information is also deleted when deleting certain data.
    *   **Problem:** If the last student in a department is deleted, the entire department's information (e.g., department office location) might also be lost, even if it's still needed.
3.  **Update Anomaly**
    *   **Definition:** The same content must be updated multiple times across several records when modifying information.
    *   **Problem:** If a department's office location changes, you'd have to update that information for *every student* belonging to that department.

### 2. Functional Dependency (FD) & Rules of Inference

Functional dependency is a crucial concept for decomposing tables to prevent anomalies.

#### A) Functional Dependency (X → Y)

*   **Definition:** If for any two records, having the same value for attribute set X always means they have the same value for attribute set Y, then Y is **functionally dependent** on X.
    *   X is the **determinant**.
    *   Y is the **dependent**.
*   **Expression:** `X → Y` (Y is functionally dependent on X).
*   **Example:** `(Resident registration number) → (Name)` (A given ID determines a single name).

**Types of Functional Dependency (Relevant for Normal Forms):**

*   **Full Functional Dependency (2NF):** An attribute is fully functionally dependent on a composite key if it is dependent on the *entire* key, not just a part of it.
*   **Partial Functional Dependency (2NF):** An attribute is partially dependent on a composite key if it depends on *only a subset* of the key. (This causes 2NF violations).
*   **Transitive Dependency (3NF):** If `A → X` and `X → Y`, then `A → Y`. Y is transitively dependent on A through X. (This causes 3NF violations).
*   **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** Requires that for every functional dependency `X → Y`, X must be a **candidate key**. (Violations occur if a non-candidate key determines another attribute).

#### B) Armstrong's Axioms

These are rules used to infer additional functional dependencies from existing ones.

| Rule                   | Inference          | Contents                                 |
| :--------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Reflexivity Rule**   | If `Y ⊆ X`, then `X → Y`.       | A set of attributes determines any of its subsets. |
| **Augmentation Rule**  | If `X → Y`, then `XZ → YZ`.    | Adding the same attributes to both sides of a dependency maintains it. |
| **Transitivity Rule**  | If `X → Y` and `Y → Z`, then `X → Z`. | If X determines Y, and Y determines Z, then X determines Z. |
| **Union Rule**         | If `X → Y` and `X → Z`, then `X → YZ`. | If X determines Y and X determines Z, then X determines YZ (the union of Y and Z). |
| **Decomposition Rule** | If `X → YZ`, then `X → Y` and `X → Z`. | If X determines Y and Z, then X determines Y, and X determines Z individually. |
| **Pseudo-Transitivity Rule** | If `X → Y` and `WY → Z`, then `XW → Z`. | A combination of augmentation and transitivity. |

### 3. Database Design with Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

Normalization transforms tables into "normal form" tables to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

#### A) Normalization Process Overview

1.  **Irregular Relation** (Un-normalized)
2.  **1st Normal Form (1NF):** Decompose non-atomic domains.
3.  **2nd Normal Form (2NF):** Remove partial functional dependency.
4.  **3rd Normal Form (3NF):** Remove transitive functional dependency.
5.  **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):** Remove functional dependency where the determinant is not a candidate key.

#### B) Examples of Normalization

**1) First Normal Form (1NF)**

*   **Problem:** Attributes contain non-atomic values (multiple values in a single cell).
    *   *Example:* A "Courses" field listing "Database, Operating System" for one student.
*   **Rule:** Each attribute must contain only atomic (single, indivisible) values.
*   **Solution:** Decompose the attribute into separate rows or create a composite key.
    *   *Example:* Split the student record into multiple rows, one for each course. If `Student ID` was the original key, the new primary key becomes `(Student ID, Course Name)`.

**2) Second Normal Form (2NF)**

*   **Prerequisite:** Must be in 1NF.
*   **Problem:** Partial functional dependency exists (a non-key attribute depends on only *part* of a composite primary key).
    *   *Example:* In a table with primary key `(Student ID, Course Code)`, if `Course Code → Course Name`. Here, `Course Name` depends only on `Course Code`, not the full `(Student ID, Course Code)` key.
*   **Rule:** All non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the *entire* primary key.
*   **Solution:** Split the table into two or more tables to remove partial dependencies.
    *   *Example:* Create a `Student Grades` table `(Student ID, Course Code, Grade)` and a `Course Details` table `(Course Code, Course Name)`.

**3) Third Normal Form (3NF)**

*   **Prerequisite:** Must be in 2NF.
*   **Problem:** Transitive functional dependency exists (a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute).
    *   *Example:* In a `Student` table with `Student ID` as primary key, if `Student ID → Department` and `Department → Department Office`. Here, `Department Office` transitively depends on `Student ID` via `Department`.
*   **Rule:** There must be no transitive dependencies of non-key attributes on the primary key.
*   **Solution:** Split the table into two or more tables to remove transitive dependencies.
    *   *Example:* Create a `Student Department` table `(Student ID, Name, Department)` and a `Department Office` table `(Department, Department Office)`.

**4) Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

*   **Prerequisite:** Must be in 3NF.
*   **Problem:** A determinant (attribute or set of attributes that determines another attribute) is *not* a candidate key. This often occurs when there are overlapping composite candidate keys.
    *   *Example:* In a table with `(Professor, Course Name, Textbook Name)`, assume `(Professor, Course Name) → Textbook Name` and `Textbook Name → Course Name`. `Textbook Name` determines `Course Name`, but `Textbook Name` is not a candidate key for the original table.
*   **Rule:** For every non-trivial functional dependency `X → Y`, `X` must be a **candidate key**.
*   **Solution:** Decompose the table to ensure all determinants are candidate keys.
    *   *Example:* Split into `(Professor, Textbook Name)` and `(Textbook Name, Course Name)`.

---

### 4. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

#### A) Concept

*   **Goal:** Removes **multi-valued dependencies (MVDs)** when more than two occur in a relation.
*   MVDs exist when an attribute in a table can have multiple values for a single value of another attribute, and these multiple values are independent of other attributes in the table.

#### B) Characteristics

*   **Semantic Association Constraint:** 4NF is applicable when there's a meaningful relationship between attributes.
*   **Primary Identifiers:** Established when all attributes are part of the primary key.
*   **Three or More Attributes:** MVDs typically arise when there are three or more associated attributes.
*   **Semantic Association:** Focuses on normalization based on semantic relationships, not just functional dependencies.
*   **Independent Relationships:** If attributes A, B, and C exist:
    *   A and B are related.
    *   A and C are related.
    *   C and B are *not* related. (This independence can cause MVD issues if all are in one table).

01 Normalization  and Anomalies
Various anomalies  can occur when performing  data processing  operations  in a database  that has been poorly
designed  without  strictly considering  the relationship  between  data attributes,  particularly  dependencies  between
attributes.  Representative  anomalies  include an insertion  anomaly,  deletion  anomaly,  and update anomaly.  These
anomalies  are explained  in <Table 25>.
<Table 25> Table showing  mixed student  information  and department  information  (primary  key = “student  ID”)
Student  ID Name Gender Department  name Department  office
1111 Hong Gildong Male Computer  engineering Engineering  building
2222 Ryu Gwansun Female Computer  engineering Engineering  building
. Natural  science3333 Gang Gamchan Male Physics building
A) Insertion  anomaly
@ Definition:  An anomaly  in which unintended  information  is also inserted  when inserting  certain information.
(Example)  When inserting  the information  (Department  name = “Management  information’,  Department  office =
“Management  Building’)  into the table in <Table 25>.
+ Entity integrity  is lost if only the department  name and department  office values are inserted,  because  the primary
key (“Student  ID”) becomes  null.
+ To maintain  entity integrity,  the department  name and department  office information  must be inserted  together
with the student  ID of the student  belonging  to the Department  of Management  Information  Technology.
B) Deletion  anomaly
@ Definition:  An anomaly  in which necessary  information  is also deleted  when deleting  certain information.
(Example)  When deleting  the information  of (Student  ID="3333’)  in <Table 25>.
+ If this student  is the only student  belonging  to the “Physics  Department’,  the information  that the department
office of the “Physics  Department’  is in the “Natural  Science  Building’  is also deleted.
C) Update  anomaly
@  Definition:  An anomaly  in which the same content  should be updated  for several data repeatedly  when modifying
certain information.
(Example)  When the office of the “Department  of Computer  Science and Engineering”  is changed  to the “Future
Building’  in <Table 25>.
+ Modification  operations  should be performed  as many times as the number  of students  belonging  to the “Department
of Computer  Engineering”.

O2 Concept  of Functional  Dependency  and Rule of Inference
The anomalies  described above can be prevented  by decomposing  each table based on specific  criteria. Functional
dependency  is one of the most useful criteria that can be applied when decomposing  a table in this way and is
expressed  as the relationship  between  a determinant  and a dependent.  Additional  functional  dependency  can be
inferred  based on the previously  discovered  functional  dependency.  At this time, Armstrong’s  Axioms  are used.
A) Functional  dependency
@ Definition:  There are the subsets X and Y of the field defined in the table R. At this time, if the values of X of the
arbitrary  record pair t1 and t2 are the same, and the Y values of those two records  are always the same, Y is functionally
dependent  on X.
@ Expression:  X >Y (Dependent  Y is functionally  dependent  on determinant  X.)
+ (Example)  (Resident  registration  number)  — (Name)
+ If the resident  registration  numbers  of two records  are the same in the table about people, it means  that the names
of these two records  are always the same.
