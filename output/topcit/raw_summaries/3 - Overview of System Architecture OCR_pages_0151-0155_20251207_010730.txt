# Data Link Layer: Addressing and Error Control

## 1. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP is used to find a MAC address when only the IP address is known.

### ARP Packet Structure
An ARP packet is structured with various fields, including:
*   **Destination MAC Address:** 6 bytes
*   **Source MAC Address:** 6 bytes
*   **Ethernet Protocol Type:** 2 bytes
*   **Hardware Type:** 2 bytes
*   **Protocol Type:** 2 bytes
*   **Hardware Address Length:** 1 byte
*   **Protocol Address Length:** 1 byte
*   **Operation Code:** 2 bytes
*   **Sender Hardware Address:** 6 bytes
*   **Sender Protocol Address (IP):** 4 bytes
*   **Target Hardware Address:** 6 bytes
*   **Target Protocol Address (IP):** 4 bytes
*   **Padding:** 18 bytes

### MAC Address Search Scenario (How ARP Works)
1.  **Need for MAC:** If two devices (e.g., computer A and Router C) are on the same network and need to communicate, computer A needs Router C's MAC address.
2.  **ARP Request (Broadcast):** Computer A sends an ARP request packet, broadcast to all systems in its network segment.
3.  **ARP Reply (Unicast):** Router C, recognizing its IP address, unicasts (sends directly) its MAC address back to computer A in an ARP reply.
4.  **Caching:** Both systems store the MAC address in their cache memory for future use. Network devices like routers also store a port-MAC address table.

## 2. Datalink Layer Error Control

Errors can occur during data transmission over the data link layer. Error control detects and corrects these errors.

### A) Concept of Error Control

*   **Types of Errors:**
    *   **Single-bit error:** Only one bit changes.
    *   **Multi-bit error:** Two or more non-contiguous bits change.
    *   **Burst error:** Two or more consecutive bits change.
*   **Error Control Function:** Detects and corrects errors when transmitted data is corrupted.
*   **Error Control Methods:**
    *   **Forward Error Correction (FEC):** Receiver detects errors and recovers by itself, using extra error recovery bits transmitted with the data.
    *   **Backward Error Correction (BEC):** Receiver notifies the transmitting device about an error, requesting retransmission of the corrupted data.

### B) Error Detection

Error detection uses **redundancy** (adding spare bits) to allow the receiver to identify errors.

*   **Error Detection Methods:**
    *   **VRC (Vertical Redundancy Check):** Widely used, includes **parity check** (adding a bit to make the total number of 1s even or odd).
    *   **LRC (Longitudinal Redundancy Check):** Collects the even parity of all bytes in a data unit and adds it to the end of the data block.
    *   **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** A powerful detection method using binary division.
    *   **Checksum:** Used by higher-level protocols, also based on redundancy.

### C) Error Correction

Error correction involves either the receiver requesting retransmission or automatically correcting the error using specific codes.

*   **Self-Correction Methods (using error correction codes):**
    *   **Single-bit error correction:** Locates and corrects the wrong bit, often using **parity bits**. (e.g., ASCII code might require 3-bit redundancy).
    *   **Redundant bit error correction:** Calculates required redundant bits based on the number of data bits to correct errors.
    *   **Hamming code:** A specific method used to find the redundant bit position for error correction.
    *   **Multi-bit error correction:** Uses redundant bits calculated by overlapping data bits to correct multiple errors.

*   **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ):**
    An algorithm where the receiver informs the sender of an error, and the sender retransmits the corrupted frame.
    *   **ARQ Types:**
        *   **Stop-and-wait ARQ:** Sender transmits one frame, then waits for an ACK (acknowledgment) or NACK (negative acknowledgment) before sending the next. Simple but inefficient.
        *   **Go-back-N ARQ:** Sender continuously transmits multiple frames within a "window size." If an error is detected, the receiver sends a NACK, and the sender retransmits *all* frames starting from the error point. More efficient than Stop-and-wait.
        *   **Selective-repeat ARQ:** Similar to Go-back-N, but only the *specifically corrupted* frame is retransmitted. Requires larger transmission and receipt buffers.
        *   **Adaptive ARQ:** Detects the communication line's error rate and dynamically adjusts the frame length for optimal transmission.
        *   **Hybrid-ARQ (H-ARQ):** Combines FEC and BEC. FEC is performed normally to maintain network efficiency, and BEC is used for retransmission when FEC fails, improving reliability.

[Figure 108] ARP packet structure
The ARP packet is organized  of the 6-byte destination  MAC address,  6-byte source MAC address,  2-byte Ethernet
protocol  type, 2-byte hardware  type, 2-byte protocol  type, 1-byte hardware  address  length, 1-byte protocol  address
length, 2-byte operation  code, 6-byte sender hardware  address,  4-byte sender  protocol  address,  6-byte target
hardware  address,  4-byte  target protocol  address,  and 18-byte  padding.
B) MAC address  search scenario
Since Router  C and computer  with user A are in the same network  section,  with user A, as shown in [Figure 103], the
MAC address  is required  for communication.  In that case, the computer  with user A sends an ARP request  through
broadcasting  to all systems  in the network  section. The data section of the frame, transferred  through the ARP
request,  contains  the ARP packet, as shown in [Figure 108]. On receiving  the response,  router C transfers  its MAC
address  in the ARP packet  to the computer  with user A through  unicast,  to find each other's  MAC address.  The MAC
address  is stored in each system's  cache memory.  In that case, wired/wireless  router B stores the port-MAC  address
table of the system  connected  to its cache memory  ports.
05 Techniques  of Datalink  Layer error Detection  and Correction
A) Concept  of error control
Transferring  frames through  the data link layer can cause various  errors, depending  on the network  condition  or the
operation  of the transmitting  and receiving  device. Types of errors include single-bit  errors, in which only one bit of
the data part is changed,  multi-bit  errors, in which two or more non-contiguous  bits are changed  in the data unit, and
burst errors, in which two or more consecutive  bits are changed.
Error control is the function  of detecting  and correcting  errors when transmitted  data does not arrive properly,  or
when an error occurs during transmission.  Error control methods  can be divided into two types, as shown in [Figure

109]. Forward error correction  (FEC) allows the receiving  device to detect errors and recover  from them by itself,
by transmitting  a spare bit for error recovery  in the packet. Backward  error correction  (BEC) notifies  an error to the
transmitting  device  to recover  from the error, when an error occurs  during the data transmission.

@ Error correction
Error correction  methods  include a method in which the receiving  device requests  the sending  device to retransmit
the entire data, or the receiving  device  automatically  performs  a correction  using an error correction  code.
