## Learning Guide: IT Business Performance Evaluation & Ethics

### 1. Introduction to IT Business Performance Evaluation

*   **Purpose:** To review IT's contribution to enterprise growth.
*   **Evolution:**
    *   **Past:** Focused primarily on **financial aspects** (easy to quantify).
    *   **Present:** Expanded to a **comprehensive evaluation** covering:
        *   **Financial aspects**
        *   **Non-financial aspects:** Corporate image enhancement, employee morale/satisfaction.
*   **Key Challenge:** Aligning individual performance goals with enterprise performance goals. This requires effective communication.

### 2. Overview of IT Business Performance Evaluation Techniques

Effective IT business performance evaluation ensures IT investments align with business strategy and provides feedback. The main techniques are:

1.  **Financial Performance Evaluation:** Focuses on quantitative financial benefits.
2.  **Balanced Scorecard (BSC) Assessment:** Complements financial evaluation by adding qualitative and non-financial perspectives.

*   **Key Tools:**
    *   **Key Performance Indicators (KPI):** Measures the level of goal attainment.
    *   **Management by Objectives (MBO):** System for setting objective levels for employee skill development.

### 3. Financial Performance Evaluation Technique

**A. Overview**

*   **Nature:** Traditional, quantitative, uses "currency" as a common unit. Also called "quantitative performance evaluations."
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Shareholders and managers prioritize financial results.
    *   Provides a quick understanding of the management situation.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Result-oriented:** Tends to ignore the process of achieving results.
    *   **Low employee motivation:** Not a great booster for morale due to its abstract nature.
    *   **Abstract figures:** Difficult to convey meaning accurately to all organizational members.

**B. Types of Financial Performance Evaluation Techniques**

These techniques assess financial performance over a specific period or at a specific point in time.

| Technique                 | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ROI** (Return on Investment) | Ratio of net effect to total cost. Used to assess investment feasibility. Does *not* estimate payback time. |
| **NPV** (Net Present Value)   | Relationship between cost and effect of present value, considering discount rate. Reflects future net profits and monetary value over time. Risks should be considered separately. |
| **IRR** (Internal Rate of Return) | Revenues from investments against cash flows. Expresses expected annual revenues to judge risk reduction. Does *not* consider investment size or payback period. |
| **PP** (Payback Period)       | Time taken for cumulative effect to exceed cumulative cost and reach the break-even point. Shows when revenue is generated, *not* how much. |

### 4. Balanced Scorecard (BSC) Technique

**A. Overview of the BSC Technique**

*   **Definition:** A balanced performance evaluation technique that assesses both financial and non-financial performances.
*   **Origin:** Introduced in 1992 by Harvard Business School Professor Robert Kaplan and consultant David Norton.
*   **Why BSC?**
    *   Traditional systems focused too much on financial indicators, making systematic strategy execution difficult.
    *   Necessity to consider non-financial evaluations.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Maintains a balance between indicators.
    *   Concretizes and links strategies.
    *   Improves communication within the organization.

**B. Characteristics of BSC**

*   **Balance Between Indicators:**
    *   Considers multiple perspectives (beyond just financial).
    *   Balances short-term vs. long-term views.
    *   Balances leading (predictive) vs. trailing (historical) indicators.
*   **Concreteness of Strategy:**
    *   Secures strategy clarity through **KPIs**.
    *   Aims for company-wide optimization, not just partial.
    *   Aligns feasible strategies with correct business directions.
*   **Connectivity of Strategy:**
    *   Establishes **causal relationships** between strategies.
    *   Links core strategies after focused selection.
*   **Internal Communication Tool:**
    *   Builds executive capability using detailed KPIs.
    *   Serves as a common language across the organization.

**C. Component Elements of BSC**

BSC evaluates performance from four perspectives and includes elements to manage and achieve enterprise goals.

| Component Element  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perspective**    | The four core viewpoints: Financial, Customer, Process, Learning & Growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **CSF**            | **Critical Success Factors:** Factors absolutely essential for successfully realizing an enterprise's vision and strategy.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Strategy Map**   | A visual tool showing the **causal relationships** among CSFs. It illustrates how an organization creates value by linking initiatives across the four perspectives.                                                                                                                                   |
| **KPI**            | **Key Performance Indicator:** A quantifiable measure to track the progress and success level of a CSF (and thus, a strategy).                                                                                                                                                                          |

**D. Four Perspectives of BSC**

The BSC manages both financial and non-financial views, with the four perspectives being organically interconnected:

1.  **Financial Perspective:** How do we look to shareholders? (e.g., profitability, revenue growth, cost reduction).
2.  **Customer Perspective:** How do customers see us? (e.g., customer satisfaction, market share, customer retention).
3.  **Process Perspective:** What must we excel at? (e.g., operational efficiency, quality, innovation, timely delivery).
4.  **Learning & Growth Perspective:** How can we sustain our ability to change and improve? (e.g., employee skills, IT capabilities, organizational culture, innovation capacity).

*   **Interconnection Example:** Improving employee skills (Learning & Growth) leads to better product quality and production efficiency (Process), which increases customer satisfaction (Customer), ultimately resulting in improved financial performance (Financial).

>> Recent  trends and key issues
The IT business  performance  evaluation  is a procedure  for reviewing  how IT has contributed  to the growth
of an enterprise.  In the past, IT business  performance  evaluations  were mainly performed  on the financial
aspects  of a business.  This made it easy to quantify  the results of IT's contribution to  the earnings  of an
enterprise  and its affiliated  organizations.  However,  this type of evaluation  failed to cover all aspects  of how
IT business  could contribute  in the aforementioned  regard.
In recent years, enterprises  have been expanding  the scope of their IT business  performance  evaluations
with the aim of creating  a more comprehensive  evaluation.  Current  evaluations  cover not only financial
aspects,  but also non-financial  areas such as efforts to enhance  the corporate  image or raise employees’
morale  or satisfaction  with their work.
When evaluating  the performance  of IT business,  one particularly  important  consideration  is the degree to
which enterprises  can align individual  performance  goals with the enterprise’s  performance  goals. To this
end, communication  among employees  is of paramount  importance,  and enterprises  must utilize various
techniques  for bringing  into alignment  top-down  goal setting and bottom-up  goal setting  when they
operate  their businesses
>> Learning  Objectives
1. To be able to explain  the various  types and methods  of IT business  performance  evaluation.
>> Keywords:
Financial  performance  evaluations,  BSC, IT-BSC, KPI, MBO.

ESSENCE
+ Preview  for practical  business
With the aim of improving  the quality of patent administration  and laying the
foundations  for customer-oriented  administrative  services,  the Korean Intellectual
Property  Office (KIPO) declared  its core vision of ‘Promoting  Technology  Innovation
Korean  Intellectual  and Establishing  an Environment  Conducive  to Innovation  by Effectively  Protecting
Property  Office nq Promoting  the Use of Intellectual  Property’ and its mission of  ‘Becoming  an
Intellectual  Property  Powerhouse  through  the Innovation  of Patent  Administration’.  Based on this vision and
mission statement,  the patent office developed  five strategic  objectives,  taking into account  the unique
nature of public institutions  and the two conflicting  interests  of public benefit and financial  profit. In 2005,
the patent  office created  the BSC system,  which links the performance  targets  of individual  employees  to
the five strategic  objectives  of KIPO.
The Korean Intellectual  Property  Office developed  the BSC system in three phases, as follows. In the Ist
phase (second  half of 2004), KIPO established  the performance  management  model for each department.
It also established  its mission,  vision, and strategic  goals, and then derived  the key success  factors  (19) and
the key performance  indicators  (32) for realizing  those goals.
Thus the strategic  framework  of the office was completed  by November  26, 2004. Based on this strategic
framework,  and in alignment  with its strategic  goals, the office announced  the performance  goals, key
success  factors  and key performance  indicators  that each department/bureau  must pursue,  on December
21, 2004. These factors  and indicators  were the core areas of the one-year  job performance  agreements
signed between  the commissioner  and the bureau/department  heads, and between  the bureau/department
heads and the team managers,  on December  28, 2004.
In the 2nd phase (first half of 2005), the organization-level  BSC design was followed  by the individual-level
performance  management  model design. The organizational  performance  indicators were distributed  to
individual  employees,  who were asked to align organization-level  performance  with individual  performance
by reflecting  the organization's  performance  score in the individual  performance  score. By April 30, 2005, an
individual  performance  and competency  evaluation  system had been established  through  which employees
could be motivated  to meet their job goals. At the same time, as part of its effort to introduce  a more
performance-centered  HR policy, the office announced  a new plan in which the result of each individual
employee's  performance  evaluation  would be more closely  linked to the compensation  system.
In the 3rd phase, deployment  of the information  system began on April 1, 2005, and was completed  by the
end of June. Concurrently,  the information  system construction  work was carried out from April 1, 2005 and
completed  at the end of June. The performance  management  system was implemented  using the best
solution  so as to enable the office to manage  performance  as a whole. A strategic  operational  system was
also put in place to monitor  the ex...
