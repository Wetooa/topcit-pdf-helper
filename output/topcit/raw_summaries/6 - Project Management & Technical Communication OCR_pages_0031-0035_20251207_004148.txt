## Learning Guide: Effective Business Communication & Document Writing

### Introduction: The Importance of Effective Business Communication

*   **Core Lesson from Employee P's Story**: Always understand your **ultimate recipient** (e.g., CEO, final decision-maker) when creating documents, even if you report to someone else. Anticipate their questions and tailor your report for *their* understanding, not just your immediate manager's.
*   **Why it Matters**: In business, especially IT, communication is fundamental. Good communication skills are crucial for defining problems, finding solutions, and documenting information effectively.

### Section 2: Principles of Writing Business Documents

#### 2.1 Understand Your Audience (End Consumer)
*   Write from the perspective of the reader or final decision-maker, not your own.
*   Consider their knowledge level, experience, and needs.
*   Tailor the document specifically for different targets (e.g., management vs. general staff).

#### 2.2 Be Concise and Clear
*   Business readers have limited time. Get straight to the point.
*   Present the **conclusion first** to allow for quick understanding of key points.

#### 2.3 Provide Clear Evidence
*   Base your document on accurate information and facts.
*   Avoid vague guesses.
*   Clearly state regulations, policies, and data sources.

#### 2.4 Write Logically
*   Structure your document clearly.
*   Logically explain:
    *   Why it's needed (Purpose, Background)
    *   What the current situation is
    *   What caused it
    *   What are the alternatives/solutions

### Section 3: Methods for Writing Effective Business Documents (Focus on One-Page Reports)

The "one-page report" is a widely used and adaptable format for various business documents.

#### 3.1 Key Message First, Details Attached
*   Summarize your core message or key opinions on the **first page**.
*   Attach supplementary explanations or supporting data as separate documents.
*   **Benefits**: Saves time for reviewers, reduces time spent creating lengthy initial reports.

#### 3.2 Structure with a Table of Contents & Keywords

1.  **Create a Table of Contents (TOC) First**: Don't skip this step. Brainstorm and organize your content logically.
    *   **Example TOC Order**: Purpose, Current Status/Issue, Direction/Improvement Plan, Budget, Decision-Making.
2.  **Use the 5W2HIT Principle for TOC Design**: A common framework for report content.
    *   **Why**: Reason, significance, background of the project.
    *   **What**: Content of the plan.
    *   **Target**: Goals, subject, target of planning.
    *   **How**: Method, means of promotion.
    *   **When**: Time and period of implementation/schedule.
    *   **Who**: Executioner, concerned person.
    *   **Where**: Target area, place.
    *   **How much**: Costs and benefits, budget, profit plan.
3.  **Condense Content to Keywords**:
    *   After drafting, summarize all details using only keywords.
    *   Remove elaborate or flowery language.
    *   **Example**: "It's a very wonderful and beautiful night." becomes "Beautiful night."
    *   **Example**: "Company XX spent a lot of money and did not achieve what it wanted..." becomes "Company XX failed to achieve its goals despite excessive spending."

#### 3.3 Clarify Your Conclusion
*   Poor reports often describe problems without clear solutions.
*   **Always clarify your thesis and conclusions.**
*   Specifically answer "How are you going to do it?" for managers/stakeholders.

#### 3.4 Use Tables Effectively
*   Tables are excellent for summarizing large amounts of information on one page.
*   Combine narrative sentences with tables for optimal clarity and conciseness.

#### 3.5 Write Strong Titles
*   **Purpose**: Allows readers (especially busy executives) to immediately grasp the content, purpose, and nature of the report.
*   **Guidelines**:
    *   **Concise**: Ideally under 20 characters.
    *   **Specific**: Include year, nature of the document.
    *   **Action-Oriented Keywords**: Use words like "review," "improvement (proposal)," "status," "minutes."
    *   **Subtitles**: Use punctuation (-, ()) for longer titles to add specific detail.
*   **Example (Well-written)**: "2009 Evaluation System Improvement Plan (Focusing on Improvement of Performance Evaluation System)"
*   **Example (Poorly written)**: "Evaluation/Compensation System Improvement Plan"

#### 3.6 Include Date and Author (Organizer)
*   Place at the bottom right of the title.
*   **Importance**: Helps identify the document later and prevents confusion with older versions.

#### 3.7 Use Consistent Numbering
*   **Prioritize**: Use your organization's established numbering method.
*   **If no standard**: Choose a common, logical system.
*   **Common Methods**:
    *   Numbers for main headings, letters/figures for subheadings (e.g., 1. a. i. (1)).
    *   Numbers for all levels (e.g., 1. 1.1. 1.1.1.).
    *   Note: Specific code formulas are used for regulations/policies, while mixed numbers/letters are common for official letters/poems.

+ Preview  for practical business
Employee  P met a very tough manager  on his first project.  The manager  rarely approved  a report
from not just Employee  P, but anyone  else. The manager  would quibble  about “Why is this like
this?”, “What evidence  is this supported  by?” Or yell "Why is it so complicated?",  "What  on earth are
you doing?"
Of course, reports  written by Employee  P would always be marked  with the color red meaning  errors.
Employee  P, who was wondering  “Do | lack skills?” or “What is the problem?”  got to realize, “Oh, |
didn't think that the ultimate recipient  of my report was the CEO, not my manager!’  In other words,
he realized  that the final reporter  of the report made by Mr. P was not himself,  but his manager.
From then on, Employee  P set the standards  for making reports like this. He first thought,  "How
much does the CEO know?" and "Will the manager  be able to understand  this document  easily?”,  and
he started creating  the document,  imagining  the manager  reporting  to the CEO. In particular,  when
reporting  to the manager,  he prepared  the grounds  or materials  for the questions  the CEO would be
curious about. In other words, keeping in mind thought  that the CEO is not an expert in the field,
he picked out the questions  that those with general knowledge  might ask and the corresponding
answers,  and submitted  them with the report to the manager.  Since then, Employee  P received
compliment  and better evaluation  on his work.
In IT business  practice,  communication  means the beginning  and end. Define business
communication,  find out techniques  to solve business  problems,  and how to write documents
necessary  for business  communication.

01 Concept  and Types of Business  Documents
A) Concept  of business  documents
Business  documents  refer to all types of documents  necessary  for business  activities  such as process  planning
documents,  business  reports, meeting  minutes,  results and status reports. Unlike general documents,  these
business  documents  must be accurately  described  in a standardized  form so that they are not misleading.  In
addition,  it should be written with concise phrases  and objective expressions, excluding  lengthy phrases  and
emotional  expressions,  so that the person  who receives  the report can understand  it intuitively.
B) Types of business  documents
@ Types of Business  Documents
The types of business  documents  vary according  to the content  of work as follows,  and reports,  proposals,  and
business  plans are used the most.
+ Report: A document  to be prepared  for reporting  on the business  feasibility  of a product  or idea or business
environment  related  to it.
+ Letter: A document  used to evaluate  the value of a product  or idea
+ Proposal:  A document  to obtain approval  for business  promotion  of a product  or idea
+ Plan: A document  to prepare  a commercialization  plan after approval  of a product  or idea
+ Manual:  A document  explaining  the details of the plan/product
@ Types of Report
A report refers to a document  to logically  explain or persuade  a business  plan and progress.  Depending  on the
nature of the report, the report can be divided into a report that describes  the situation  and a report that
seeks judgment.  The former  develops  an idea based on the 5WIH principle  from an  objective  standpoint,  and
prioritizes  speed and accuracy  (e.g,, status report, situation  report, etc.) In the latter case, it is important  to
develop  an idea according  to a logical table of contents  from the perspective  of the person being reported  to,
and to clearly present  the logic and reason (e.g., plan report, countermeasure  report, etc.).
In addition,  it can be classified  according  to the purpose.  Reports made during the planning  process,  such
as planning  reports, are called information  reports, and reports made during the control process,  such as
inspection  results reports,  are called management  reports.
02 Principles  of Writing  Business  Documents
@ Easy to understand  from the perspective  of the end consumer
When creating  a business  document,  make it understandable  and relatable,  not from your own standpoint,  but
from the standpoint  of the reader or final decision  maker. Documents  should be prepared in a way that the
end-user  can understand  and relate to it by comprehensively  considering  the knowledge  level, experience,  and
needs of the end-user.  The end consumer  may be the management  or the ordinary  member  of an organization.
