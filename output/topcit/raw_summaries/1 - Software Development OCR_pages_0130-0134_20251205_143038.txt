## Open-Source Software (OSS) & License Management: A Study Guide

### 1. The Growing Importance of Open-Source Software (OSS)

#### 1.1 Modern Software Development Trends
*   **Focus:** Rapid software development and release ("time to service") is crucial for competitiveness.
*   **Challenge:** Traditional proprietary software development can be too slow.
*   **Solution:** Open-source software (OSS) enables faster development due to its flexible nature and access to various technologies.

#### 1.2 Why OSS is Pervasive
*   OSS use is increasing, especially in new technologies like IoT, AI, Big Data, and Cloud computing.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduces development time and cost.
    *   Helps break technological dependence on single vendors.

#### 1.3 The Critical Need for OSS License Management
*   As OSS use grows, so does the risk of license disputes.
*   **Consequences of non-compliance:**
    *   Damage to corporate image.
    *   Significant financial losses.
    *   Legal responsibility for copyright infringement.
*   **Challenge:** Many perceive OSS as "free," leading to insufficient management. There are over 2,000 types of OSS licenses, adding complexity.
*   **Statistics:** A 2016 NIPA survey found 37% of domestic SMEs violated OSS licenses.
*   **Solution:** Establish robust OSS license management systems, including governance, license analytics, and verification tools.

#### 1.4 Case Study: Hangul and Computer vs. Artifex
*   **Incident:** South Korean software company Hangul and Computer (H&C) was sued by U.S. company Artifex for copyright breach.
*   **Violation:** H&C sold "Hangeul" programs that included "Ghostscript" (a PDF conversion library) developed and distributed by Artifex under a GPL (General Public License). H&C violated the GPL terms.
*   **Outcome:** H&C's dismissal request was rejected, and they had to pay a settlement.
*   **Lesson:** This case highlights the serious financial and reputational risks of unauthorized GPL code use and the importance of compliance.

### 2. Understanding Open-Source Software (OSS)

#### 2.1 Definition of OSS
*   **Open-Source Software (OSS):** Software that can be freely used, copied, and modified by anyone, while still protecting the creator's rights.
*   **Core Idea:** The source code must be shared for joint research and collaboration to make the software "better."

#### 2.2 History and Key Organizations
*   **1980s:** Restrictions on software use based on intellectual property rights emerged.
*   **Free Software Movement:**
    *   **Richard Stallman** founded the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** to protect users' freedom to use software. This movement is the origin of OSS.
    *   "Free software" emphasizes user freedom.
*   **Open Source Initiative (OSI):**
    *   Formed in 1998, popularized the term "open-source software."
    *   Manages the promotion and certification of OSS.
    *   Defines the **Open Source Definition (OSD)**, a minimum standard for OSS licenses.
    *   Awards an OSI certification mark to compliant OSS.

#### 2.3 Examples of OSS
*   **Server Software:** Apache web server, PHP, MySQL, Hadoop, Openstack
*   **Development Tools:** Eclipse, gdb
*   **Operating Systems:** Linux

### 3. Understanding Open-Source Software Licenses

#### 3.1 Definition of OSS Licenses
*   **OSS License:** An agreement between an open-source developer and a user, outlining how the software can be used and under what conditions.
*   **Purpose:** To protect the creator's rights and establish conditions for use, often mandating source code disclosure under specific circumstances.

#### 3.2 Scope of License Application
*   **Crucial Point:** Obligations under an OSS license typically apply **only when the software is distributed or sold externally.**
*   **Internal Use:** Generally, there are **no obligations** when OSS is used solely within an organization.

#### 3.3 Common Characteristics of OSS Licenses
*   Free use
*   Distribution without significant restrictions (though conditions apply)
*   Ability to acquire source code
*   Ability to modify source code

#### 3.4 Key Differences Among Licenses
*   **Primary distinctions:**
    *   Obligation to disclose "secondary works" (modifications or combined software).
    *   Rules for combining OSS with proprietary (closed-source) software.

### 4. Key Open-Source Software Licenses: A Comparison

Licenses vary in their "stringency" or permissiveness regarding source code disclosure and combination with proprietary software.

#### 4.1 GPL (GNU General Public License)
*   **Stringency:** The most stringent (strict) license, known for its "viral" nature.
*   **Core Condition:** If GPL-licensed code is combined with proprietary software and distributed, the **entire combined program (including the proprietary parts) must also be opened under the GPL.**
*   **GPL 2.0 (Frequently Adopted):**
    *   **Distribution:** Must include copyright notice, state distribution under GPL, and declare absence of warranty.
    *   **Modifications/Linking:** If you modify GPL software or link new software (static or dynamic) with GPL code, **all source code must be opened under the GPL.**
    *   **Royalties:** Cannot receive royalties for patented programs used under the GPL.
*   **GPL 3.0 (Supplemented Version):**
    *   Similar to 2.0, but addresses Digital Rights Management (DRM), software patents, and compatibility.
    *   **Installation Info:** If GPL 3.0 code is included in a product, installation information must be provided with the source code.
    *   **DRM:** Waives DRM interests protected by national laws.
    *   **Patents:** Contributors must provide a non-discriminatory, fee-free patent license for their contributions.

#### 4.2 LGPL (Lesser General Public License)
*   **Stringency:** More permissive than GPL, specifically designed to encourage commercial software developers to use open-source libraries.
*   **Key Difference from GPL:** When an application program links (static or dynamic) with an LGPL library, developers **do not** have to open the source code of the application program itself.
*   **Patent Handling:** Same as GPL.

#### 4.3 BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) License
*   **Stringency:** Very permissive.
*   **Key Feature:** **Does NOT require disclosure of the software source code, even for modifications.**
*   **Reason for Permissiveness:** Often used for projects funded by government resources (e.g., U.S. taxes), implying public ownership.
*   **Obligations:**
    *   **Distribution:** Must specify copyright notice and absence of warranty.
    *   **Commercial Use:** Can be used for commercial software without limitations, as there's no obligation to disclose modified source code.

#### 4.4 Apache License
*   **Stringency:** Similar to BSD in permissiveness.
*   **Application:** Used for all software by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), like the Apache web server.
*   **Key Feature:** **Does NOT require disclosure of the software source code, even for modifications.**
*   **Obligations:**
    *   **Trademark:** Do not violate the "Apache" trademark right.
    *   **Distribution:** Must specify copyright notice and absence of warranty.
    *   **Compatibility:** Can be combined with code distributed under GPL 3.0.
    *   **Commercial Use:** Can be used for commercial software without limitations (no obligation to disclose modified program source code).

#### 4.5 MPL (Mozilla Public License)
*   **Stringency:** A "middle ground" license, less strict than GPL but more so than BSD/Apache.
*   **Origin:** Developed to disclose the source code of the Netscape browser.
*   **Key Feature:** Clearly defines the scope of source code to be disclosed.
*   **Obligation:** The **modified parts of the MPL code itself** must be distributed under the MPL. This means changes to the MPL-licensed file must remain open-source under MPL, but proprietary code linking to it does not necessarily have to be.

XIll. Trends  of Open-Source  Software
>> Recent  trends and major issues
The recent trend of software  development  is focused on the conviction  that a company’s
competitiveness  depends  on how quickly it develops  and releases  software  on the market. In this
respect,  time to service, not time to market, is becoming  a key factor. A quick response  using a
development  methodology  that is reliant on proprietary  software  is not possible  in this environment.
As a result, software  development  and the necessity  of using open-source  software  are increasing  as
several  technologies  can be used.
1. To be able to explain the concept  and license  of open-source  software.
2. To be able to understand  and use open-source  software  licenses.
>> Keywords
- Concept  of open-source  software,  open-source  software  license

+ Preview  for practical  business Do we need to manage  open-source
software?
As more open-source  software  is used, the need for license management  is also increasing,  because
disputes  over licensing  can damage  a corporate  image and cause financial losses too. In particular,
the use of open-source  software  seems to be spreading  further in this era of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution,  which can also increase  dispute  factors.
As the source code of open-source  software  is opened, there are several benefits when developing
a technology  or product  that uses it, such as reducing  the development  time and cost, and breaking
technological  dependence.  However,  though anyone can use an open-source  license, users should
follow the license terms when distributing  it to a third party intending  to use it for technology  or
product  development.
Last year, a domestic  software  company  called Hangul and Computer  was sued for breach of
copyright  by Artifex in the U.S. on a charge of violating  the open-source  license. Artifex claimed
that Hangul and Computer  had violated  the license when selling “Hangeul’  programs  equipped  with
“Ghostscript”  (a PDF conversion  library), which was developed  and distributed  by Artifex with a GPL.
Artifex filed a lawsuit  in the California  court, and Hangul and Computer's  request  for its dismissal  was
rejected.  In the end, Hangul and Computer  had to pay the settlement  money  to end the lawsuit.
One official at the National  IT Industry  Promotion  Agency  said, “This incident  is a case which shows
how a corporate  image can be damaged  and financial  losses  incurred  by unauthorized  use of the GPL
code. This case reminded  us again of the importance  of complying  with open source software.’
One official at the National  IT Industry  Promotion  Agency  said, “The incident  was the case that tells
us deterioration  of corporate  image and financial  loss due to the unauthorized  use of the GPL code.
The case reminded  us again of the importance  of complying  with the open-source  software.”
Disputes  over open-source  licenses are increasing  because  we did not introduce  and manage the
open-source  license systematically  due to the erroneous  perception that it is free of charge. In
addition,  open-source  licenses  are complex  as there are more than 2,000 types of license.  According
to a NIPA survey, 37% of domestic  SMEs violated  the license in 2016.
It was pointed out that we need to establish  an open-source  license management  system quickly,
because  the use of open-source  software  seems to be increasing  in the field of new technology  such
as the Internet  of Things (loT), artificial  intelligence  (Al), big data, cloud, etc.
It is essential  that enterprises  and public institutions  using open-source  software  take
countermeasures  such as establishing  governance  and utilizing license analytics  and verification
tools.

01 Concept  of Open-Source  Software
A) Definition  of open-source  software
Open-source  software  is free software  that can be used, copied, and modified  by anyone  while protecting  the
rights of the creator.
As the software  industry  began to develop, a move was made to impose restrictions  on the use and
modification  of software  based on the intellectual  property  rights and license agreement  in 1980. To oppose  to
this move and protect  the rights of free software  use, Richard  Stallman  founded  the Free Software  Foundation
(FSF) and launched  the free software  movement,  which ultimately  became  the origin of open-source  software.
Open-source  software  includes FSF free software in Korea. However,  free software  pursues  the meaning  of
emphasizing  users’ freedom,  while open-source  software pursues  the idea that the source code must be
