### 1. IT Governance

**Definition:** IT Governance refers to the principles and frameworks used to evaluate, direct, and monitor how companies utilize IT.

**A. IT Governance Process**
This process consists of four stages:

1.  **Planning Stage**
    *   **Goal:** Link business strategy with IT, set IT goals.
    *   **Activities:** Establish structures, rules for IT activities, resource use, risk management, governance structure, and performance measurement.

2.  **Operations Stage**
    *   **Goal:** Monitor and manage IT activities.
    *   **Activities:** Monitor IT resources, IT risks, IT management, and IT performance. Set targets for performance and measure their achievement.

3.  **Evaluation Stage**
    *   **Goal:** Assess the value delivered by IT.
    *   **Activities:** Evaluate IT value, considering strategic, economic, risk management, technical, social, and quality benefits. Calculate IT value by subtracting business and potential risk costs from business opportunities.

4.  **Feedback Stage**
    *   **Goal:** Improve IT governance based on evaluation.
    *   **Activities:** Implement corrective measures and improvements to IT governance activities and related jobs.

**B. Key Focus Areas of IT Governance**
These five areas link IT to company strategies:

1.  **Strategic Alignment**
    *   **Focus:** Aligning IT with company strategy; ensuring IT decisions support business direction.
    *   **Method:** Enterprise Architecture (EA)

2.  **IT Value Delivery**
    *   **Focus:** Optimizing IT integration with business processes to achieve IT business goals.
    *   **Method:** Backbone systems, IT Compliance

3.  **Risk Management**
    *   **Focus:** Managing IT-related risk factors to ensure business continuity.
    *   **Method:** Disaster Recovery System (DRS), Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

4.  **Resource Management**
    *   **Focus:** Organizing and managing IT resources to quickly respond to business requirements.
    *   **Method:** IT Asset Management (ITAM)

5.  **Performance Measurement**
    *   **Focus:** Establishing an IT-centered system to evaluate performance of IT business activities.
    *   **Method:** Balanced Scorecard (BSC), IT Return on Investment (IT ROI)

### 2. Enterprise Architecture (EA)

**A. Overview of EA**

*   **Definition:** EA is a blueprint that clearly explains an enterprise's IT business to stakeholders. Its purpose is to help the enterprise achieve its strategic goals and information resource management objectives. It defines the current and desired future state of the relationship between IT and the enterprise.

*   **Need for EA:**
    *   **Problem:** Without macro-level planning, rapid adoption of information systems can lead to redundant systems, lack of collaboration, and the "IT Productivity Paradox" (adopting IT without seeing increased profits).
    *   **Solution:** EA provides an overall view of the business and creates close working relationships between different information resources, preventing these issues.

**B. Conceptual Diagram and Components of EA**

*   **Conceptual Flow:**

    `Enterprise Architecture (EA)`
    ↓
    `Business Architecture (BA)` | `Application Architecture (AA)` | `Data Architecture (DA)` | `Technical Architecture (TA)`

*   **Components of an EA:** EA is an act and instrument of IT governance. Its key components are:
    1.  **IT Governance:** (As defined above) Manages the process of aligning IT with business goals.
    2.  **Business Architecture (BA)**
        *   **Focus:** Designing how people, processes, and information interact based on business strategy and environment analysis.
        *   **Reference Model:** Performance Reference Model (PRM)
    3.  **Application Architecture (AA)**
        *   **Focus:** Identifying information needed for jobs, defining activities for processing/managing it. Creating standards for application functions and environments.
        *   **Reference Model:** Service Component Reference Model (SRM)
    4.  **Data Architecture (DA)**
        *   **Focus:** Identifying required documents, designing data models by understanding relationships between all information, data, and data structures.
        *   **Reference Model:** Data Reference Model (DRM)
    5.  **Technology Architecture (TA)**
        *   **Focus:** Defining criteria for selecting infrastructure and other technologies that support business and data applications. Also defines technical support services.
        *   **Reference Model:** Technology Reference Model (TRM)
    6.  **Standard Profile (SP)**
        *   **Focus:** A sub-structure of TA that defines the detailed list of technologies (e.g., JAVA architecture version: JDK 2.0).

**C. EA Frameworks**
These are leading frameworks for establishing an EA:

1.  **Zachman Framework**
    *   **Description:** Most frequently used. Defined as a matrix using views (perspectives) and descriptions.
    *   **5 Perspectives:** Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, Subcontractor.
    *   **6 Descriptions:** Data, Function, Network, People, Time, Motivation.

2.  **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)**
    *   **Description:** Open framework focusing on interoperability between companies.
    *   **Components:** Architecture Development Method (ADM) cycle, Technology Reference Model (TRM), and a Standards Information Point (SIP) database. Uses a building block approach.

3.  **FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework)**
    *   **Description:** Developed by the U.S. CIO Council. Manages all Zachman framework content.
    *   **Components:** Eight components, 4-step progressive structure. Defines five reference models (Business, Performance, Data, Service Component, Technology). Forms the basis of Japan's EA framework. Includes AS-IS (current state) and TO-BE (future state) gap analysis for implementation.

### 3. Information Strategic Planning (ISP)

**A. Overview of ISP**

*   **Definition:** "Information Strategy Plan." It presents a vision for the information system and management structure needed to support an enterprise's mid-to-long term goals and business plan. Essentially, it's a rough sketch for the direction of long-term information system deployment.

**B. ISP Deployment Procedure**

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the company's external and internal environment using tools like SWOT, 5-Force, 7S, and 4C.
    *   Analyze the information environment, including technology requirements, trends, and new technology applications.

2.  **Current Operations Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the company's current operations, focusing critically on **business processes**.
    *   Examine existing information systems.
    *   Identify stakeholder requirements and areas for improvement.

3.  **Benchmarking:**
    *   Review earlier cases in similar industries to identify missing or distorted information and refine the plan.

[Fig.18]  IT governance  process
@ Planning  stage
The planning  stage involves  linking business  with IT, setting  the goals of IT, establishing  the structures,  activities  and
mechanisms  regarding  the rules on organizing  IT related activities,  using resources,  managing  risks, the governance
structure,  and measuring  performance.
@ Operations  stage
The monitoring  of IT resources,  IT risks and IT management  involves  all the structures,  activities  and related
mechanisms  for helping companies  to monitor  their IT resources,  IT risks and IT management.  The monitoring  of
IT performance  measurement  involves  the structures,  activities  and related mechanisms  for helping  companies  to
set target levels (for their performances  related to IT resources,  IT risks and IT management)  and measure  their
attainment  of such targets.
@ Evaluation  stage
IT value is evaluated  through  the eamings  and costs of the future business  opportunities  delivered  to the company.
IT value includes  strategic,  economic,  and risk management,  as well as technical,  social and quality  benefits.  To arrive
at the IT value, the costs of business  risk and other potential  risk costs are subtracted  from business  opportunities.
@ Feedback  stage
Based on the results of the evaluation  of the feedback  information  and the need to prioritize  this information,  during
this stage a company  takes corrective  measures  aimed at improving  its IT governance  activities.  Included in such

corrective  measures  are the structures,  activities  and procedures  for improving  the IT governance  process  and the
related  jobs.
D) Key focus areas of IT governance
IT governance  has five key areas of focus, all of which are linked to the strategies  of a company. IT governance  looks
at how a company’s  strategies  are used in conjunction  with IT value, and also includes  the management  of risk factors
and the management  of resources,  as well as a performance  evaluation  system on activities.

03 Concept  of EA
A) Overview  of EA (Enterprise  Architecture)
© Definition  of EA
EA stands for “enterprise  architecture’.  It is a blueprint  that explains  the IT business  of an enterprise  in a way that is
easy for the stakeholders  to understand, so that the enterprise  can achieve  its strategic  goals and the goals of its
information  resource  management.
“Enterprise  architecture  is a blueprint  that defines the current  state of the relationship  between  information
technology  and an enterprise(as  well as the activities  carried out by the enterprise)  and the state that the enterprise
must strive for in the future.’-United  States Office of Management  and Budget  (OMB)
@ Need for EA
Currently,  enterprises  are enthusiastically  introducing  information  systems  to cope with the rapidly changing  business
environments,  but if information  systems  are deployed  without  proper planning  at the macro level, enterprises  will
be confronted  with a redundant  system and an inability  to collaborate.  Such enterprises  will fall into the so-called  "IT
Productivity  Paradox’1  which can be described  as the continuous  adoption  of information  systems  without  seeing
any benefits  in the form of increased  corporate  profits.
