## Software Development Essentials: A Learning Guide

This guide condenses key information on UI/UX, programming languages, and development environments.

---

### **1. UI/UX Fundamentals**

**UX (User Experience):**
*   **Definition:** The feeling, attitude, and behavior of the user when interacting with a product. It's about the overall experience and how visible elements work.
*   **Focus:** Improvements based on user statistics and studies.

**UI (User Interface):**
*   **Definition:** The environment where the user directly interacts with the interface. It's the visible part.
*   **Focus:** Realization of UX improvement studies; the interface itself.

**Key Differences between UX and UI:**

| Feature   | UX (User Experience) | UI (User Interface)      |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Nature**  | Process              | Result                   |
| **Metaphor**| Dish (concept)       | Food (tangible item)     |
| **Action**  | Planning             | Design                   |
| **Driver**  | Emotion              | Reason                   |

### **2. UI/UX Design Tools**

These tools help organize ideas, analyze services, run tests, and improve work efficiency.

**A) MAKE - Turning Ideas into Products:**
*   **Organizing Information:** GitHub, Trello
*   **Wire-frames:** Microsoft Visio, Moqups
*   **Prototyping:** Adobe Photoshop, Sketch3

**B) CHECK - Checking User Analysis & Response Methods:**
*   **Visual Analytics:** Beusable, Clicktale
*   **Analytics & Metrics:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel

### **3. Programming Languages & Development Environment**

**Recent Trends:**
*   **Popularity:** Java and C-like languages are dominant, especially for mobile/cloud development.
*   **Importance:** These languages are foundational for learning others and are widely used in business.

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Understand characteristics of programming languages (unstructured, structured, object-oriented).
*   Compare major languages (C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript).
*   Understand software development frameworks and their types.
*   Understand Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

**Practical Considerations: Selecting a Programming Language**
*   **Criteria:** Hardware, OS, existing solutions, business needs, latest languages, available developers.
*   **Reality:** Often based on experience. Multiple languages and architectures are common in a single project, especially for complex mobile services.
*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Java for batch tasks:** Can face performance issues.
    *   **C for speed:** May lead to productivity and test coverage problems.
*   **Key takeaway:** No single "best" language; selection involves balancing various factors.

**Software Development Framework and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
*   **Modern Development:** Involves global collaboration, diverse languages/versions, and maintaining old code.
*   **Adaptation:** Collaboration, customer support, and coding methods are evolving to meet rapid business changes.
*   **IDE Role:** Supports continuous integration to deliver services on time.
*   **Framework Components:** Execution, development, operation, and management environments.
*   **Benefits:** Improves productivity by maximizing modularization and reusability, and offers libraries for better software quality.

### **4. Programming Language Overview**

**A) Concept of a Programming Language:**
*   **Purpose:** Enables humans to communicate instructions to computers using human-like language.
*   **Translation:** Programs are translated into machine language (0s and 1s) by a **compiler** or **interpreter** so computers can understand them.
*   **Selection:** Choosing the right language is crucial for achieving productivity and quality goals, as each language has specific uses.

**B) Low-level vs. High-level Languages:**

| Item              | Low-Level Language                                | High-Level Language                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | Machine-centric; fast execution.                  | Easy to write; human-readable; highly productive.        |
| **Readability**   | Difficult for humans.                             | Similar to natural language; easy for humans.            |
| **Compatibility** | Machine-specific (different code for each machine). | Machine-independent; translated by compiler/interpreter. |
| **Examples**      | Machine Language (0s and 1s), Assembly Language.  | FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, C, C++, Java, Python.             |

**C) Areas of Use of Programming Languages:**

| Area of Use          | Major Programming Languages |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Science & Technology | FORTRAN, ALGOL60            |
| Business             | COBOL                       |
| Artificial Intelligence | LISP, PROLOG                |
| System Programming   | PL/S, BLISS, ALGOL, C/C++, Java, Python |
| Special Purposes     | GPSS (for simulation)       |

---

### **5. Language Translation Methods**

**A) Interpreter Languages:**
*   **Process:** Directly convert and execute source programs into a low-level language **without** an intermediate compiled step. Executes line by line.
    *   *Simplified:* Write code → Load into memory → Execute directly.
*   **Examples:** LISP, PROLOG.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Programs execute immediately without waiting for full translation.
    *   Memory can be saved as the source form is maintained until execution.
*   **Shortcomings:**
    *   Slower execution for repeated runs because the code must be decoded (translated) every time.

**B) Compiler Languages:**
*   **Process:** Translates the entire high-level source code into a machine-language "object module" (binary file) first. This module is then linked, loaded, and executed as an independent program.
    *   *Simplified:* Write code → Compile (creates executable program) → Load into memory → Execute.
*   **Examples:** FORTRAN, PASCAL, C/C++.
*   **Key steps:**
    1.  **Compilation:** High-level code → Machine Language (object module).
    2.  **Linking/Loading:** Object module combined with libraries to create an executable program.
    3.  **Execution:** The executable program runs.

work to make invisible  things  visible. In addition,  UX is the feeling, attitude,  and behavior  of the user, whereas
Ulis the environment  in which the user faces the interface  directly.  UX is also a study on improvements  based
on statistics  relating  to user experience,  while UI is the realization  of such improvement  studies. That is, UX
refers to experience  of what is visible, whereas  UI refers to the interface  itself that is shown to the user. The
main differences  between  UI/UX can be briefly summarized  as follows.

Selecting  a programming  language
In a real enterprise  environment,  the selection  criteria for programming  languages  for the
development  of products  and services  are determined  in various ways. Hardware,  OS environment,
introduced  solutions,  business characteristics,  application  of the latest development  languages,
and the status of available  developers are just some of these criteria. However,  it is true that an
alternative  language  is selected  if there are only a few developers  and labor costs are excessively
high, even though  the given development  language  is eminently  usable.
For example,  if Java is selected  to implement  all the functions  of a given project  to develop  a system
with numerous  batch-like  tasks, then the project is likely to face the difficult  problem  of having to
improve batch performance.  Alternatively,  if the C language  is selected in order to improve  speed
only, there is a high possibility  that the project  will be faced with the difficult  problem  of productivity
and test coverage.
Therefore,  the reality is that many projects  select a programming  language  based on experience,
and various languages  and architectures  are applied in the same project.  In particular,  complexity  and
diversity  increase  significantly  in recent development  projects  that require mobile services in various
fields.
Software  development  framework  and integrated  development  environment  (IDE)
These days, software  developers  collaborate  with developers  around the world who use different
languages  and different  versions  of the compiler  and may have to write new codes or maintain
the software,  which itself may use an old library that is more than 10 years old. To adapt to the
rapidly changing  business  environment,  the methods  of collaboration,  customer  support,  and coding
are changing.  Also, an integrated  development  environment based on a continuous  integration
environment  is created to provide services  on time. The framework  consist...
