# Learning Guide: UI/UX Design & Programming Languages

## Section VII: User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Design

### Introduction to UI/UX

*   **Core Importance:** UI/UX are critical for a computer system's success, directly impacting user satisfaction and system effectiveness.
*   **Recent Trends:** Growing focus on user-centric planning and design, especially in mobile business, to secure customers and increase sales.
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    1.  Understand and apply UI design principles.
    2.  Explain Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
    3.  Understand and use Graphic User Interface (GUI).
*   **Keywords:** UI/UX, HCI (Human Computer Interaction), GUI (Graphic User Interface)

### The Critical Role of UX: A Real-World Example

*   **Poor UX Dangers:** Bad user experience can have severe consequences, even leading to harm or death, especially in fields like medical devices.
*   **Therac-25 Case Study:**
    *   **Device:** A radiation therapy machine from the 1970s.
    *   **Problem:** An upgrade introduced a poorly designed error message.
    *   **Outcome:** A patient died due to excessive radiation exposure, caused by the therapist misinterpreting the unclear error message.
    *   **Lesson:** User mistakes, often triggered by complex or non-intuitive design, can pose a greater risk than physical device defects. **UX is paramount.**

### 01. User Interface (UI) Overview

*   **Definition of "Interface":** A device that connects two objects for smooth interaction.
*   **Definition of User Interface (UI):** The device or software that facilitates smooth information exchange between a user and a system. It's like the "window" through which a user interacts (e.g., keyboard input, mouse clicks, menu selections).
*   **Key UI Design Principles:**
    *   **A) Consistency:** UIs should look and behave consistently across the system. Establish standards early in development.
    *   **B) User-Centered Design:** Design with the user in mind, making it easy to learn and control.
    *   **C) Feedback:** Provide clear and meaningful feedback for user actions, including mistakes, to help users understand what happened.
    *   **D) Confirming Destructive Behavior:** Always ask for confirmation before executing irreversible actions (e.g., deleting data). The "Undo" function is a useful tool to prevent critical errors.

### 02. User Experience (UX) Overview

*   **Definition of UX:** The overall experience a user has when interacting with a system or service to achieve a goal. It encompasses feelings, emotions, perceptions, attitudes, and responses. UX design focuses on creating a convenient and effective environment for users.
*   **Key Differences: UX vs. UI**
    *   **UX:**
        *   Focuses on the *invisible* aspects (feelings, attitudes, behavior).
        *   Represents the *process* or *planning* phase.
        *   Deals with *emotions* and comprehensive *experience*.
        *   Studies improvements based on user statistics.
        *   *Analogy:* The "dish" (overall dining experience).
    *   **UI:**
        *   Focuses on the *concrete, visible* elements (the interface itself).
        *   Represents the *result* or *design* phase.
        *   Deals with *reason* and the direct environment the user faces.
        *   Is the *realization* of UX improvement studies.
        *   *Analogy:* The "food" (what is physically presented).

| Feature      | UX (User Experience)                               | UI (User Interface)                               |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Concept**  | Process, Planning, Emotion, Overall Experience     | Result, Design, Reason, Direct Interface          |
| **Focus**    | Why, What, and How a user feels when using a product | How the product's interface looks and functions |

### 03. UI/UX Design Tools

These tools help designers organize ideas, visualize concepts, analyze services, and test user experiences.

*   **A) MAKE - Turning Ideas into Products:**
    *   **Organizing Information:** GitHub, Trello
    *   **Wire-frames:** Microsoft Visio, Moqups (for structural blueprints)
    *   **Prototyping:** Adobe Photoshop, Sketch3 (for creating interactive models)
*   **B) Check - Checking User Analysis and Response Methods:**
    *   **Visual Analytics:** Beusable, Clicktale (to see user interaction visually)
    *   **Analytics & Metrics:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel (for quantitative data)
    *   **A/B Testing:** Google Optimize, Optimizely (to compare different versions of a design)
    *   **Record Users:** Beusable, Hotjar (to watch how users interact)
*   **C) Think - Checking Market Feedback Continuously:**
    *   **Recruiting Users:** Pivot Planet, Clarity (to find testers)
    *   **Online Surveys:** Polldaddy, Hotjar (to gather user opinions)
    *   **Capture In-site Feedback:** LiveChat, Mouseflow (for real-time feedback)
    *   **Testing Layouts Remotely:** Chalkmark, UsabilityHub (for remote usability testing)

* Preview  for practical business Even human life can be harmed  by a
poorly  designed  UX.
In the medical  device field, where software  directly  impacts  human life, people are more sensitive  than
in any other field since minor defects in a medical  device can have devastating  consequences  for a
patient,  even including  death. So which of the following  could have more catastrophic  consequences,
a faulty in a physical  device or a user’s mistake  during an operation?  Most people answer  the former:
however,  user mistakes  resulting  from complex  operational methods  and such like can pose a greater
risk. For example,  if the pad attachment  position  of a cardiac  defibrillator  is not intuitively  described,
emergency  measures  will not have any effect, and the result is likely to be the opposite.  The following
examples  show how important  UX is.
Therac 25, a radiation  therapy  device developed  in the early ’70s,
was upgraded  to address the inconvenience  caused by the
separation  of physical device setting  and prescription  processing  by
the administrator  console. In July 1985, an accident  occurred  during
radiation  therapy  at the Ontario (Canada)  Cancer  Foundation,  where
a patient died from excessive  exposure  to radiation  in November  of
the same year. A report on the analysis  of medical  accidents  revealedvy
that the accident  was caused by a wrongly  designed  error message
during the upgrade.  In the end, the accident  was attributed to the
fact that the radiation  therapist  was insensitive  to the unknown  error—message  of Therac  25. (Similar  error messages  were distinguished  by
the number  at the end of each message,  which cannot be clearly identified.)  Because  of this, the
device was abnormally  interrupted  five times, exposing  the patient  to excessive  radiation  during
treatment.
Recently,  many companies  have striver to maximize  the use of the customers  using the information
on the limited size screen to secure more customers  and increase  sales in the field of mobile business
using smartphones.  Moreover,  a growing  number  of companies  are contemplating  using UI/UX to
provide  customer-oriented  valuable  services  and forming  expert  organizations.

01 User Interface  Overview
The word “Interface”  refers to a device that faces each other between  two objects as the composition  of the
word (“inter’+’face’)  implies. The user interface  refers to a device or software  that ensures  a smooth  exchange
of information  between  user and system. It acts like a window for software.  For example,  if a user inputs/
outputs  commands  or selects a menu using a keyboard  or mouse to use a specific software,  it belongs  to the
user interface. The interface  should be designed  with a focus on the following  points.
A) Consistency
The user interface  should be created consistently.  However,  it is generally  difficult  to maintain  consistency
when developing  a large system,  since several people design and implement  user interfaces.  User interface
standards  should be established  before development  to make user interfaces  consistent,  and user interfaces
should also be checked  after their development  to correct  any errors.
B) User-centered  design
The user interface  should be designed  with a focus on the user because  it is for the user, who should be able
to control it effectively.  Therefore, it is essential  to design the user interface  in such a way that users can learn
“input and output  language’  easily.
C) Feedback
The user interface  should provide meaningful  feedback.  When a user presses  a wrong button or tries to
perform an operation  incorrectly,  the user interface  should enable the user to easily understand  his or her
mistakes.
D) Confirming  destructive  behavior
When a user tries to delete data or files, the user interface  should confirm  it before executing  it. If possible,  the
user interface  should be designed  in such a way that the user cannot  cause critical errors. The Undo function is
also a useful method in this regard.
