## Project Management & Technical Communication: Cost Management & Estimation

This guide covers essential concepts in project cost management, including estimation methods, budgeting, control, and specific estimation techniques.

### 1. Cost Estimation Methods

These are general techniques for estimating project costs:

*   **Analogous Estimating:**
    *   Estimates current project cost based on scope, cost, budget, and duration of similar past projects.
*   **Bottom-up Estimating:**
    *   Estimates by summing costs of the smallest work packages to get the total project cost.
    *   **Pros:** More accurate.
    *   **Cons:** Time-consuming, affected by individual activity complexity.
*   **Expert Judgment:**
    *   Uses experts' knowledge of labor, materials, inflation, and risks from similar projects and the current environment.
*   **Three-point Estimating:**
    *   Estimates project cost using three values: most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic.
    *   Accounts for uncertainty and risk in cost estimation.

### 2. Budgeting

Budgeting is the process of creating an approved **cost baseline** by aggregating individual cost estimations. It ensures all costs are managed in an integrated way.

*   **Cost Baseline:**
    *   The approved version of the project budget.
    *   **Excludes:** Management reserves.
    *   **Includes:** Contingency reserves (for unplanned activities or known risks).
*   **Project Budget:**
    *   The total sum of the **cost baseline** and **management reserves**.
*   **Contingency Reserves:**
    *   Funds set aside for *known-unknowns* (e.g., risks identified but not fully understood). Included in the cost baseline.
*   **Management Reserves:**
    *   Funds set aside for *unknown-unknowns* (unforeseen scope changes or major risks). Not included in the cost baseline; typically controlled by senior management (CTO, CEO).

### 3. Cost Control

Cost control monitors project cost status and manages changes to the cost baseline.

*   **Earned Value Management (EVM):**
    *   A method used for cost control and performance measurement.
    *   Compares the actual cost and progress of work to the planned budget.
    *   **Example Illustration:** If an activity planned for 5 days at KRW 300,000/day (total KRW 1,500,000) is only 90% complete by the due date, the "earned value" is KRW 1,350,000 (5 days * 0.9 * KRW 300,000). The difference (KRW 1,500,000 - KRW 1,350,000 = KRW 150,000) indicates the work that hasn't been completed as scheduled, implying an excessive cost spent for the actual work done.

### 4. Cost Estimation Techniques (Specific Methods)

Common techniques for estimating software development costs include Function Point (FP), Man/Month (M/M), and COCOMO.

#### A) Function Point (FP)

*   **What it is:** An international standard (ISO/IEC 14143) for estimating software development cost by measuring its functional size from a user's perspective. It quantifies functions requested by and delivered to users.
*   **Use Cases:** Software development, maintenance, and operation.
*   **Advantages:** Can estimate project size early by identifying user requirements, unlike LOC-based (Lines Of Code) methods.
*   **Function Types:**
    *   **Data Functions:**
        *   Internal Logical Files (ILF)
        *   External Interface Files (EIF)
    *   **Transaction Functions:**
        *   External Inputs (EI)
        *   External Outputs (EO)
        *   External Inquiries (EQ)

**Function Point Calculation Process:**

1.  **Determine Type of Count:** Choose Development, Enhancement, or Application FP count.
2.  **Identify Scope & Boundary:** Define full software scope and application boundaries.
3.  **Measure Data Functions:**
    *   Identify ILF and EIF.
    *   Determine complexity (based on Data Element Types (DET) - number of attributes, and Record Element Types (RET) - number of subgroups).
    *   Derive data function points.
4.  **Measure Transaction Functions:**
    *   Identify EI, EO, EQ for each activity unit.
    *   Determine complexity (based on DET and File Transfer Reference Types (FTR)).
    *   Derive transaction function points.
5.  **Determine Unadjusted Function Points (UFP):**
    *   UFP = Sum of Data Function Points + Transaction Function Points.
6.  **Determine Value Adjustment Factor (VAF):**
    *   **General System Characteristics (GSCs):** Evaluate 14 characteristics (e.g., Data communications, Performance, Reusability) on a scale of 0-5.
    *   **Total Degree of Influence (TDI):** Sum of weighted GSC values.
    *   **VAF Formula:** `VAF = (TDI * 0.01) + 0.65`
7.  **Determine Adjusted Function Points (AFP):**
    *   `Adjusted FP Count = Unadjusted FP Count × VAF`

**Function Point Analysis (FPA) Methods:**

*   **Estimated FPA:** Uses weighted average complexity ratings (High/Avg/Low); applied in planning and acquisition stages.
*   **Detailed FPA:** Determines specific complexity; applied after the design stage.
*   **Current Practice:** FPA is widely used, especially in public projects, for cost estimation based on functional requirements.

#### B) Man/Month (MM)

*   **What it is:** A method to estimate project cost based on the total labor consumed, drawing from previous similar projects.
*   **Project Development Cost Formula:**
    `Total Cost = Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost + Royalty + Direct Cost`

1.  **Direct Labor Cost:**
    *   Determined by allocating required labor for each work package (from WBS).
    *   Calculated using unit price per labor (e.g., average wages for software engineers published by industry associations, often varying by engineer classification like Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Principal).
2.  **Overhead Cost:**
    *   Indirect expenses for administrative operations (planning, management, general affairs).
    *   Typically calculated as 110-120% of direct labor cost.
3.  **Royalty:**
    *   Payment for using and accumulating developed technology.
    *   Typically calculated as 20-40% of (Direct Labor Cost + Overhead Cost).
4.  **Direct Cost:**
    *   Expenses directly for software development (e.g., royalties for software tools, professional fees, travel, materials).
*   **Current Practice:** Man/Month is commonly used in private projects and for cross-verification with FPA (especially in public projects where FPA is often mandatory).

#### C) COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

*   **What it is:** A software cost estimation model that uses a regression formula with parameters like development period, man-months, and maintenance costs applied to system modules and subsystems.
*   **Types by Calculation Complexity:**
    *   **Basic:** Simpler calculation.
    *   **Intermediate:** More detailed, considers cost drivers.
    *   **Detailed:** Most complex, applies cost drivers to individual modules.
*   **Types by Project Type:**
    *   **Organic Mode:** Small, simple projects with experienced teams.
    *   **Semi-Detached Mode:** Medium-sized projects, mixed experience teams.
    *   **Embedded Mode:** Complex, large-scale projects with strict constraints.
    *   Each mode considers effort, development time, average staff size, and productivity differently.

**Basic COCOMO Model Calculation (Effort):**

*   **Effort (E):** `E = a * (KLOC)^b`
    *   `a` and `b` are coefficients that vary based on the project type (Organic, Semi-Detached, Embedded).
    *   **KLOC (Kilo Line Of Code):** The estimated number of delivered lines of code, in thousands.

Three-point  Estimating
C) Budgeting+ Amethod  of estimating  project  cost using the most likely, optimistic,  and pessimistic  values.
It takes into account  uncertainty  and risk in cost estimation.
It is a process’  of creating  an approved  cost baseline  by collecting  individual  activities  and work packages  of
cost estimation,  or estimated  costs, in order to manage  all costs in an integrated  manner. The cost baseline
is the approved  version  of the project  budget,  excluding  management  reserves.  After all, the project  budget  is
the sum of the management  reserves  and the cost baseline.
Contingency  reserves,  used in case of contingencies  other than planned  activities  by project  managers,  are in-
cluded in the cost baseline.  However,  management  reserves  are an expense  that can be enforced  by the Chief
Technical  Officer  (CTO), sponsor,  or CEO.
D) Cost control
Project  cost control is a process  of monitoring  the status of project  cost management  and baseline  changes.

[Figure 35] Cost Control  Screen (Example)
In the example  above, the duration  of the [Writing]  activity  was calculated  as five days, and it was planned
to be completed  by July 31st. As of August Ist, the five days of planning  have not been completed.  If the ac-
tivity is calculated  as the cost (assuming  KRW 300,000  per day), it is 5 (days) x 0.9 (completion  rate) x KRW
300,000  = KRW 1,350,000.  In addition,  if the activity had been completed  as scheduled,  it would be, if calcu-
lated as a cost, KRW 1,500,000.  In other words, as of August Ist, 1,500,000-1,350,000  = KRW 150,000  of work
has not been completed,  meaning  the cost of KRW 150,000  has been excessively  spent.
The above cost control management  method is called Earned Value Method,  and cost control management
applying  EVM is called Earned Value Management.
03 Cost Estimation  Technique
The most common  project  cost estimation  techniques  include  Function  Point (FP), Man/Month  (M/M), and COCOMO.
A) Function  point (FP)
Function  Point is a method  of estimating  the cost by measuring  the scale of software  development  as a Func-
tion Point (FP) and multiplying  the unit price per function  point. It is an international  standard  (ISO/IEC  14143)
that quantitatively  calculates  functions  requested  by and delivered  to users from a user's point of view, and is
a cost calculation  method  for software  development,  maintenance  and operation.
Compared  to the LOC (Line Of Code)-based  COCOMO  method or the Man/Month  (M/M) method,  it has the
characteristic  of grasping  the size of the development  project before initiation  by identifying  the required
function  of the user.
Software  functions  are divided into Data Functions  and Transaction  Functions,  and more specifically,  data
functions  are subdivided  into Internal Logical Files and External  Interface  Files, and transaction  functions  are
subdivided  into three types: External  Inputs, External  Outputs,  and External  Inquiries.
