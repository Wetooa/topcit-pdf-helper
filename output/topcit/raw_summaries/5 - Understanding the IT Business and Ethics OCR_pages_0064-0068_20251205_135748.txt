### 2. Case Study: COMWEL's Process Innovation (PI) (Page 65)

**Context:** The Korea Workers’ Compensation & Welfare Service (COMWEL) successfully implemented a large-scale Process Innovation (PI) project to enhance public services.

**What is Process Innovation (PI)?**
*   A comprehensive approach to improving business processes.
*   **Requires:** Company-wide consensus (from top management to staff), application of best practices, and full internalization within the organization.
*   **Challenge:** Often difficult for conservative public institutions to implement.

**COMWEL's PI Goals & Approach:**
*   **Goal:** Improve public service quality despite limited human resources.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Internal Discussions:** Identified areas most needing improvement.
    2.  **AS-IS Process Diagnosis:** Analyzed existing processes.
    3.  **End-to-End Job Study:** Examined entire workflows for each job.
    4.  **Process Selection:** Chose processes for PI implementation.
    5.  **Requirements Gathering:** Identified needs at the working level.
    6.  **System Implementation:** Set up:
        *   **BPM (Business Process Management):** For managing business processes.
        *   **PKMS (Process-Based Knowledge Management System):** For managing process-related knowledge.
        *   **EID (Enterprise Information Display) system:** For displaying enterprise information.
    7.  **Systematization:** Completed for 25 out of 50 core processes with the highest expected impact.
    8.  **Focus:** Eliminated unnecessary procedures and simplified complex ones to improve public service.
*   **Continuous Improvement Framework:** Process establishment → Monitoring → Improvement activities → Process establishment.

**Benefits of COMWEL's PI:**
*   **Improved User Experience:** System provides more relevant information to user queries (relevancy increases with data).
*   **Enhanced Management:** Reduced risks by enabling quick modification of management strategies and providing an "at-a-glance" view of business plans and key information across all units.

the new business  management  strategy  of Starbucks
Starbucks,  which opened  its first store in Seattle,  Washington  in 1971, is the
world's largest multinational  coffee shop and currently  operates  23,187
stores in 64 countries  around  the world. For example,  it has 12,973 stores in
the United States, 1,550 in Canada, 1,088 in Japan, and 544in Korea. A |
unique experience,  high-quality  coffee and beverages,  friendly  employees,
TM anda friendly  coffee shop interior  are just some of the differentiating
factors that set it apart from the rest of the competition,  and which have
propelled  the company  to its commanding  market  position.  However,  the economic  downturn  that began in
2008 also affected  Starbucks,  whose sales dropped  by more than 50 percent  by the end of 2008. However,
Starbucks  used this seemingly  disastrous  market  situation  as an opportunity  to transform  its business  by
integrating  wireless  technology  and the mobile digital platform into its business  process.  As part of this
endeavor,  the company  conducted  a customer  analysis  whose results indicated  that more than 1/3 of its
customers  were enthusiastic  users of smartphones.  This finding led the company  to introduce  a
smartphone  app-based  payment  technology  with which customers  could pay for their purchases  using |
their prepaid  cards or rechargeable  cards. It also created  the ‘Starbucks  Digital Network’  in partnership  with
Yahoo after noticing  that visitors  to its stores were regularly using its free WiFi service. This network,
through  its content  portal function,  provides  free Wall Street  Journal articles  for customers  to read and free
downloadable  tunes from iTunes for customers  to enjoy. Furthermore,  the company  internally  worked on
making its business  process  more efficient.  Now, Starbucks  baristas  no longer have to bend down when
making coffee, while the total time spent waiting  for the coffee to be made has been minimized  and the
time spent on making  drinks has been reduced.  To this end, the company  formed the Lean Team to advise
the company  on benchmarking  the lean manufacturing  method pioneered  by Toyota Motor Company.
What's more, the company  built a smart work environment  with wireless  technology  that maximizes  the
work efficiency  of its employees.  Within this smart work environment,  Starbucks  employees  can do their
work in any store across the nation. This has resulted in about 25% longer store visiting times by the
company’s  regional  managers.  Howard  Schultz,  the CEO of Starbucks  said, "Most of the cost savings  gained
come from new ways of operating  our stores and new customer  services’.  Successful changes  like this
have helped Starbucks  to recover  its profitability  and maintain  its growth.

ESSENCE
+ Preview  for practical  business Pl Case Study: Korea Workers’  Compensation
& Welfare  Service  opens a new era
From 2010 to 2011, the Korea Workers  Compensation  & Welfare Service  (COMWEL)  built an advanced
administration  system through  a wide-scale  process  innovation  (Pl) project. Process  innovation  (Pl) cannot
be realized  simply by setting  up a system or with training  alone. It can only be successful  when there is a
company-wide  consensus  from the top management  level to the working-level  staff of the organization,
and when the best practices  are applied to the organization  process  and fully internalized.  For this reason,
it is very difficult  for conservative  public institutions  to implement  project innovations.  However,  with
COMWEL’s  systematic  project management  and utilization,  it has so successfully  implemented  process
innovation  that it has become  a benchmark  for other institutions  to follow.
COMWEL  pursued process  innovation  under the banner of ‘job efficiencies  through process innovation’
because  it wanted to improve  the quality of its public services  despite having limited human resources.
It began the task of increasing  job efficiency  with internal discussions  over those areas most in need of
improvement.  Starting  with AS-IS process  diagnosis  consulting,  COMWEL  next studied the end-to-end
process  of each job, and then selected  the processes  requiring  process innovation  (Pl). The requirements
at the working  level were identified  and extracted,  and the information  thus obtained  was used in setting
up the BPM, the process-based  knowledge  management  system (PKMS), and the enterprise  information
display (EID) system. Among 50 core processes,  systemization  was completed  for the 25 processes
that were expected  to produce  the greatest  effects once the process  innovations  were up and running.
COMWEL  focused  on improving  its public service by elim...
