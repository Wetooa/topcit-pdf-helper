# Learning Guide: Project Management and Technical Communication

This guide focuses on understanding and creating effective technical documents in an IT business context.

---

## 1. Introduction to Technical Documents

In IT projects, **Technical Documents** are crucial, alongside system development, for clear communication and successful project delivery. This guide covers their creation, characteristics, types, and writing techniques.

---

## 2. What are Technical Documents?

### 2.1. Definition
**Technical Documents** are official records that:
*   Describe products, handling instructions, functions, architecture, development, or use.
*   Provide enough information for various users (end-users, administrators, technicians) to understand a product fully.
*   Use specialized terminology from fields like engineering, technology, and science.

**Technical Communication** is a broader concept encompassing any writing or communication for business performance across industries.

### 2.2. Key Characteristics
Effective technical documents must possess:
*   **Clarity:**
    *   Meaning must be unambiguous; words and sentences should not be misinterpreted.
    *   Avoid abstract or metaphorical language to prevent confusion and ensure accuracy.
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   Content must be objectively factual, based on reliable materials and data.
    *   Logical reasoning using data must be precise and consistent throughout the document.
*   **Structuredness:**
    *   Often follow a specific format (e.g., reports, manuals, proposals).
    *   Components (introduction, body, conclusion) must be logically structured to maintain overall unity.

### 2.3. Types of Technical Documents
Technical documents provide information or solve problems, especially in SW development projects.

| Classification        | Types of Technical Documents                 |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Management** | Business Plan, Information Request Form (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), Project Management Plan, Requirement Traceability Matrix, Project Completion Report |
| **Project Development** | Analysis Document, Design Brief, Development Document, Testing Document, Manual |

## 3. How to Write Technical Documents

### 3.1. Writing Principles & Methods
Technical documents demand strict logic, accuracy, and adherence to specific formats.
*   **Logical & Formal:** Be precise with language rules and formal logic; avoid errors.
*   **Consistency:** Pay attention to numbering systems, spelling (especially foreign words and proper nouns), and grammar.
    *   **Example Numbering System:**
        *   First level: I, II, III...
        *   Second level: 1, 2, 3...
        *   Third level: 1), 2), 3)...
        *   Fourth level: (1), (2), (3)...
        *   Fifth level: ①, ②, ③...

### 3.2. Precautions for Writing
*   **Reader-Centric:** Write from the reader's perspective to ensure easy understanding and accurate judgment. Avoid jargon (unless explained), personal feelings, or relational biases.
*   **Self-Contained:** The document should be understandable without needing to refer to other materials. It should not leave readers with questions or confusion.
*   **Template-Based:** Always follow predefined templates for consistency and structure.

### 3.3. Ensuring Quality (Consistency, Accuracy, Suitability)
Proofreading and review are essential during the writing process to enhance document completeness, accuracy, and logic.

*   **Consistency:**
    *   Maintain a logical cause-and-effect relationship between core requirements and content.
    *   Keep a consistent nature (method, viewpoint) from start to finish. E.g., consistent font, color, descriptive techniques; logical arrangement of topics.
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   In SW documents, accurately describe stated structures and algorithms to show they meet required software functions.
*   **Suitability:**
    *   Documents must be appropriate for their intended purpose.
    *   Clearly state the document's purpose for the user's intended use.

## 4. Specific Technical Document Types

### 4.1. Business Plan
A guideline detailing project content, target market, market success potential, project feasibility, and future risk preparation.

#### Key Components:
1.  **General Status:** Project overview.
2.  **Goals:** Objectives to achieve.
3.  **Content:** Project specifics.
4.  **Business Method:** How the project will be conducted.
5.  **Cost & Personnel:** Promotion costs and required staff.
6.  **Expected Effects:** Anticipated outcomes.

#### Principles of Writing a Business Plan:
*   **Easy to Understand:** Convince investors and customers. Avoid technical terms; use simple, universal content.
*   **Feasibility:** Base claims on evidence from public/professional organizations to maintain reliability.
*   **Highlight Core Content:** Focus on product characteristics that appeal to consumers more than competitors.
*   **Consistency & Accuracy:** Unify numbers/units; maintain a consistent flow and theme to ensure credibility.
*   **In-depth Analysis of Problems & Risk Factors:** Thoroughly analyze potential issues and risks to prevent delays or project failure.

### 4.2. Request for Information (RFI)
A document used to gather general information from external companies to solve a problem. It's a preliminary step to identify potential vendors.

#### Key Information Requested:
*   Brief company introduction.
*   Credit-related information.
*   Experience in performing related services.
*   Project budget scope (if necessary).

#### Components of an RFI:

2.  **Information about Ordering Company:** Business status (goals, direction), informatization status, improvement needs.
3.  **Key Requirements:** Business and technical requirements, implementation, training, project management, project budget.

### 4.3. Request for Proposal (RFP)
An official document issued by an ordering agency to bidders. It informs bidders about the agency's system, business status, problems, and requirements for a project (e.g., establishing an information system). It allows proposers to detail how they will meet the agency's specific needs.

#### Components of an RFP:
1.  **Business Overview:** Background, necessity, service content, business scope, expected effects of the project.
2.  **Status and Problems:** Current business status, informatization status, existing problems, and desired improvement directions.

01 Concept  and Types of Technical  Documents
A) Definition  of technical  documents
Technical  documents  are documents  that record the description  of reference  documents  or product  handling,
function  and architecture  development/use,  and provide sufficient  information  so that not only end users but
also administrators  and service/maintenance  technicians  can understand  the interior/exterior  of the product.
Therefore, it can be defined  as a document  written  by using a lot of terminology  according  to the communica-
tion method  of specialized  fields such as engineering,  technology,  and science.
In other words, a technical  document  contains  content  such as explaining  a specific  fact, persuading  the other
party, or instructing  certain actions. In recent years, the concept  has been expanded  to technical  communi-
cation, meaning  “any writing  and communication  for business  performance  regardless  of business,  industry,  or
specialized  field”.
B) Features  of technical  documents
@ Clarity
The meaning  of a word or sentence  should not be interpreted  or distorted  differently  by readers. In particular,
abstract  and metaphorical  rhetoric  should be avoided in that it may cause confusion  and in order to convey
accurate  content.
@ Accuracy
Technical documents  should be written  with accurate  content  to conform  to objective  facts based on various
materials or  data. In addition,  the process  of developing  the logic using the materials or data given based on
rational  thinking  must remain accurate  and consistent.
@® Structuredness
As seen in reports, manuals,  and proposals,  technical  documents  often have a certain format. The elements
(introduction,  body, conclusion,  etc.) that make up the form of the text should be structured  and written so as
to achieve  overall unity.
C) Types of technical  documents
Technical  documents  serve to provide readers with information  or to solve specific  problems.  Technical  doc-
uments  that are commonly  used in relation to SW development  are closely related to the SW development
project  and can be classified  as follows.

02 Principles  and Methods  of Writing  Technical  Documents
A) Expression  and description  methods  of writing  technical  documents
Technical  documents  are documents  that must have accuracy  and logical validity, and they emphasize  strict
logic and format compared  to other documents.  Therefore,  it is important  to be faithful to the rules of lan-
guage and formal logic, to make sure there are no errors. You should pay attention  to the following  numbering
system,  commonly  misspelled  foreign words, and Korean spelling.
