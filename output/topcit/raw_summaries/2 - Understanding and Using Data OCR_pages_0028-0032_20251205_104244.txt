## Section 1: Introduction to Databases & DBMS

### 1.1 What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of data designed to:
*   **Control Access:** Restrict unauthorized users.
*   **Provide Interfaces:** Offer various types of interfaces for diverse users.
*   **Express Relationships:** Show complex connections between data.
*   **Ensure Integrity:** Maintain the accuracy and consistency of data.

### 1.2 What is a DBMS? (Database Management System)

A DBMS is software that manages and controls access to a database. It processes the database's file structure, memory, and major operations.

### 1.3 Key DBMS Components

| Component               | Function                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DDL Compiler**        | Processes the schema (database structure definition) written in DDL (Data Definition Language) into internal metadata, storing it in the **system catalog**. This catalog is used by all DBMS modules. |
| **Query Processor**     | Handles user queries: analyzes, parses, compiles, creates database access code, and sends it for execution. |
| **DML Pre-compiler**    | Extracts DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands from application programs for compilation.              |
| **DML Compiler**        | Parses and compiles received DML commands into object code for database access.                          |
| **Runtime DB Handler**  | Manages database operations (like search or update) during execution, using the stored data manager.       |
| **Transaction Manager** | Checks integrity rules and user permissions during database access. Also handles recovery during failures or concurrent transaction control. |
| **Stored Data Manager** | Manages access to user data and the system catalog stored on disk, interfacing with the OS file manager.   |

## Section 2: Evolution and Types of Databases

### 2.1 Historical Context and Evolution

*   **Origin (Late 1960s):** Databases were created to manage data more efficiently than simple file systems.
*   **Early Evolution:** Basic models evolved from **Network** to **Relational**, then **Object-Oriented**, and currently, **Object-Relational** is most widely used.
*   **Shift in Focus:** Initially, focus was on internal data models. Now, **performance and scalability** are critical due to massive data growth, leading to new types like **column-type** databases and **NoSQL**.

### 2.2 Why Understand Database Types?

Understanding the development and basic concepts of major database types helps:
*   Grasp the functions and purposes of various DBMSs in different workplaces.
*   Strategically select the optimal DBMS for specific business needs and characteristics.
*   Traditional **Relational** and **Object-Relational** databases were key for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) where data consistency is vital. Modern needs for diverse, large-scale data processing drive the adoption of new types.

### 2.3 Database Development Timeline (Simplified)

*   **1960s:** File System → **Hierarchical DBMS**
*   **Early 1970s:** **Network DBMS**
*   **1970s:** **Relational DBMS (RDB)** (solved consistency issues of earlier models)
*   **1990s:** **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODB)** (for complex/multimedia data, beyond RDB's capabilities)
*   **Later:** **Object-Relational DBMS (ORDB)** (combining RDB & OODB advantages)
*   **2000s onwards:** **XML DBMS, NoSQL** (for Internet environments, Big Data, large capacity, complex business support)

## Section 3: Detailed Database Types

### 3.1 Hierarchical Database

*   **Structure:** Stores data in a tree-like, hierarchical format (parent-child relationships).
*   **Origin:** Oldest database type (1960s).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Uses physical pointers to maintain dependent relationships.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Rapid data access.
    *   Easy to predict data usage.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Difficult to adapt to changing business processes.
    *   Challenging to modify the data structure after initial setup.
    *   Poor performance for unexpected or random searches.

### 3.2 Network Database

*   **Structure:** Expands the hierarchical tree into a network, allowing more complex relationships.
*   **Origin:** Developed in the early 1970s to address limitations of hierarchical databases.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Uses pointers to establish many-to-many relationships between records.
    *   A record can point to children, siblings, AND parent records.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Quicker and more effective data extraction by adding links.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   High maintenance costs due to complex system.
    *   Programmers need a deep understanding of the database structure to write applications.

### 3.3 Relational Database (RDB)

*   **Basis:** Founded on the relational data model proposed by E.F. Codd in the 1970s.
*   **Examples:** Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Informix, Sybase, Ingres.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Simple Model:** Data is stored in a two-dimensional structure (tables with columns and rows).
    *   **Mathematical Foundation:** Based on set theory, allowing for mathematical prediction, verification, and optimization of system performance.
    *   **Query Language (SQL):** Features a simple query language (like SQL - Structured Query Language) that is easy for users to learn for data retrieval and manipulation.
    *   **Modern Technology Support:** Continuously supports evolving technologies like client/server architecture and large-scale parallel processing.

### 3.4 Object-Oriented Database (OODB)

*   **Purpose:** Emerged to handle limitations of RDBs, specifically:
    *   RDBs struggle with new data types, expanding existing types, and processing unstructured complex information (e.g., multimedia).
    *   SQL's value-based relationship expression makes it hard to manage complex, interrelated objects.
*   **Concept:** Stores and searches information based on an **object model**, similar to object-oriented programming.
*   **Examples:** ObjectStore, O2, Objectivity, Uni-SQL.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Supports **user-defined data types** and **inheritance**.
    *   Can model **unstructured complex information**.
    *   Data access is based on **navigation** using reference structures between objects.
    *   The structure of information in the program aligns with the database schema.
*   **Limitations (Why not widely adopted):**
    *   Weak fundamental database management features (e.g., transaction processing, concurrent user support, backup, recovery).
    *   Lack of proven system safety and performance in large enterprise environments.

ll. Understanding  Types of Databases
>> Recent  trends and major issues
The “database”  was created  in the late 1960s to manage  and use data more efficiently  than the computer
environment  which used the file system in the early days. Since then, the basic model of database  has
evolved  continuously  into relational,  object-oriented,  and object relational  types of database,  having  started
as a network  model. Currently,  the object relational  model is the most widely used model in the market.
In addition,  the internal data model and the structure  of the database  were a matter of interest  in the
past. However,  the importance  of database  processing  performance  was highlighted with regard to the
processing  of large-scale  data, as the problem of performance  degradation became  increasingly  serious
due to the rapid increase  in the amount  of digital data. Accordingly,  the relevant  technology  has expanded
to include  new types of databases,  such as the column-type  database  which places emphasis  on database
performance  and scalability  rather  than data relations,  NoSQL,  etc.
1. To be able to explain the data model and the structure  of each type of database.
2. To be able to explain the concept  and characteristics  of the object relational  database  (ORDB).
3. To be able to understand  and write an XML document.
4. To be able to explain  various  database  systems.

+ Preview  for practical  business Reasons  to understand  database  types
The relational  database  and the object relational  database,  which are based on EF. Codd’s normalization
theory  of 1970, have mainly been used in the existing  workplace,  because  data consistency  was important
in workplaces  where OLTP (Online Transaction  Processing)  jobs were dominant.  However,  the processing
of diverse types of data and the rapid processing  of large quantities  of data are required  these days.
Therefore,  DBMS vendors  are developing  DBMS functions  in such a way that the advantages  of each type
of database  can be introduced  and applied.
As a result, if we know the background  to database  development  and the basic concepts  of the major
types of database,  we can easily understand  the functions  and purposes  of the various DBMSs used for
various purposes  in the workplace  and get help in strategically  selecting  a DBMS that is optimized  for the
characteristics  and purposes  of the business  in question.
