section  explains  the part of tailoring  that has to do with software  adoption.
Before software  is adopted,  the adoption  procedure,  method,  and outputs must be optimized  to accommodate
changes  in the internal and external  requirements.  The need for tailoring  becomes  most acute for unit-level  projects.
In these situations,  the best software  adoption  environment  can be created  through  tailoring.

03 IT Business  Adoption  Method
There are two distinct methods  of adopting  an IT business:  in-house  development  and package  purchase.  The
advantage  of in-house  development  is that it allows a company  to fully reflect the needs of users by utilizing  its own
internal personnel.  A purchased  package  has the advantage  of being based on a standardized  advanced  process
which is conducive  to improving  work efficiency.
@ Characteristics  of in-house  development
This is a form of adoption  that allows companies  to set up and develop  information  systems  using their own
manpower,  resulting  in a system  that is faithful to the internal  requirements  of the company.  While know-how  can be
accumulated  with this method,  it involves  relatively  higher adoption  costs, while success  cannot  be guaranteed.
