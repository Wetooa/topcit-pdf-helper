## Project Management & Technical Communication Learning Guide

This guide covers core concepts in Project Management, focusing on Agile methods, PMBOK knowledge areas, and an in-depth look at Scope Management.

### Section 1: Introduction to Project Management Methodologies

#### A. Agile Methodologies
*   **Core Principles:**
    *   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
    *   Responding to change over following a plan.
*   **Examples:** Scrum, XP (Extreme Programming), Kanban.
*   **Scrum:**
    *   Most representative agile method, emerged 1995 (Ken Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland).
    *   A mutually progressive development methodology for project management.
*   **Scrum Process Steps:**
    1.  Sprint Planning
    2.  Daily Scrum (daily meetings)
    3.  Sprint Review
    4.  Sprint Retrospective
*   **Key Scrum Deliverables:**
    *   Product Backlog
    *   Sprint Backlog
    *   Burndown Charts (used for quality management and tracking progress)

#### B. PMBOK and ISO 21500 Methodology
*   **Framework:** A project management framework.
*   **Structure:** Divided into:
    *   5 Process Groups
    *   10 Knowledge Areas
    *   49 Detailed Processes

### Section 2: PMBOK Project Knowledge Areas

The PMBOK defines 10 key areas vital for project management:

1.  **Project Integration Management:** Manages processes to identify, define, and coordinate all project activities.
2.  **Scope Management:** Manages project initiation, planning, and controlling activities; defines customer requirements and designs WBS.
3.  **Schedule Management:** Develops and manages the project schedule by understanding activity relationships and resource allocation to complete the project on time.
4.  **Cost Management:** Manages cost planning, calculation, budgeting, and controlling to complete the project within the approved budget.
5.  **Resource Management:** Secures and utilizes project resources effectively and efficiently.
6.  **Communication Management:** Manages creating, collecting, storing, distributing, controlling, and monitoring project information for stakeholders.
7.  **Quality Management:** Manages activities related to quality planning, assurance, and control to meet project requirements.
8.  **Procurement Management:** Manages activities including procurement contracts, change control, and contract closing for external products/services.
9.  **Risk Management:** Identifies, analyzes, and responds to potential project risks to increase success likelihood.
10. **Stakeholder Management:** Identifies all influential people/organizations and develops strategies to manage their expectations and interests.

### Section 3: Scope Management - Deep Dive

#### A. Recent Trends & Major Issues
*   **Biggest Cause of Project Failure:** Scope change due to repetitive requirements changes.
*   **Impact:** Leads to schedule delays and higher costs (e.g., overtime).
*   **Solution:** Effective scope management process is crucial for success.

#### B. Key Concepts
*   **Scope Management Process Steps:**
    1.  Scope Management Plan Formation
    2.  Requirements Collection
    3.  Scope Definition
    4.  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Creation
    5.  Scope Validation
    6.  Scope Control
*   **WBS Techniques:** Segmented, Integrated Planning
*   **WBS Components:** Work Package, Code of Account, WBS Dictionary

#### C. Understanding Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
*   **Common Misconception:** WBS is often mistaken as a schedule management tool (because work packages have start/end dates and tools like MS Project integrate it with scheduling).
*   **Clarification:** WBS is a **deliverable of Scope Management**, explicitly defined in PMBOK's "Create WBS" process.
*   **Why the Distinction Matters:** WBS plays a critical role in managing scope changes. When requirements change, WBS is the first place to look, allowing comprehensive management of related impacts on schedule, cost, and quality.
*   **Focus:** Use WBS as a tool for **scope management**.

#### D. Concept of Scope Management
*   **Importance:** It's one of the three most important knowledge areas for project success.
*   **Purpose:** Since projects are unique, temporary, and goal-driven, clear goals and scope are essential.
*   **Project Manager's Role:** Clarify and define the work scope—what needs to be done, and what is unnecessary, even if requested.
*   **Definition of Scope:**
    *   "The sum of products and services provided through the project."
    *   The range of work required to successfully complete the project.
*   **Types of Scope:**
    1.  **Project Scope:**
        *   **Definition:** All the work required to create products, services, and outputs with specified features/functions.
        *   **Focus:** The "HOW" aspect – how products and services are provided.
        *   **Completion Measured By:** Project plan.
    2.  **Product Scope:**
        *   **Definition:** The features and functions of the product or service itself.
        *   **Focus:** The "WHAT" aspect – what the product/service is.
        *   **Completion Measured By:** Product requirements.
*   **Equation:** Scope = Project Scope + Product Scope

#### E. Scope Management Process (Detailed Steps)

The scope management process follows a specific order:

1.  **Scope Management Planning**
    *   **Concept:** Developing a Project Scope Management Plan to define, confirm, and control the project scope.
    *   **Project Scope Management Plan Content:**
        *   Procedure to describe project scope.
        *   How to formulate the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
        *   Verification and validation criteria for deliverables.
        *   Format and procedure for requesting scope changes.
    *   **Key Requirement:** The plan must be shared between the client and the service provider.

2.  **Collect Requirements**
    *   **Importance:** Crucial to understand *what* the customer needs and, more importantly, *why* they need it.
    *   **Example (F-16 Fighter Jet):**
        *   Initial Requirement: Mach 2.5 speed.
        *   Underlying Need (Why?): Improve engagement capabilities.
        *   Solution: Designer focused on maneuverability (fly-by-wire, integrated canopy, digital avionics) instead of just speed, successfully meeting the *true* requirement.
        *   *Contrast (Soviet Jets):* Focus solely on "fastest in world" (Mach 3.25) led to an expensive, short-lived, and ineffective combat aircraft.
    *   **Lesson:** Prioritize understanding the root need over literal stated requirements.

Project Management  and Technical  Communication  )
+ Customer  collaboration  over contract  negotiation
+ Responding  to change  over following  a plan
According  to this agile spirit, various methodologies  such as Scrum, XP, and Kanban emerged.  Scrum, the
most representative  agile method,  first appeared  in 1995 when it was adopted  in software  development  by
Ken Schwaber  and Jeff Sutherland.  It is a mutually  progressive  development  methodology  for project  manage-
ment.
The Scrum process  consists  of sprint planning,  daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective,  and the
main deliverables  include  product  backlog,  sprint backlog,  and burndown  charts.
Daily scrum meetings  or sprint-level  reviews are held to manage  project quality through repetitive  reviews.
One of the most common  deliverables  is burndown  charts.
C) Project  management  area
The PMBOK and ISO 21500 methodology  is a framework  of project management,  which is divided  into five
process  groups, 10 knowledge  areas, and 49 detailed  processes.  The ten knowledge  areas are shown in the
figure below.

[Figure  25] Project  Knowledge  Areas
In addition  to brief explanations  for each knowledge  area, the main knowledge  areas such as scope manage-
ment, schedule  management,  cost management,  quality management,  and risk management  will be examined
in detail from the next chapter.

Project  Management  and Technical  Communication
>> Recent  Trends  and Major Issues
The biggest  cause of project failure is scope change caused by repetitive  requirements  changes.
Frequent  scope change in and after mid-project  delays the schedule,  which in turn leads to higher
costs such as hiring or paying overtime.  For the successful  execution  of a project, it is necessary
to understand  the scope management  process  that collects  requirements  and defines, verifies and
controls  scope.
>> Learning  Objectives
1. To be able to explain the concept  and process  of scope management.
2. To be able to explain  the concept  of Work Breakdown  Structure  (WBS).
>> Keywords
+ Scope management  process: Scope management  plan formation,  requirements  collection,  scope
definition,  work breakdown  system  creation,  scope validation,  scope control
+ WBS techniques:  Segmented,  integrated  planning
+ WBS components:  Work Package,  Code of Account,  WBS D...
