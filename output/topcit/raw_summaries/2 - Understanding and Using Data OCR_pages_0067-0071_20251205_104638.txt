# Database Concepts: Integrity, Keys, and Normalization

## 1. Data Integrity

Data integrity ensures data quality and consistency within a database.

### Types of Integrity:

1.  **Entity Integrity:**
    *   Ensures that a primary key (PK) is unique and not NULL.
    *   No two rows can have the same PK value.
    *   Each row must have a unique identifier.
2.  **Referential Integrity:**
    *   Ensures consistency between related tables (parent-child relationship).
    *   A foreign key (FK) in a child table must refer to an existing primary key value in the parent table, or be NULL.
    *   **Example:** If a `Use History` record refers to a `Credit Card` number, that `Credit Card` record cannot be deleted or changed if `Use History` still references it.
3.  **User-Defined Integrity:**
    *   Specific business rules defined by the user that don't fit into other integrity categories.

## 2. Keys in Databases

Keys are attributes or sets of attributes used to uniquely identify records and establish relationships.

*   **Super Key:**
    *   A subset of all fields in a table.
    *   An attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
*   **Candidate Key:**
    *   A super key that is unique and minimal.
    *   "Minimal" means if you remove any attribute from it, it loses its uniqueness.
    *   Candidates for the Primary Key.
*   **Primary Key (PK):**
    *   A unique identifier chosen from the candidate keys to distinguish a specific record.
    *   Must be unique and minimal (like a candidate key).
    *   **Cannot be NULL.**
    *   **Selection Criteria (if multiple candidate keys):**
        *   Choose a field whose values are **not frequently changed**. (Frequent changes require uniqueness checks).
        *   Choose a field whose values are **relatively simple and short** (less complex data domain for efficient comparison).
*   **Foreign Key (FK):**
    *   An attribute or set of attributes in one table (Table A) that refers to a primary key (or unique key) in another table (Table B).
    *   Establishes a link between Table A and Table B.
    *   Can have duplicate values or NULL values (unless restricted by specific constraints).
    *   Must refer to a field with a unique value in Table B.

## 3. Database Normalization

Normalization is a fundamental theory for building stable and efficient database systems.

### A. Core Concept & Importance

*   **Purpose:** Removes data redundancy and associated anomalies to ensure stable data management.
*   **Foundation:** The starting point is First Normal Form (1NF), which addresses basic data duplication.
*   **Types of Normalization:**
    *   **Based on Functional Dependency:** 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
    *   **Based on Semantic Association:** 4NF, 5NF.
*   **Normalization vs. Denormalization:**
    *   **Normalization:** Removes anomalies by removing data redundancy.
    *   **Denormalization:** A design technique to intentionally introduce redundancy to improve query performance (done carefully, post-normalization).

### B. Practical Utilization in Business

Normalization is crucial for developers in two ways:

1.  **Internalized Design Thinking:**
    *   Developers who understand normalization intuitively apply its principles when modeling data, even if not following a strict step-by-step process.
    *   This leads to better initial designs, recognizing functional dependencies naturally.
2.  **Data Model Verification:**
    *   Used as a tool to verify the completeness and stability of a designed data model.
    *   Helps identify "normalization violations" in large, complex data models, preventing data integrity issues later.

## 4. Anomalies Caused by Poor Design

Poor database design, especially without considering attribute dependencies, can lead to various anomalies during data operations.

### Types of Anomalies:

1.  **Insertion Anomaly:**
    *   **Definition:** Unintended information must be inserted when trying to insert specific information.
    *   **Example (Mixed Student/Department Table):** To add a new department (`Management Information`, `Management Building`), you'd also have to create a new student record for that department, or the `Student ID` (PK) would be NULL, violating entity integrity.
2.  **Deletion Anomaly:**
    *   **Definition:** Necessary information is unintentionally deleted when deleting certain information.
    *   **Example (Mixed Student/Department Table):** If student `3333` (Physics Department) is the *only* student in that department, deleting their record also deletes the `Physics Department`'s office location (`Natural Science Building`).
3.  **Update Anomaly:**
    *   **Definition:** The same content must be updated multiple times across several data records when modifying information.
    *   **Example (Mixed Student/Department Table):** If the `Computer Engineering` department office changes to `Future Building`, every student record belonging to `Computer Engineering` must be individually updated.

---

## 5. Functional Dependency & Inference

Functional dependency is a key criterion for decomposing tables to prevent anomalies.

### A. Functional Dependency (FD)

*   **Definition:** For a table R, if a set of attributes X uniquely determines a set of attributes Y, then Y is **functionally dependent** on X.
*   **Expression:** `X → Y` (Y is functionally dependent on determinant X).
*   **Example:** `(Resident Registration Number) → (Name)`
    *   If two records have the same resident registration number, they must have the same name.

### B. Types of Functional Dependency (Relevant for Normal Forms)

*   **Full Functional Dependency (used in 2NF):**
    *   An attribute Y is fully functionally dependent on X if Y is functionally dependent on X, AND Y is not functionally dependent on any proper subset of X.
    *   **Partial Functional Dependency:** Occurs when Y *is* dependent on a proper subset of X (problematic for 2NF).
*   **Transitive Dependency (used in 3NF):**
    *   Occurs when attributes A, X, and Y exist in a relation R, such that `A → X` and `X → Y`, implying `A → Y`.
    *   This is problematic if X is not a candidate key.
    *   **Example:** `(Supplier Number) → (Place of Location)` and `(Place of Location) → (Transport Distance)` implies `(Supplier Number) → (Transport Distance)`.
*   **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**
    *   A stricter form of 3NF.
    *   For every functional dependency `X → Y`, X must be a candidate key.

© User-defined  integrity:  A specific  work rule, which does not fall into other integrity  categories,  is defined.
B) Key
© Super key: A sub-set  of all fields in a table. It is an attribute  or set of attributes  that can uniquely  identify  a record.
@ Candidate  key: A candidate  for the primary  key. It is a super key that satisfies  uniqueness  and minimality.  That is, if
any attribute  is removed  from a super key, the super key loses its nature and becomes  a candidate  key.
@ Primary  key: A unique identifier  selected  from among  candidate  keys to distinguish  a specific  record in the table. Like
the candidate  key, the primary  key has the attribute of  uniqueness  and minimality,  but a null value is not allowed. If
there are multiple  candidate  keys, a primary  key is selected  by considering  the following  two points.
+ Selecting  a field in which values  are not frequently  changed:  Each time the value of the field selected  as the primary
is changed,  it should be checked  whether  the value concerned  is a unique value or not. Therefore,  a column  without
frequent  change  is more suitable.
+ Selecting  a field in which values are not relatively  complex:  If a field selected  as a primary  key has a complex  data
domain,  the cost of comparing  the primary  key increases.  Therefore,  it is more suitable to select a domain with a
relatively  short and simple form.
@ Foreign key: When Table A refers to Table B, the foreign key of Table A refers to a key that can uniquely  identify  a
record of Table B. A foreign key consists  of one field or a subset  of all fields, and cannot  have duplicate  values or a null
value. Also, you must refer to a field that has a unique  value in Table B.

>> Recent  trends and major issues
The “normalization”  theory is the foundation  of completing  a system and is one of the most important
theories  that need to be understood  when building  a system in the field. The theory  of first normalization  is
the starting  point for normalization,  which removes  duplication  from a file system  in order that data can be
processed  stably. This situation  occurs frequently  in the actual project site, so it is necessary  to learn the
details in depth. The first, second,  and third Boyce-Codd  normalizations  are performed  based on function
dependency,  whereas  the fourth and fifth normalizations  are performed by  the semantic  association
between  attributes.  Data should be managed  stably when building  a system.  Normalization  is an important
theory that everyone  should know when developing  an information  system, because  normalization  is the
most important  and basic theory  for ensuring  stable data management.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to explain the concept  and characteristics  of file dependency.
2. To be able to explain abnormal  normalization.
3. To be able to design a database  by applying  normalization.
4. To be able to explain denormalization.
5. To be able to explain the points to be taken into consideration  for performance  design.
+ Normalization  removes  anomalies  by removing  data redundancy.
+ Denormalization  is a design technique  for improving  query performance,

+ Preview  for practical  business How should normalization  be utilized in an
actual project?
It is quite rare that data modeling  is performed  as a series of tasks, such as identifying  entities  through
normalization,  and setting  and diversifying  the relationship.  It is also rare to prove an anomaly  by assigning
functional  dependency  to each table, as we did when learning  the theory of normalization.  Why, then, is it
so important  that we should learn the theory  of normalization  and remember  the theory  of normalization?
Learning  and utilizing  normalization  for practical  business  can be summarized  into two points.
The first point is that those who learn the theory of normalization  accurately  can identify  objects and
establish  a relationship  based on the idea of normalization,  even though normalization  is not performed
according  to the normalization  procedure.
That is, even though  data modeling  is not performed  according  to the process  of normalization,  those who
perform data modeling  are clearly aware of the theory...
