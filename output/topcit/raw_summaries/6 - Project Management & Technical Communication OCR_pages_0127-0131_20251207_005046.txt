### Section 2: Project Risk Management

#### 2.1 Introduction & Importance

*   **Trends:** Systematic and effective risk management is crucial for sustainable business growth and successful project completion.
*   **Business Impact:** Company survival can depend on managing potential large losses from unexpected risks.
*   **Implementation:** Requires enterprise-level guidelines, continuous effectiveness measurement, and integration with policies, processes, roles, systems, and culture, rather than being a one-time or departmental effort.

#### 2.2 Key Concepts & Definitions

*   **Project Risk:** An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on project objectives (e.g., scope, schedule, cost, quality).
*   **Risk Management:** The process of defining how to manage risks in a project, including identifying risk levels, types, and their potential impacts.

#### 2.3 Types of Risks

| Feature                 | **Known Risk**                                      | **Unknown Risk**                                      |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**             | Can be identified in advance.                       | Cannot be identified in advance.                      |
| **Reserve Allocation**  | **Contingency Reserve:** Allocated per work package; managed by project. | **Management Reserve:** ~10% of total project cost; managed by senior management outside the project. |
| **Reserve Calculation** | Expected value of probability & impact.             | Percentage of total budget.                           |
| **Countermeasure**      | Establish and execute a specific risk response plan. | Ad-hoc (as needed).                                   |

#### 2.4 Risk Management Process Overview

Generally carried out in four stages:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Primary risk recognition, categorization, profiling.
2.  **Risk Analysis:** Evaluate based on probability and impact; assess financial/organizational response.
3.  **Risk Response:** Plan actions to avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept risks.
4.  **Risk Control:** Observe risk response, ongoing assessment, early warning system.

#### 2.5 Risk Response Strategies (Summary from Learning Objectives)

*   **Negative Risks (Threats):**
    *   **Avoid:** Eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact.
    *   **Transfer:** Shift the responsibility for the risk and its impact to a third party.
    *   **Mitigate:** Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.
    *   **Acceptance:** Acknowledge the risk and decide not to take any action unless it occurs.
*   **Positive Risks (Opportunities):**
    *   **Exploit:** Maximize the probability or impact of an opportunity.
    *   **Share:** Allocate ownership of an opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the benefit.
    *   **Enhance:** Increase the probability or impact of an opportunity.
    *   **Acceptance:** Acknowledge the opportunity and decide not to take any action to pursue it.

#### 2.6 A) Risk Identification

*   **Purpose:** To find and document potential risks that may affect the project as early as possible.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Prioritize legally binding elements (contract scope, schedule).
    *   Cross-check contracts, proposals, and project execution plans for omissions (omissions can violate acceptance criteria).
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Documentation Reviews:** Examine plans, assumptions, previous project files, contracts.
    *   **Information Gathering Techniques:** Brainstorming, Delphi Technique, interviews, root cause analysis.
    *   **Checklist Analysis:** Use precedents, accumulated knowledge from similar projects, or a Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS).
    *   **Assumption Analysis:** Evaluate the validity of project assumptions for inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness.
    *   **Diagramming Techniques:** Use visual aids like Cause and Effect Diagrams, System/Process Flow Diagrams, or Interrelationship Diagrams.
    *   **SWOT Analysis:** Investigate Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to expand the scope of identified risks, including internal ones.
    *   **Expert Judgment:** Obtain input from experts with similar project or business experience.
*   **Risk Register:**
    *   **Key Output:** A document used to record, track, and manage identified risks systematically.
    *   **Content:** Includes risk ID, item, probability, impact, exposure, priority, countermeasure, and manager.
    *   **Usage:** Identified risks are registered, then analyzed (qualitative/quantitative) to prioritize for response planning.

#### 2.7 B) Risk Analysis: Qualitative Risk Analysis

*   **Purpose:** To qualitatively assess the impact of a risk on the project and prioritize risks based on their probability and impact.
*   **Probability-Impact Matrix:** A technique to evaluate and display the probability of a risk's occurrence and its impact on project objectives in a matrix format.
    *   **Risk Level Calculation:** Risk Level = Probability of Occurrence (P) × Degree of Impact (I).
    *   **Scales (Example):**
        *   Probability: Very low (0.1) to very high (0.9).
        *   Impact: Very low (0.1) to very high (0.8).
    *   **Prioritization:** The calculated risk levels are then ranked (e.g., low, moderate, high) to determine risk prioritization.

+ Preview  for practical business
Risk management  is a very attractive  business  management  technique considering  that the very
survival of a company  depends  on potential  large losses caused by unexpected  risks. For the
activation  and effective  application  of risk management,  an execution  guideline  that reflects the
characteristics  of the company  must be established,  and its effectiveness  must be continuously
measured  to manage performance,  and risk management  process must be established  at the
enterprise  level, rather  than at the individual  department  level.
It must not be a one-time  project and should be done organically  in consideration  of policies,
management  processes,  definition  of related roles and responsibilities,  support  systems  and culture,
etc.
01 Concept  of Risk Management
Project risk refers to a situation  in which uncertain  events or conditions  occur that negatively  or positively
affect project  goals, such as scope, schedule,  cost, and quality.
Risk management  is a process that defines how to manage risks occurring  in such  a project, is an activity
in which the level and type of risk management,  and risks and their impacts  are identified  by the project
organization.  The types of risk are as follow...
