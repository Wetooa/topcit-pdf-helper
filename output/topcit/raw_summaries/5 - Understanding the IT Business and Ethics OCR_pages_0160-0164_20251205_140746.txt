### 3. Latest IT Business Services

#### 3.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

*   **Definition (Modern):** The method of making computers or machines mimic human intelligence (cognition, inference, learning), or the technology researching its feasibility.
*   **Original Definition (John McCarthy, 1956):** Making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.
*   **Everyday Examples:**
    *   **Translation Services:** Google Translator, Naver Translator (using artificial neural networks).
    *   **Image Classification/Machine Vision:** Kakao's flower search, Naver's smart lens, Google Lens.
    *   **Other Services:** Music recognition, watermark removal, auto-draw.

#### 3.1.1 Key AI Technologies

*   **Characteristics:** Ability to reason, generality, vastness, inaccuracy, knowledge use.
*   **Current Focus Areas:** Pattern recognition, machine learning, and deep learning.

#### 3.1.2 Pattern Recognition

*   **Definition:** The process of separating learned data into multiple groups based on specific criteria of input values.
*   **Stages:**
    1.  **Learning Stage:** Extract key information for distinguishing patterns by analyzing characteristics of a given dataset.
    2.  **Recognition Stage:** Classify and recognize new data using the patterns identified during the learning stage.

#### 3.1.3 Machine Learning

*   **Definition:** The field of developing algorithms that enable machines to learn. It's about systems autonomously improving performance using empirical data gathered through environmental interaction.
*   **Main Categories:**
    *   **1. Supervised Learning:** Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict future outcomes.
        *   **Algorithms:**
            *   **Regression Analysis:** Models relationships between data by minimizing error margins.
            *   **Decision Tree:** Generates a tree-shaped model to derive decisions based on data properties.
            *   **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Mimics biological neural networks (input, hidden, output layers) by updating node weights.
            *   **Bayes Theorem:** Applies Bayes theorem (assuming independence) for classification and prediction.
            *   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds the optimal decision boundary using margins.
    *   **2. Unsupervised Learning:** Learns from unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures.
        *   **Algorithms:**
            *   **Clustering:** Groups similar data points into clusters.
            *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Summarizes or represents data in a lower dimension while preserving key information.
    *   **3. Semi-supervised Learning:** Combines aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning, often using a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.
        *   **Algorithms:** Often combines supervised algorithms with clustering; Expected Value Maximization for probability models with unobserved variables.

#### 3.1.4 Deep Learning

*   **Definition:** A branch of machine learning responsible for recent AI advancements. It solves problems similarly to humans using multi-layered artificial neural networks.
*   **Basis:** Human neural network theory.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Consolidated Feature Extraction:** Pre-processing and feature extraction steps are integrated into the overall learning process.
    *   **Automatic Complex Data Information Extraction:** Reduces information loss when processing high-dimensional, complex data (e.g., images).
    *   **Efficient for High-Level Abstractions:** Improved ability to absorb large and complex datasets by scaling high-efficiency simulations.

#### 3.2 Use of Big Data

*   **Definition:** Data sets so large and complex that traditional data storage, management, and analysis methods are insufficient. They exceed the limits of general databases.
*   **Challenges:** Difficult to quantify using conventional methods due to its defining "3Vs":
    *   **Volume:** Extremely large size (e.g., petabytes, billions of records).
    *   **Variety:** Diverse data types (unstructured, non-formal, distributed data, simple correlation with plain schema).
    *   **Velocity:** Data generated at high speed and often time-sensitive (e.g., system logs, sensor data, SNS data).
*   **Representation:** Often visualized using specialized tools.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Google "Flu Trends" (2008):** Predicted flu outbreaks by analyzing popular search queries related to flu and cold, along with user locations.
    *   **Credit Card Companies:** Analyze customer consumption and behavioral data for marketing, product development, and personalized recommendations.

+ Digital textbooks
Digital textbooks  contains  the digital versions  of the contents  in existing  paper textbooks  and adds videos,
interactive functions,  and automatic  scoring  functions.  For example,  a digital textbook  could show moving images
of molecular  action between  liquids, solids, and gases, or an image of the Earth from outer space that zooms out by
moving  scrolling  key.
@ Smart health care
Smart healthcare  is a field that combines  digital devices  and IT devices  that connote  ‘smart’ and ‘healthcare’  which
refers to medical services.  Smart healthcare  is anticipated  to make a great leap forward  when it gets combined  with
loT, cloud computing,  Big Data, and Al, the so called core technologies  of the 4th Industrial  Revolution.  Therefore,
if interpreted  another  way, in smart health care, there is a set of data that are produced  by or measured  from
consumers  or patients.  Collecting  this data and analyzing  them using techniques  like Big Data are the specialized
firms. Then, based on the findings,  medical  institutions  provide  services  to consumers.
