### 3. Personal Information Infringement: Response Methods

#### 3.1 Proactive Measures for Personal Information Controllers

**A) Technical/Administrative Protection of Personal Information**

*   **Administrative Protection:**

    *   Install and operate access control systems (intrusion prevention/detection/blocking).
    *   Apply encryption to personal information databases (DB).
    *   Store access records and prevent forgery/alteration.
    *   Install and operate security programs.

#### 3.2 Characteristics & Causes of Personal Information Infringement

| Sector     | Characteristics                                            | Causes                                                      | Occurrence                                                                  |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 4. De-identification Process of Personal Data

**De-identification:** Processing personal information with alternative methods (e.g., pseudonymization, aggregation, deletion, categorization, data masking) to remove elements that can identify an individual, making it impossible to link data to a specific person. This is crucial for businesses wanting to process information for data analysis.

#### 4.1 De-identification Standards

*   **Identifiers:**
    *   As a rule, identifiers in datasets should be deleted.
    *   If absolutely needed for data use, they must be de-identified.
*   **Attribute Values:**
    *   Remove attribute values irrelevant to data use.
    *   Strict de-identification for unique attributes (e.g., rare diseases, unique professional experiences) as they carry a high risk of re-identification.

#### 4.2 De-identification Process Flow
1.  **Personal Information:** Start with identifiable data.
2.  **De-identification:** Apply de-identification methods.
3.  **Evaluation:** Assess if the de-identification is adequate.
4.  **Adequacy Check:**
    *   **Yes (Adequate):** Information is deemed non-privacy, elements removed.
    *   **No (Inadequate):** Re-identify, re-process, or block if identification of a particular individual (or easy combination with other info) is still possible.

#### 4.3 Examples of Personal Information Identifiers

**A) Attribute Values (General Characteristics)**
*   **Personal:** Gender, age, nationality, hometown, city/county, zip code, military service, marital status, religion, hobbies, clubs, smoking, drinking, vegetarianism, concerns.
*   **Physical:** Blood type, height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, eye color, medical examination results, disability type/level.
*   **Credit:** Tax payment, credit rating, donation, health insurance premiums, income quintile, medical aid beneficiaries.
*   **Educational/Career:** School name, department, grade, academic background, career, job type, company name, department, position, former workplace.
*   **Electronic:** Cookie information, access/visit date, service use record, internet access records, mobile phone usage records, GPS data.
*   **Family:** Spouse, children, parents, siblings, legal representative information.

**B) Unique Identifiers (Directly Identifying Information)**
*   **Unique Identification Info:** Resident registration number, passport number, alien registration number, driver's license number.
*   **Name:** Chinese/English name, pen name.
*   **Detailed Address:** Address up to the district (gu) unit.
*   **Date Information:** Birthday (solar/lunar), anniversary (marriage, first birthday, sixtieth birthday), certificate dates.
*   **Phone Number:** Mobile, home, company, fax numbers.
*   **Medical/Health Info:** Medical record number, health insurance number, welfare recipient number.
*   **Account/Card Number:** Account number, credit card number.
*   **Qualifications/Licenses:** Various qualification and license numbers.
*   **Vehicle/Device Numbers:** Vehicle number, registration number, serial number of various devices.
*   **Photos:** Still photos, videos, CCTV footage.
*   **Body Identification Info:** Fingerprint, voice, iris.
*   **Email/Network Address:** Email address, IP address, Mac address, homepage URL.
*   **Identification Code:** ID, employee number, customer number.
*   **Other Unique Numbers:** Military serial number, business registration number (sole proprietorship).

#### 4.4 Methods of De-identification
Various methods can be used individually or combined. The choice depends on data usage purpose and method strengths/weaknesses.

**Examples of De-identification Methods:**
*   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing direct identifiers with artificial identifiers.
    *   **Example:** "Hong Gil-dong, 35, Seoul, Korea University" -> "Lim Kkeokjeong, 30s, Seoul, International University".
    *   **Technologies:** Heuristic pseudonymization, encryption, hashing, wrapping.
*   **Aggregation:** Combining data to prevent individual identification.
    *   **Example:** Individual heights (180cm, 170cm, 160cm, 150cm) -> "Sum of height among physics major students: 660cm, average height: 165cm."
    *   **Technologies:** K-anonymity, L-diversity, T-closeness, micro-aggregation, rounding.
*   **Data Reduction (Suppression/Deletion):** Removing or reducing parts of the data.
    *   **Example:** Resident registration number "901206-71234567" -> "90's born, male."
    *   **Example:** Date information (e.g., date of final pass) processed annually instead of specific dates.
    *   **Technologies:** Rearrangement, identifier deletion (complete/partial), reducing records.

The EU's GDPR reinforces  the rights of data subjects  compared  to existing  data protection  guidelines  by newly
guaranteeing  the right to be forgotten  and the right to transfer  data, and strictly restricts  the transfer  of data of EU
citizens  abroad.
The main items to guarantee  the rights of data subjects  in GDPR are as follows.
+ the right to be informed
+ the right of access
+ the right to rectification
+ the right to erasure
+ the right to restrict  processing
+ the right to data portability
+ the right to object
+ rights in relation to automated  decision  making  and profiling
The right to erasure (right to request  erasure)  has been renamed  from the right to forgotten  in the previous  GDPR
draft, and the right to erasure  and the right to data portability  are items that reinforce  the rights of data subjects.
The rights in relation  to automated  decision  making  and profiling  refer to the right to notify the user who is the data
subject  and to let them decide whether  their information  will be used or not, when an individual's  occupation,  hobbies,
and location  are automatically  collected  and used as part of marketing.
