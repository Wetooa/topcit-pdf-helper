### 2. Main IoT Protocols

IoT protocols require lightweight design, compatibility, and scalability. **CoAP** and **MQTT** are especially suitable for small, internet-connected devices.

1.  **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol):**
    *   **Type:** Lightweight application layer protocol for object communication.
    *   **Developed by:** IETF CORE Working Group.
    *   **Transport Layer:** Uses UDP (above IP layer), but designed to be independent of lower layers.
    *   **Design Features:** Reduced message size, uses binary encoding for efficient processing.
    *   **Usage:** Popular for communicating with endpoints via technologies like Zigbee, rather than just fast Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
    *   **Topology:** 1:1 (Server and client).
    *   **Operation:** Requesting and responding.
    *   **Data Type:** Status Information.
    *   **Standard:** IETF CoRE.
2.  **MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport):**
    *   **Type:** Publish-subscribe-based protocol.
    *   **Purpose:** Delivers lightweight messages at low speed, suitable for high-latency and unreliable networks.
    *   **Operation:**
        *   Clients **publish** messages to specific **topics**.
        *   Other clients **subscribe** to topics to receive messages.
        *   An **MQTT Broker** facilitates message distribution between publishers and subscribers.
    *   **Topology:** N:M (many-to-many) type, using a broker and multiple clients.
    *   **Operation:** Publishing and subscribing.
    *   **Data Type:** Event-driven.
    *   **Transport:** Mostly uses TCP.
    *   **Standard:** OASIS.

| :------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Message protocol for IoT  | Message protocol for IoT    |
| **Topology**   | N:M type (many-to-many)   | 1:1 type                    |
| **Config.**    | Broker and multiple clients | Server and client           |
| **Operation**  | Publishing and subscribing | Requesting and responding   |
| **Data**       | Event                     | Status Information          |
| **Transport**  | Mostly TCP                | Mostly UDP                  |
| **Standard**   | OASIS standard            | IETF CoRE standard          |

## Part 2: Software-Based Network (SDN & NFV)

**SDN (Software-Defined Networks)** and **NFV (Network Function Virtualization)** are crucial technologies revolutionizing network management. They aim to open up the network market, allowing more third-party software and equipment providers to enter.

### 1. Limitations of Existing Network Environments

Traditional networks face several challenges:

*   **Changing Traffic Patterns:** Modern applications generate high traffic, accessing many servers and databases, shifting from simple client-server to complex multi-system interactions.
*   **Virtualization Impact:** Virtualization increased connected servers, complicating assumptions about physical host locations.
*   **Increased Complexity:** Networks are becoming more complex due to numerous computers and discrete protocol sets.
*   **Difficult Design & Management:** Dynamic traffic patterns make it hard to predict network size, making initial design (using link oversubscription) challenging.
*   **Dependence on Manufacturers:** The core network market is dominated by a few major equipment manufacturers, hindering the introduction of new services or technologies.

### 2. SDN (Software-Defined Network)

**Definition:** SDN is a next-generation network technology that allows network routing, control, and complex operation management to be configured and operated through software programming.

*   **Origin:** First proposed at the Open Network Summit in October 2010. Gained attention with **OpenFlow** technology.
*   **Core Concept:** SDN separates the network's control functions from its data forwarding functions.
    *   **Control Plane:** Guides network traffic, determines "where packets go."
    *   **Data Plane:** Forwards packets to their specific destinations.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   SDN uses switches that support industry-standard control protocols (like OpenFlow).
    *   These switches can be programmed by a central **SDN Controller**.
*   **OpenFlow Technology:**
    *   **Function:** Separates packet control and transfer.
    *   **Components:** Consists of a **Controller** and a **Switch**.
    *   **Operation:** The Controller issues commands to the Switch. The Switch then performs data flow tasks (e.g., sending or modifying packets to a destination) according to these commands.

[Figure 147] Standard  Scope  of Each loT Standardization  Organization  [10]
C) Core loT technologies
loT’s main technologies  are a sensing  technology,  a wired and wireless  communication  and network  infrastructure
technology,  and an loT service  and interface  technology.
@ Sensing  technology
Sensors  collect object information.  Various sensors, such as temperature,  humidity,  heat, gas, illuminance,  and
ultrasonic  waves, are installed  in the object  to obtain information  about  the surrounding  situation.  Sensors  are needed
to minimize  power consumption  in order to operate  for a long time. Physical  sensors  have evolved  into smart sensors
with a standardized  interface and information  processing  capability,  and they include  a virtual sensing  function  that
extracts  specific information  from the sensed data. As the sensor layer's role has increased,  the hardware  platform
market  is evolving  to facilitate  connecting  various sensors,  control,  and communication,  using open-source  hardware
(OSHW).
@ Wired/wireless  communication  and network  infrastructure  technology
Although  objects generally  use wired means, such as Ethernet  or power line communication  (PLC), to access the
Internet,  wireless  communication  is more efficient  when considering  the installation  convenience  and mobility.  Short-
range wireless  communication,  such as WLAN, Bluetooth,  ZigBee, and UWB, and mobile communication,  such as 3G
and LTE, are available.  Moreover,  new technologies  for sensor  networking  are constantly  being proposed.
+ BLE (Bluetooth  Low Energy):  Also called Bluetooth  Smart, it is low-power,  short-range  wireless  communication  that
is not compatible  with existing  Bluetooth  but is compatible  with Bluetooth  4.0.
+ Z-Wave: It is a protocol  for devices  that use intelligent  mesh network  topology,  do not have a master  node, and
require low power and low bandwidth.

®loT services  and interface
It is necessary  to use ontology-based  semantic  web technology,  cloud computing  for large-scale  distributed
processing,  and open API for accessing  various  services,  to automatically  analyze  and share data collected  from the
sensor  of an object.
D) Main loT protocols
Protocols  for loT require lightweight  the most, and since they have been commonly  used for some time, protocols
that feature compatibility  and scalability  are preferable.  In particular  CoAP and MQTT are suitable  for small devices
that need to connect  to the Internet  and transmit  data, due to the nature of loT, and are proposed  as communication
protocols  in various  architectures.
@ CoAP (Constrained  Application  Protocol)
CoAP is a lightweight  application  layer protocol,  developed  by the IETF CORE Working  Group, for communication
between  objects. Although  it uses the UDP transport  layer above the IP layer, it is designed  independently  of the
lower layers and can operate  in other networks  and transport  layers. It has reduced  the message  size to reduce end-
point load and uses binary  encoding  to facilitate  encoding  and decoding.

CoAP has attracted  attention  as the main protocol  for loT, since it communicates  with endpoints  using Zigbee, rather
than fast and stable Ethernet  or Wi-Fi.
@MQTT  (Message  Queue Telemetry  Transport)
MQTT is a publish-subscribe-based  protocol  for delivering  lightweight  messages  at low speed in high-latency  and
unreliable  networks.

MQTT is a flexible data transfer  model between  multiple  endpoints  and multiple  servers and operates  by publishing
and subscribing  to necessary  topics. [Figure 149] shows a conceptual  diagram  of transmitting  the topic of the door
