## **IT Business & Ethics: Strategy, Adoption, and Outsourcing**

### **1. Information Strategy Planning (ISP) & Enterprise Architecture (EA)**

Understanding how IT initiatives are planned and integrated within an organization.

#### **1.1 Information Strategy Planning (ISP)**

*   **Purpose:** To link a company's management strategy with its information technology (IT) strategy and introduce new IT solutions. It's about planning *how* to use IT to achieve business goals.
*   **Scope:** Can be applied company-wide, to a specific service, or a department. It is more focused and "microscopic" compared to EA, concentrating on the IT informatization strategy itself.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Analyzing the business management environment (organization, stakeholders, customers).
    *   Analyzing the latest IT trends.
    *   Analyzing current business tasks and processes.
    *   Analyzing the existing information system structure.
    *   Establishing the new IT strategy and an information management system.
    *   Designing future business processes and information systems (the "To-Be" state).
    *   Creating a "To-Be" roadmap for implementation.
*   **Key Outputs:**
    *   Reports on business environment and IT trend analysis.
    *   Reports on job/information system analysis.
    *   Defined IT vision and strategy.
    *   An implementation agenda and roadmap.

#### **1.2 Enterprise Architecture (EA)**

*   **Purpose:** To create a blueprint for seamless integration of all business and information resources. It aligns IT direction with the overall management strategy.
*   **Scope:** Broader and more "macro-level" than ISP. It covers various architectures across the enterprise:
    *   **BA (Business Architecture):** How the business operates.
    *   **AA (Application Architecture):** How applications support business processes.
    *   **DA (Data Architecture):** How data is structured and managed.
    *   **TA (Technology Architecture):** The underlying technology infrastructure.
    *   **SA (Security Architecture):** How systems are secured.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Establishing direction and guidelines for IT Architecture (ITA).
    *   Establishing reference models (e.g., Business, Service, Data, Technical, Performance Reference Models).
    *   Analyzing the current ("AS-IS") architecture across all domains (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA).
    *   Establishing the target ("TO-BE") architecture for all domains.
    *   Developing an implementation plan.
    *   Establishing an ITA management system.
*   **Key Outputs:**
    *   Company-wide architecture vision, rules, and architecture matrix.
    *   Documentation of the current and target architectures (BA, AA, DA, TA, SA).
    *   A plan for implementing the target architecture.
*   **Key Characteristic:** EA must be flexible and continuously updated to respond quickly to changes in the business environment, ensuring the company's agenda is quickly implemented and shared.

#### **1.3 ISP vs. EA: Summary**

| Category    | Information Strategy Planning (ISP)                               | Enterprise Architecture (EA)                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective** | Links management & IT strategy; introduces new IT.                | Blueprint for business & IT resource integration; aligns IT with management strategy.           |
| **Scope**   | More focused on *informatization strategy*; microscopic within EA. | Broader target architecture (Business, Application, Data, Technology, Security); company-wide. |
| **Focus**   | Planning *how* IT will support goals.                            | Defining *what* the overall IT and business structure should look like.                       |

### **2. Key Considerations for IT Business Adoption**

When a company decides to implement an IT business solution, several crucial decisions arise.

*   **In-house Development vs. Outsourcing:** Deciding whether to develop solutions using internal resources or to hire external companies.
*   **Package Products vs. Custom Development:** If outsourcing, choosing between off-the-shelf software packages or building a custom system from scratch.
*   **Strategic Importance:** These decisions must enable the company to adapt to environmental changes quickly and ensure the long-term success of the IT business.
*   **Organizational Readiness:** Effective IT business adoption requires a proper organizational structure and processes for managing the building and operation of information systems.

#### **Keywords for Study:**
*   IT business adoption method
*   IT business adoption procedure
*   IT business outsourcing

### **3. Recent Trends & Issues: The Split Order Process**

*   **Problem Context (Public Sector Example):** Historically, poor planning and design of information systems (especially in the public sector) led to excessive work changes, cost overruns, and a lack of awareness/expertise regarding IT system benefits.
*   **Regulatory Measures:** Legislation now requires detailed **RFP (Request for Proposal)** and a **PMO (Project Management Office)** program for IT business deployment to improve outcomes.
*   **The "Split Order Process":** A government initiative to prevent irresponsible work changes and unfair subcontracting structures.
    *   **Core Idea:** Separates the **planning/design** phase from the **deployment/development** phase.
    *   **Planning/Design Phase:** Focuses on detailed requirement analysis, including:
        *   **ISP (Information Strategy Plan)**
        *   **ISMP (Information System Master Plan)**
        *   **Basic Design (Logical Design)**
    *   **Deployment/Development Phase:** Involves:
        *   **Detailed Design (Physical Design)**
        *   **System Development (Coding)**
        *   **Testing**
*   **Significance:**
    *   Promotes more meticulous and systematic planning and design.
    *   Helps overcome the "invisibility of software" by making requirements clearer upfront.
    *   Highlights how frequent requirement changes impede IT business success, encouraging upfront clarity.

### **4. IT Business Adoption Process**

The method by which a company acquires or develops IT systems or services.

*   **Alignment:** IT business adoption must align with the company's overall IT strategy and plans.
*   **Customization:** The methods and procedures should be tailored to the organization's size and its external environment.
*   **Core of IT:** Since the core value of IT is often implemented in software, the success of software development is critical for successful IT business adoption.
*   **Standardization:** The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, specifically following standards like **ISO/IEC 12207**, should be used for software development post-adoption.

#### **4.1 IT Business Ordering Process**

This process defines the steps for the "orderer" (the department/person needing the IT solution) and involves external "suppliers" or internal "developers."

*   **Orderer:** The department or person responsible for defining and issuing requirements.
*   **Developer/Supplier:** The company's internal IT department or an external IT outsourcing expert.
*   **Key Activities within the Ordering Process:**
    1.  **Concept Definition & Detailed Specification of Requirements:** Clearly outlining what is needed.
    2.  **Preparation of RFP (Request for Proposal):** Document inviting potential suppliers to propose solutions.
    3.  **Evaluation of Proposal & Contract Signing:** Assessing proposals and formalizing the agreement.
    4.  **Monitoring of Project:** Overseeing the project's progress.
    5.  **Handover and Completion of Project:** Receiving the final solution and closing the project.
*   **Benefits of using this process:**
    *   Clearly defines activities for both the orderer and the supplier/contractor.
    *   Enhances the success rate of the IT service business.
    *   Provides a structured means of communication between parties.
    *   Adds visibility to the IT deployment process.

---

### **5. IT Outsourcing**

Engaging external expert resources to manage or perform IT-related functions.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improves a company's competitiveness by leveraging specialized external expertise.
    *   Allows the company to focus on its core business activities.
*   **Considerations for Outsourcing:** Should primarily be considered for non-core areas or processes of the company.
*   **Risks/Challenges:**
    *   **Lock-in:** Potential dependency on the outsourced vendor, which can be:
        *   **Work-related:** Difficulty in changing vendors due to embedded processes or knowledge.
        *   **Technology-related:** Dependence on specific technologies or systems controlled by the vendor.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regulatory measures are often needed to address and manage these lock-in risks.

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
The results of the analysis  of the enterprise  environment  and the current state of the enterprise  constitute  an
important  resource  when determining  directions  for improvement,  developing  improved  job procedures,  and creating
an informatization  plan in the last stage of ISP establishment.
C) Key output  of ISP deployment
The ISP deployment  process  comprises  a set of activities  that must be performed  at each stage, and the results of
these activities  become  the output  of the deployment.
An example  of a list of typical outputs  that could be used in ISP is shown below:
<Table 10> Output  of each ISP stage (example)

system Define and prioritize  the project.
Although  the actual implementation  of ISP produces  far more diverse  and complex  outputs,  the most valuable  output
has to be a blueprint  for a process  for a future model and a set of activities  for attaining  a company’s  goals. This
content  must feature  sufficiently  in the output.
When comparing  ISP to the EA described  earlier, it can be said that ISP deals with plans that fall within the scope of
EA but which are more microscopic  than the EA. An examination  of the scope of ISP as described  in the table below
indicates  that its scope, when compared  to the EA, is more focused  on the informatization  strategy.

In other words, the EA is deployed  under a company’s  target architecture  and incorporates  the latest information
technology  so that it can align the direction  of its IT with its management  strategy.  Therefore,  the EA must be
managed  in a way that allows a company  to respond  quickly  to changes  in the business  management  environment,
and must be flexible, so that the company’s  agenda can be implanted  quickly  through  continuous  updating,  and in a
way that ensures  that the roadmap  is shared with the rest of the organization.
