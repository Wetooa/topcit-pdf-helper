### 2. Core Components Explained

#### 2.1. Servers

*   **Purpose:** Provide computing power to process business logic and data by running application programs.
*   **Key Elements:** Stacked hardware, Operating System (OS), middleware, and application programs.
*   **System Design:** Defines server capacity, count, layout, and role. Servers communicate via the network.
*   **Common Types:** Mainframes, Unix servers, and x86 servers (increasingly used with cloud expansion).
*   **Web Service Server Examples:**
    *   **Webserver:** Responds to user requests, organizes web pages, displays content.
    *   **Web Application Server (WAS):** Processes business logic based on user requests, delivers results to a database or for display.
    *   **Database Server:** Manages (creates, requests, modifies, deletes) data.

#### 2.2. Networks

*   **Purpose:** Connects all information system components for communication (e.g., server-server, server-storage, internal-external).
*   **Devices & Roles:** Vary based on the **OSI Layer 7 standard** (a model for network communication).
*   **Key Network Devices:**
    *   **Switches:** Connect devices within a local area network (LAN).
    *   **Routers:** Connect different networks (e.g., LAN to WAN - Wide Area Network).
    *   **Load Balancers (L4/L7):** Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
    *   **Bridges:** Connect two separate networks.
    *   **Access Point (AP):** Used for wireless network connectivity.
*   **Security Aspect:** Networks are common entry points for attacks. Internal networks (LAN) connected to external networks (WAN) are protected by security devices.

#### 2.3. Storage

*   **Purpose:** Stores all data for the information system.
*   **Classification by Data Storage Method:**
    *   **Block Storage:** Stores data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 16KB, 64KB). Typically used for Operating Systems (OS) like Windows, Linux, Unix.
    *   **File Storage:** Stores data in file units. **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**, often used for shared files, is an example.
    *   **Object Storage:** Stores data as objects. Mostly used in cloud storage environments.
*   **Classification by Connection Method:**
    *   **Direct Access Storage (DAS):**
        *   **Description:** Mounted directly into individual servers.
        *   **Usage:** Only accessible by the server it's attached to. Requires a filesystem.
        *   **Examples:** IDE, SATA, SAS drives.
    *   **Network Attached Storage (NAS):**
        *   **Description:** Connected to the network (like any other network device).
        *   **Usage:** Becomes usable after being mounted to the OS. Provides shared file access over a standard network.
        *   **Examples:** NFS, CIFS, AFS.
    *   **Storage Area Network (SAN):**
        *   **Description:** Connected via a network *exclusively* used for storage.
        *   **Usage:** Appears to the OS as local storage but is accessed over a dedicated high-speed network. Requires filesystem creation.
        *   **Examples:** Fibre Channel SAN, iSCSI, FCoE.

#### 2.4. Security

*   **Purpose:** Protects internal systems from external threats and controls access.
*   **Placement:** Security hardware is installed between external and internal networks, or within the internal network itself.
*   **Key Devices & Solutions:**
    *   **DDoS Defense System:** Protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
    *   **Firewalls:** Monitor, log, and block network traffic based on predefined rules.
    *   **IPS/IDS (Intrusion Prevention/Detection System):** Detect and prevent abnormal traffic or abuse.
    *   **Web Firewalls:** Specifically protect webservers by monitoring, logging, and blocking web service traffic.
    *   **Access Control Solutions:** Manage and enforce rules for who can access servers (allow/deny).

### 3. Types of System Architecture

System architecture evolves with technology (hardware, software, user environment like mobile/cloud). Modern systems often center around web services and centralized or cloud structures.

#### 3.1. Classification by System Layout

*   **A. Centralized Architecture**
    *   **Description:** All systems and data are stored and operated from a single, integrated center. Uses a large-capacity server with an integrated database.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Simple system configuration.
        *   Easy to ensure data integrity (single database).
        *   Convenient management and operation.
        *   Quick response to system failures.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Single point of failure: If the center fails, all business services stop.
        *   Load concentration during peak times.

*   **B. Multi-Region Distributed System Architecture**
    *   **Description:** Systems and applications are distributed geographically across multiple regions. Each region manages its distributed data using smaller servers.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Reduces load on individual servers by distributing user load.
        *   Regional failures only affect that specific region's services.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Difficult to manage data integrity due to distributed databases.
        *   Complex system configuration and management.

#### 3.2. Classification by Application Program Provision

*   **A. Client-Server Architecture**
    *   **Description:** System functions are divided between servers and clients. The client (e.g., a desktop application) runs some application programs and provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Provides the convenience of a GUI.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Complex configuration.
        *   Difficult development and management due to the separation into server and client parts.
    *   **Examples:** Games, chatting applications, messengers, FTP clients/servers, terminal servers.

*   **B. Web System Architecture**
    *   **Description:** The server runs application programs, and clients access services using a web browser.
    *   **Typical Components:** Webserver, Web Application Server (WAS), and Database Server.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Middleware ensures stable performance.
        *   High program reusability.
        *   Evolved from static displays to impressive GUI environments (thanks to HTML5 and PC advancements).
    *   **Prevalence:** Most recent information systems use this architecture.
    *   **Client Access:** Any PC or mobile device with a web browser can access all services.

#### 3.3. Classification by System Layer (N-Tier)

*   **Layers vs. Tiers:**
    *   **Layers:** Refer to logical structures (e.g., OSI 7 layer for networks).
    *   **Tiers:** Refer to physical structures (how components are physically deployed).
    *   The logical layer architecture can be implemented as a physical N-tier structure.

*   **Information System Logical Layers:**
    *   **Presentation Layer (GUI/Front-end):**
        *   **Function:** Highest level. Provides service information and the user interface.
        *   **Physical Examples:** Webservers, client's web browsers.
    *   **Business Logic Layer (Transaction Tier):**
        *   **Function:** Runs programs that process business requirements (business logic). Determines what data is needed from the data layer.
        *   **Physical Examples:** Application program servers (like WAS).
    *   **Data Layer:**
        *   **Function:** Accesses data resources (e.g., databases) to read or write data. Can be subdivided into data access and data store layers.
        *   **Physical Examples:** Database servers, file systems.

*   **Physical N-Tier Structures:**
    *   **A. Two-Tier Architecture**
        *   **Description:** Data storage and processing are handled by the server. Business logic and presentation are typically handled by the client.
        *   *(Note: The original text provides an incomplete sentence for this description, but this is the common understanding in this context.)*

+ Server
A server provides  the computing  power of an information  system. The information  system uses this computing
power to process  the business  logic and data by running  the application programs.  Server components  include  the
stacked  structures  of the computer's  hardware,  OS, middleware,  and application  programs.  The system  architecture
design defines  the server  capacity,  count, layout, and role, and the network  facilitates communication  between  the
servers. Mainframes,  Unix servers,  and x86 servers are the most commonly  used server types, and the x86 servers
using Intel CPUs have been used more often as the cloud services  expand.
For example,  the servers of an information  system providing  web services  include a webserver  that responds  to
user requests  through  a web browser,  organizes  web pages, and provides  a screen to display  the contents  to users,
a web application  server (WAS) that processes  business  logic, according  to the user request  and delivers  the results
to a database  server for storage,  or to a WAS for display, and a database  server that creates, requests,  modifies,
and deletes  data.
+ Network
A network  connects  the information  system components  for communication.  Network  devices  process
communication  between  servers, between  servers and storage  units, and between  the enterprise's  internal and

external  networks.  A network's  devices  and roles vary, based on the OSI layer 7 standard.  Network  devices  include
switches,  routers, load balancers  (L4/L7 load balancers),  and bridges.  Additionally,  AP (access  point) is used in
wireless  networks.  There is an overlap between  the network  domain and the security  domain. Since most of the
hacking  attacks  intrude  through  the network,  the internal network  (LAN) gate, connected  to the external  network
(WAN), is protected  by a security  device.
+ Storage
A storage system holds the data of an information  system.  It is categorized  into three types according  to how
it stores data. Block storage saves data in fixed block units, like 16KB and 64KB. It stores the OS, such as MS
Windows,  Linux, and Unix. File storage  saves data in file units, instead  of in fixed blocks. Network  attached  storage
(NAS), widely used as the shared file repository,  is a type of file storage.  Object storage  saves data in object units,
instead of in fixed blocks or files. It is mostly used in cloud storage.  Storage  types can also be categorized  by their
connection  method.  Direct access storage  (DAS) is mounted  in each server, NAS is connected  through  a network,
and storage  area network  (SAN) is connected  through  the network  used exclusively  for storage. DAS can only be
used with a filesystem  and includes  IDE, SATA, and SAS. SAN is provided  to the OS through  an SAN network,  and it
requires  the creation  of a filesystem  before it can be used as DAS. It includes  SAN, iSCSI, and FCoE. NAS becomes
usable after it is mounted  to the OS. It includes  NFS, CIFS, and AFS.

+ Security
Information  security  is configured  through  the network  connection.  Some security  hardware  is installed between
the external  Internet  section and the internal network  to protect  the internal systems,  while some are installed  in
the internal network. It includes  the DDoS defense  system to defend against  DDoS attacks,  firewalls  to protect  the
system through  monitoring,  logging,  and blocking  network  traffic, and IPS/IDS  to prevent  abnormal  traffic or abuse.
It also includes  web firewalls  protect  webservers  by logging, monitoring,  blocking  web service traffic, and access
control solutions  to provide management  functions  that allow or to deny access  to servers.
