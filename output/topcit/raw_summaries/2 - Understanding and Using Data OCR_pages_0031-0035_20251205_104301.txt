## **Database Types & XML Learning Guide**

### **01. Evolution and Major Database Types**

#### **A. Database Development Timeline**

*   **Early Days (1960s-1970s):**
    *   **Hierarchical & Network Databases:** Main types.
    *   **Problem:** Difficult to maintain data consistency.
*   **1970s:**
    *   **Relational Databases (RDB):** Appeared to solve consistency issues. Became dominant.
*   **1990s:**
    *   **Challenge:** RDBs struggled with user-defined and multimedia data.
    *   **Object-Oriented Databases (OODB):** Emerged by combining object-oriented technology with databases to handle complex data.
*   **Later Evolution:**
    *   **Object-Relational Databases (ORDB):** Combined RDB and OODB advantages. Widely used today.
    *   **Modern Era (2000s onwards):** Databases continue to evolve for large-scale, complex environments, e.g., XML databases (for Internet) and NoSQL (for Big Data).

#### **B. Major Database Types Explained**

1.  **Hierarchical Database**
    *   **Concept:** Stores data in a tree-like, subordinate-superior structure.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Oldest type (1960s).
        *   Dependent relationships maintained by physical pointers.
        *   **Pros:** Fast data access, predictable data usage.
        *   **Cons:** Difficult to change structure for evolving business processes, poor for unexpected random searches.

2.  **Network Database**
    *   **Concept:** Expands the hierarchical tree into a network, allowing many-to-many relationships using pointers.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Developed in early 1970s to improve upon hierarchical databases.
        *   Quick and effective data extraction through added links.
        *   Allows pointers to parent, child, and sibling records (unlike hierarchical).
        *   **Cons:** High maintenance costs, complex structure requires programmers to understand it.

3.  **Relational Database (RDB)**
    *   **Concept:** Based on E.F. Codd's relational data model (1970s). Stores data in a two-dimensional structure (tables with columns and rows).
    *   **Examples:** Oracle, SQL Server, DB2.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Simple Model:** Easy to understand.
        *   **Mathematical Foundation:** Based on set theory, allowing predictable performance and mathematical optimization.
        *   **Query Language:** Uses simple languages (like SQL) for easy data searching.
        *   **Modern Support:** Supports client/server architecture, large-scale parallel processing.

4.  **Object-Oriented Database (OODB)**
    *   **Concept:** Stores and retrieves information based on an object model. Emerged to handle complex, unstructured data and specific relationships that RDBs struggled with.
    *   **Examples:** ObjectStore, O2.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Supports user-defined data types and inheritance.
        *   Models unstructured complex information (e.g., multimedia).
        *   Accesses information via navigation using object references.
        *   Program's information structure matches the database schema.
        *   **Limitations:** Weak in basic database management functions (transactions, concurrent users, backup/recovery); unproven for enterprise safety and performance.

### **02. Object Relational Database (ORDB)**

#### **A. ORDB Concept**

*   **Motivation:** OODB had weaknesses in enterprise environments, despite solving RDB limitations for advanced applications.
*   **Solution:** ORDB combines the strengths of existing Relational Databases with Object-Oriented Database concepts, expanding RDB functions.
*   **Current Status:** Most commercial databases today (e.g., Oracle9i, IBM DB2 UDB, Microsoft SQL Server) are ORDBs.

#### **B. ORDB Characteristics**

*   **User-Defined Data Types:** Allows users to define and use custom data types.
*   **Reference Type Support:** Enables navigation-based data access where one object record refers to another.
*   **Nested Tables:** Supports complex data models where a column can itself be another table.
*   **Large Object (LOB) Support:** Handles large unstructured data like images, audio, and video as basic data types.
*   **Table Inheritance:** Allows specifying inheritance relationships between tables, adopting an OODB advantage.

### **03. Understanding XML (Extensible Markup Language)**

#### **A. XML Concept and Characteristics**

*   **Motivation:** HTML is good for web document formatting but not for structuring database-extracted data.
*   **Definition:** XML is a standard language developed by W3C to structure and exchange data in a web environment.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Simplified version of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
    *   **Openness:** Can be used with HTML and exchanges metadata.
    *   **Scalability:** Allows creating custom tags and is self-describing.
    *   **Readability:** Structure is understandable by both humans and machines.
    *   **Content/Expression Separation:** Allows changing format based on user preferences, increasing reusability.
    *   **Hierarchical Structure:** Supports structure and full-text searches.
    *   **Unicode Support:** Handles multiple languages.

#### **B. XML Components**

To create and process XML documents, various components are used:

*   **XML Document Type Definition (DTD):**
    *   Defines the consistent structure of an XML document.
    *   Used to validate XML documents.
*   **XML Schema:**
    *   High-level data definition language that replaces XML DTD.
    *   Allows declaring more complex data types than DTD.
*   **XPath:**
    *   Language for expressing extended queries to specify search conditions within an XML document.
    *   Provides specific addresses within XML.
*   **XQuery:**
    *   Standard XML query language.
    *   Extracts specific information from XML files, similar to querying a database.
*   **XSL/XSLT:**
    *   **XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language):** Specifies stylesheets to display XML data in various formats.
    *   **XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation):** Converts an XML document into other document types (e.g., HTML) for display in browsers.
*   **XLL (Extensible Linking Language):**
    *   Displays connections and relationships between XML elements.
    *   **XLink:** Processes hyperlinks.
    *   **XPointer:** Provides an address to specific elements within an XML document.

#### **C. XML Processor Components**

An XML Processor handles XML documents. Its key components include:

*   **XML Parser:** Checks and inspects the grammar and syntax structure of an XML document (performs validation).
*   **XML Syntax Analyzer:** Analyzes the syntax structure (e.g., using SAX, DOM models).
*   **XSL Engine:** Converts an XML document into a target document format, applying expression information (e.g., stylesheets).

01 Types of Databases
A) Development  process  of the database
The hierarchical  and network  databases  that developed  the data structure  used in existing  applications  were the
main types of database  used in the early days. However,  these databases  had a big problem  in that it was difficult  to
maintain  consistency.  To resolve these problems,  relational  databases  appeared  in the 1970s. Since then, databases
have developed  continuously  around relational  database  technology.
In the 1990s, user-defined  data and multimedia  data needed  to be managed,  but existing  relational  data models  could
not handle such complex  data. Accordingly,  an object-oriented  database  combining  object-oriented  technology,  which
began to gain attention  from the mid-1980s,  and a database  appeared.  Since then, an object-oriented  database
that combines  the advantages  of both the relational  database  and the object-oriented  database  has appeared  and
been widely used until now. Databases  are evolving  from simple business  applications  to large-capacity  and complex
business  environment  supports  to respond  to changes  in the IT market  and technology,  such as the XML database,
which emerged  as a response  to the development  of the Internet  environment,  and the NoSQL,  which was developed
to process  big data.

B) Major  types of databases
@ Hierarchical  database
A hierarchical  database  hierarchically  stores data in a tree format of the relationship  between  subordinates  and
superiors. Although  this database  has the advantages  of rapid data access and easy prediction  of data usage, it
cannot  adapt to changing  business  processes  easily.
The major characteristics  of the hierarchical  database  are as follows.
+ Itis the oldest  database  with a hierarchical  structure  (1960s).
+ Each hierarchical  structure  maintains  a dependent  relationship  by connecting  with physical  pointers.
+ Itis difficult  to change  the data structure  when the business  process  is changed  after building  a database.

Database )
* It is difficult  to perform  unexpected  random  search.
@ Network  database
A network  database  stores data by expanding  the tree form of a hierarchical  database  into a network  form. Pointers
are used to maintain  a many-to-many  relationship  between  records  and to link data.
The major characteristics  of the network  database  are as follows.
+ It was developed  in the early 1970s to solve the problems  with the hierarchical  database.
+ Data can be extracted  quickly  and effectively  by adding  links between  hierarchical  structures.
+ High maintenance  costs and backlog  are entailed  by the complex  type system.
+ Programmers  must understand  the structure  to write a program.
+ A record can have pointers  to children and sibling records and to parent  records, which was not possible  with the
hierarchical  database.
@ Relational  database  (RDB)
The relational  database  is based on the relational  data model proposed  by E.F. Codd in the 1970s. Major commercial
products  include  Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Informix,  Sybase,  and Ingres.
Characteristics  of the relational  database
+ The model itself is simple.  The database  stores characters/numbers/date  information  in a two-dimensional  structure
(column,  row).
* The model is based on mathematical  theory - particularly  the set theory of mathematics.  Therefore,  the
performance  of the system to be developed  can be predicted  and verified mathematically,  and various operations
can be mathematically  optimized.
+ Existence  of query language  - Anyone  can easily search for desired information  by leaming  a simple query language
in the 4GL format.
+ Contiguous  support  for technology  that keeps pace with the circumstances  of the times - Supports  the client/
server architecture,  large-scale  parallel processing,  etc.
@ Object-oriented  database  (OODB)
The relational  database  cannot create new types of data or expand existing  types, and has difficulty  processing
unstructured  complex  information  such as multimedia. Also, the standard  query language  “SQL” expresses  data
relationships  by values, making  it difficult  to find and process mutually related entities when expressing  a complex
object. Accordingly,  a database  that can search and store information  based on an object model emerged,  namely,
the object-oriented  database.  Major commercial  products  include ObjectStore,  O2, Objectivity,  and Uni-SQL.
The object-oriented  database  has the following  characteristics,
+ User-defined  data types are supported,  and inheritance  can be specified.
+ Unstructured  complex  information  can be modeled.
+ Information  can b...
