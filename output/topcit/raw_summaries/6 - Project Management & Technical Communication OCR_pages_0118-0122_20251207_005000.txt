## Project Quality Management Learning Guide

Project Quality Management ensures that project results meet specified quality standards. It involves three main stages: Quality Planning, Quality Assurance, and Quality Control.

### 1. The Quality Management Process

The overall quality management process is divided into three key stages:

*   **Quality Planning:** Establishes the overall process and plan for quality management.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Manages quality throughout the project's business or manufacturing process.
*   **Quality Control:** Checks the quality *before* the final product or service is delivered to the customer.

### 2. Quality Planning

**A) Concept of Quality Planning**
*   **Definition:** Documenting a plan that identifies activities and methods the project team will use to achieve specific quality targets.
*   **Timing:** Should be prepared *early* in the project, not just inspected afterwards.

**B) Cost of Quality (CoQ)**
*   **Concept:** Calculates all costs incurred by the project team to achieve a predetermined quality target.
*   **Purpose:** To reduce **Failure Costs** by increasing **Prevention Costs** and **Appraisal Costs**.

*   **Types of Cost of Quality:**
    *   **Cost of Conformance (Doing it Right):** Costs to achieve quality.
        *   **Prevention Costs:** Costs to prevent defects.
            *   *Examples:* Education, training, documentation, equipment improvement, schedule improvements.
        *   **Appraisal Costs:** Costs to check/verify product quality.
            *   *Examples:* Tests, inspections, destructive testing costs, verification.
    *   **Cost of Nonconformance (Doing it Wrong):** Costs due to failing quality.
        *   **Internal Failure Costs:** Costs of correcting defects *before* product delivery.
            *   *Examples:* Rework, wasted materials.
        *   **External Failure Costs:** Costs of correcting defects found *after* delivery to customers.
            *   *Examples:* Liability, defect repair, business loss.

**C) Quality Plan Document**
*   **Purpose:** A project management plan prepared at the beginning of the project to ensure the quality of the system while meeting schedule and cost constraints.
*   **Sample Components:**
    *   Overview Objective

### 3. Quality Assurance

**A) Concept of Quality Assurance**
*   **Definition:** Techniques and activities that monitor quality requirements and the results of quality control to ensure that quality standards are being applied.

**B) Comparison of Quality Control and Quality Assurance**

| Feature      | Quality Control                               | Quality Assurance                               |

**D) Project Quality Assurance Activities (Examples)**
*   **Configuration Management:** Managing configuration items (e.g., program sources, deliverables) including identification, control, and audits. Establishing baselines.
*   **Document Management:** Establishing procedures for document creation, storage, and distinguishing official client deliverables from internal work products.
*   **Quality Record:** Documenting the establishment, execution, and results of the quality assurance plan (e.g., test results for unit, integrated, and system tests).
*   **Joint Review:** Reviewing project progress at milestones, typically through weekly/monthly reports.
*   **Verification and Validation:** Activities performed regularly at the end of each project stage (analysis, design, development, testing) and non-regularly for major events.
*   **Corrective Action:** Implementing solutions and actions based on feedback from quality assurance results, addressing errors or improvements.
*   **Risk Management:** Conducting activities to resolve realistic risks or restrictions that may hinder project activities.
*   **Issue Management:** Analyzing and responding to issues such as changes in customer requirements or alternative development needs.

### 4. Quality Control

**A) Concept of Quality Control**
*   **Definition:** Activities and procedures that record and monitor the results of quality activities to achieve quality targets.
*   **Process:** Measures performance, schedule, and cost variances; analyzes quality nonconformity factors; and suggests corrective actions to verify that project results meet quality standards.

**B) Quality Control Tools and Techniques**
*   Quality control often uses statistical information extraction. The following are known as the **7 Basic Quality Tools (7QC tools)**, used to solve quality-related problems within the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycle:
    1.  **Pareto Chart**
    2.  **Cause and Effect Diagram** (also known as Fishbone Diagram or Ishikawa Diagram)
    3.  **Control Chart**
    4.  **Scatter Diagram**
    5.  **Flowchart**
    6.  **Check Sheet**
    7.  **Histogram**

[Figure  40] Quality  Management  Process
The quality management  process  can be largely divided into three stages: quality planning,  quality assurance,
and quality  control. In other words, the quality planning  stage establishes  an overall process  and plan for quality
management.  Quality  assurance  is the process  of managing  quality in the process  throughout  the business  or
manufacturing  process.  Quality  control is the stage of checking  the quality before the final product  or service
is delivered  to the customer.  Let's look at more details one by one below.
A) Quality  plan
@ Quality  Planning
Quality planning  is the task of documenting  a plan that identifies  the activities  the project  team must perform
to achieve a given quality target, and determines  how to perform it. The quality of the project should be
planned  in advance  rather than inspected  afterwards, so a quality plan should be prepared  early in the project.
@ Cost of Quality
Cost of Quality is a concept  of calculating  the cost of all activities  of the project team to achieve a
predetermined  quality target. The purpose  of quality cost management  is to reduce Failure cost of a project,
and accordingly,  the cost (Prevention  cost) for activities  to prevent  defects and the cost (Appraisal  cost) for
activities  to check/verify  the quality  of the product  relatively  get higher.

Quality Plan is one of the project management  plans prepared  at the beginning  of the project to ensure the
quality of the result (system)  built by the project  team while complying  with the schedule  (project  duration)  at
a set cost.
