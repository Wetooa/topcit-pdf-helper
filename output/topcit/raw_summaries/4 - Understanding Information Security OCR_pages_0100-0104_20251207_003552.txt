### **Section 1: Windows System Security**

#### **1.1 Overview of Windows System Security**

Windows systems require security management across several areas to protect against threats.

**Key Security Areas & Checks:**

*   **Account & Password Management:**
    *   Remove unnecessary accounts, especially those with administrator privileges.
    *   Implement strong password policies (vulnerable passwords, encryption, auto-locks on errors, max usage period).
*   **Access Control:**
    *   Configure shared folder permissions.
    *   Control remote registry access.
    *   Set automatic screen locks.
*   **System Security:**
    *   Manage system directory and Windows account privileges.
    *   Monitor system utilization rates.
*   **Service Security:**
    *   Disable unnecessary services (e.g., terminal services, anonymous FTP, SNMP).
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Configure system audit policies and log recording.
*   **Other Security Management:**
    *   Apply general security settings.
    *   Review scheduling details.
    *   Ensure antivirus use and latest patch status.

#### **1.2 Account and Password Management**

##### **A. Deleting Guest & Unnecessary Accounts**

*   **Purpose:** Restrict access by unspecified individuals and remove potential attack vectors.
*   **Action:** Delete guest accounts and any other unused accounts.
    *   If unspecified access is needed, create *general user accounts* with specific permissions, not guest accounts.
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `lusrmgr.msc`.
    2.  Open "Local Users and Groups".
    3.  Locate and delete guest accounts and other unnecessary accounts.

##### **B. Setting Account Lockout Policy**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent brute-force and password cracking attacks by locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
*   **Recommended Settings:**
    *   **Account lockout duration:** 60 minutes
    *   **Account lockout threshold:** 5 invalid logon attempts
    *   **Reset account lockout counter after:** 60 minutes
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `secpol.msc`.
    2.  Navigate to `Security Settings` -> `Account Policies` -> `Account Lockout Policy`.
    3.  Configure the three settings mentioned above.

#### **1.3 Access Control**

##### **A. Checking Unnecessary Shared Folders & Stopping Sharing**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent malware/virus spread and unauthorized access through open shares.
*   **Action:** Identify and remove any shared folders that are not essential or are not properly secured. If a shared folder is necessary, ensure only authorized users have access.
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `fsmgmt.msc`.
    2.  Review the list of shared folders.
    3.  Stop sharing for any unnecessary folders.

#### **1.4 System Security**

##### **A. Turning Off Automatic Administrator Logon**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent attackers from easily discovering login credentials stored in the Windows registry.
*   **Action:** Disable the automatic logon function.
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `regedit`.
    2.  Navigate to `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.
    3.  Set the `AutoAdminLogon` value to "0".
    4.  If a `DefaultPassword` entry exists, delete it.

##### **B. Checking Startup Programs**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent malware from automatically executing when the computer starts.
*   **Action:** Review and delete any unauthorized or unnecessary programs from the startup list.
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `msconfig`.
    2.  In the "System Configuration" dialog, click the `Startup` tab.
    3.  Uncheck (`✓`) any unauthorized or unnecessary programs.
    4.  Click `OK` and `Restart` the computer if prompted.

#### **1.5 Service Security**

##### **A. Stopping Unnecessary Startup Services**

*   **Purpose:** Eliminate potential security vulnerabilities and conserve system resources. Many default services are not always needed.
*   **Action:** Stop and disable services that are not required for the system's specific purpose.
*   **How-to:**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `services.msc`.
    2.  Identify unnecessary services from the list.
    3.  Right-click the service, select `Properties`, then click `Stop`.
    4.  Change the "Startup type" to "Disabled".

##### **B. Checking Terminal Service (Remote Desktop Services)**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent Remote Desktop Services (RDS) from being exploited due to weak passwords or inadequate access control.
*   **Action:**
    *   Verify if RDS is truly necessary.
    *   If used, set the encryption level to "Medium" or higher.

### **Section 2: Unix-like System Security**

#### **2.1 Overview of Unix-like System Security**

Unix and Linux-like systems (commonly used as servers) also require robust security management.

**Key Security Areas & Checks:**

*   **Account & Password Management:**
    *   Remove unnecessary accounts, especially those with root privileges.
    *   Implement strong password policies (vulnerable passwords, encryption, auto-locks, max usage period).
*   **Access Control:**
    *   Restrict access to approved PCs/users.
    *   Ensure remote access encryption.
    *   Set session end times.
*   **System Security:**
    *   Configure user environment settings.
    *   Secure key directories and files.
    *   Protect boot scripts.
*   **Service Security:**
    *   Disable unnecessary services (e.g., NFS, anonymous FTP, SNMP).
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Configure log recording settings.
    *   Check CPU/file system use rates.
*   **Other Security Management:**
    *   Set access warning messages.
    *   Review scheduling content.
    *   Perform latest patch checks.

#### **2.2 Account and Password Management**

##### **A. Deleting Unnecessary Accounts**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent exploitation through default or suspicious accounts, which often have vulnerable default passwords.
*   **Action:** Delete accounts created by default during OS/package installation if not needed, and any suspicious accounts.
    *   System accounts that don't require login should be prohibited from logging in.
*   **How-to (Command Line):**
    *   **SUN/HP-UX:** `userdel [account_name]` (e.g., `userdel lp`)
    *   **AIX:** `rmuser [account_name]` (e.g., `rmuser lp`)

##### **B. Checking for Vulnerable Passwords**

*   **Purpose:** Identify and strengthen weak, easily guessable passwords to prevent unauthorized system access.
*   **Recommendation:** Passwords should be 8+ characters, a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and not similar to the account name.
*   **How-to (Using Password Cracking Tools):**
    1.  Use a password cracking tool like `john the ripper`.
    2.  Copy the encrypted password hash (from `/etc/shadow` or `/etc/passwd` for HP-UX) into a file (e.g., `password.txt`).
    3.  Run the tool: `john password.txt`

#### **2.3 Access Control**

##### **A. Allowing Access to Authorized Systems Only (Inetd/Xinetd)**

*   **Purpose:** Prevent unauthorized users from registering and executing malicious programs with root privileges via the Internet service daemon (`inetd`).
*   **Mechanism:** The `inetd` daemon executes internal Internet service programs registered in `/etc/inetd.conf` (or `xinetd.d` files) when requested by external networks. Incorrect settings can be exploited.
*   **Action:** Explicitly define who is allowed and denied access.
*   **How-to:**
    *   Use `/etc/hosts.allow` to specify systems that *are allowed* access.
    *   Use `/etc/hosts.deny` to specify systems that *are denied* access.

##### **B. Setting Session Idle Timeout**

*   **Purpose:** Mitigate confidentiality and availability risks by automatically blocking inactive user sessions on a server.
*   **Action:** Configure sessions to terminate or block after a specified period of inactivity.
*   **How-to:**
    *   **General:** Add `TIMEOUT=300` (stops sessions after 300 seconds of inactivity) to the `/etc/default/login` file.
    *   **HP-UX, AIX, Linux:** Add `TMOUT=300; export TMOUT` to the `/etc/profile` or `.profile` file.

#### **2.4 System Security**

##### **A. Setting Privileges to the User's Default Configuration File**

*(Note: The original text provided ends abruptly here, so the details for this section are incomplete.)*
*   **Concept:** Ensure that user-specific configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.profile`) have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized modification or execution of malicious code.
