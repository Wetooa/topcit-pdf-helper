## Project Cost Management: A Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to Cost Management

**What is Cost Management?**
Cost management is the process of planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs to complete a project within its approved budget. It's crucial because projects operate with limited resources.

**Why is Cost Management Important?**
*   Projects require formal approval and allocated budgets.
*   Exceeding the budget due to poor cost management (e.g., scope expansion, schedule delays) requires reporting to stakeholders.
*   Effective cost management means:
    *   Accurate cost estimation at the start.
    *   Good scope and schedule management throughout the project.

**Cost vs. Price:**
*   **Cost:** The monetary value of resources invested in producing a product or service. Determined by the supplier's production capacity.
*   **Price:** The amount a client pays for a product or service. Determined by business judgment between client and supplier.
*   *Note:* "Cost" is often used for profit/loss measurement of individual products/services, while "expense" is period-based.

### 2. The Cost Management Process

Project cost management involves a set of activities to ensure the project stays within budget. The main process steps are:

1.  **Cost Management Planning**
2.  **Cost Estimation**
3.  **Budgeting**
4.  **Cost Control**

#### A. Cost Management Planning

This is the initial step to define *how* project costs will be managed throughout its lifecycle. It involves:
*   Establishing methods for cost management.
*   Determining various cost estimation techniques to use.
*   Identifying responsibilities for cost management roles.
*   Setting up how costs will be predicted based on project information.

#### B. Cost Estimation

This process develops an estimate of the monetary resources needed to complete the project.

**Key Estimation Techniques:**

*   **Analogous Estimating:**
    *   Estimates current project cost based on similar past projects (scope, cost, budget, duration).
*   **Bottom-up Estimating:**
    *   Estimates the cost of individual, lowest-level work packages and then sums them up to get an overall project cost.
    *   **Pros:** High accuracy, detailed.
    *   **Cons:** Time-consuming, affected by individual activity complexity.
*   **Expert Judgment:**
    *   Uses expertise from individuals or groups to provide cost estimates, considering factors like labor, materials, inflation, and risks from similar past projects.
*   **Three-point Estimating:**
    *   Uses three values to estimate cost, accounting for uncertainty and risk:
        *   **Most Likely:** Realistic estimate.
        *   **Optimistic:** Best-case scenario.
        *   **Pessimistic:** Worst-case scenario.
    *   *(Often calculated as (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6 for a weighted average, though not explicitly stated in the text).*

**Software-Specific Cost Estimation Techniques:**

*   **Function Point (FP):**
    *   An international standard (ISO/IEC 14143) for estimating software development cost.
    *   Measures software scale quantitatively from the user's perspective (functions requested/delivered).
    *   Multiplies the calculated Function Points by a unit price per FP to get the cost.
    *   **Advantage:** Can estimate project size *before* development starts by identifying user functions, unlike methods based on Lines of Code (LOC) or Man/Month (M/M).
    *   **Function Categories:**
        *   **Data Functions:** Internal Logical Files, External Interface Files.
        *   **Transaction Functions:** External Inputs, External Outputs, External Inquiries.
*   **Man/Month (M/M):** (Mentioned in keywords and FP comparison, implies it's another method, though not detailed here).
*   **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model):** (Mentioned in keywords and FP comparison, implies it's another method, though not detailed here, often LOC-based).

#### C. Budgeting

This process aggregates all estimated costs (from individual activities and work packages) to create an **approved cost baseline**.
*   **Cost Baseline:** The approved version of the project budget, *excluding* management reserves.
*   **Project Budget:** The sum of the Cost Baseline and Management Reserves.
*   **Contingency Reserves:** Funds included in the *cost baseline* to cover unexpected costs for *planned activities* (managed by the project manager).
*   **Management Reserves:** Funds held for *unforeseen changes to scope or work not yet defined* (controlled by senior management like CTO, sponsor, or CEO).

#### D. Cost Control

This process monitors the status of project costs and manages changes to the cost baseline.
*   **Goal:** To identify variances (differences between planned and actual costs) and take corrective action.

**Earned Value Management (EVM):**
*   A widely used method for cost control.
*   It integrates scope, schedule, and cost performance.
*   Compares the value of work *earned* (completed) against the value of work *planned* and the *actual cost* incurred.

**Key EVM Terms (from keywords):**
*   **BAC (Budget At Completion):** The total budget planned for the project.
*   **Planned Value (PV):** The budgeted cost of work scheduled to be completed by a given date.
*   **Earned Value (EV):** The budgeted cost of work actually performed by a given date.
*   **Actual Cost (AC):** The total cost actually incurred for the work performed by a given date.

**EVM Analysis Metrics (from keywords):**
*   **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV (measures schedule performance).
*   **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC (measures cost performance).
*   **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV (efficiency of schedule progress).
*   **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC (efficiency of budget utilization).

**EVM Estimation Metrics (from keywords):**
*   **EAC (Estimate At Completion):** The projected total cost of the project when completed.
*   **ETC (Estimate To Complete):** The estimated cost needed to finish the remaining work.

**Example of Cost Control (Simplified):**
If an activity was planned for 5 days at KRW 300,000/day, totaling KRW 1,500,000.
*   **Planned (PV):** KRW 1,500,000 for the full activity.
*   **Actual Progress:** After 5 days, only 90% of the work is complete.
*   **Earned Value (EV):** 90% of KRW 1,500,000 = KRW 1,350,000.
*   **Analysis:** If the actual cost (AC) for this 90% completion was, say, KRW 1,500,000 (meaning you spent the full budget but only got 90% done), then:
    *   **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC = KRW 1,350,000 - KRW 1,500,000 = -KRW 150,000 (cost overrun).
    *   This shows that KRW 150,000 was spent excessively for the work completed, or less work was achieved for the money spent.

01 Concept  of Cost Management
A) Concept  of cost
Price is the amount  of money the client pays in exchange  for the supplier's  provision  of a product  or service
in a business  relationship  and is determined  by business  judgment  between  the client and the supplier.  On the
other hand, cost is the monetary  value of resources  invested  in the production  of a product  or service and is
determined  by the production  capacity  of the supplier.
For reference,  cost is often translated as expense.  In other words, they can be distinguished  by how the loss
and profit from the project execution  are measured.  Cost is mainly used when the profit and loss measure-
ment is based on an individual  product  or service, ...
