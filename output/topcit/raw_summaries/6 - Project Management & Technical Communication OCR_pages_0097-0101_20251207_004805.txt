## Learning Guide: Schedule Management Techniques

### 1. Introduction to Schedule Management

Effective schedule management ensures projects are completed on time. Key activities include:
*   **Reprioritizing tasks** in the project backlog as needed.
*   **Determining the rate** at which deliverables are produced and accepted per work cycle (e.g., two weeks, one month).
*   **Monitoring project schedule changes.**
*   **Managing actual changes** that occur.

### 2. Schedule Development Technique: Critical Path Method (CPM)

CPM is a network analysis technique used to determine the **minimum duration** required to complete a project. It identifies the "critical path" – the longest sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to finish by its earliest date.

#### Key Concepts in CPM:

*   **Critical Path:** The sequence of activities that, if delayed, will delay the entire project. It's identified by activities with **Zero Total Float**.
*   **Forward Pass:** Calculates the earliest possible start and finish dates for activities.
    *   **Early Start (ES):** The earliest date an activity can begin.
    *   **Early Finish (EF):** The earliest date an activity can finish.
*   **Backward Pass:** Calculates the latest possible start and finish dates for activities without delaying the project.
    *   **Late Start (LS):** The latest date an activity can start without delaying the project's finish date.
    *   **Late Finish (LF):** The latest date an activity can finish without delaying the project's finish date.
*   **Total Float (TF):** The amount of time an activity can be delayed or extended without delaying the project's overall finish date.
    *   **Formula:** `TF = LF - EF` or `TF = LS - ES`

#### Steps to Perform CPM:

**Input:** A Project Schedule Network Diagram showing activity sequence, duration, dependencies, leads, and lags.

**Example Activities:**

| Activity Name | Duration | Predecessor Activity |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------- |
| A             | 3 days   | -                    |
| B             | 2 days   | A                    |
| C             | 2 days   | B, D                 |
| D             | 4 days   | A                    |
| E             | 6 days   | D                    |
| F             | 3 days   | E                    |

**1. Activity Definition & Duration Estimation:**
*   List all project activities.
*   Estimate duration for each.
*   Identify predecessor activities (what must finish before this can start).
*   Draw a network diagram linking activities based on their sequential relationships.

    *(Example diagram for Activities A-F)*
    ```
    (A) --- (B) --- (C)
     |       /
     |      /
     (D) --- (E) --- (F)
    ```

**2. Forward Scheduling (Calculate ES & EF):**
*   **Purpose:** Determine the earliest possible start and finish for each activity.
*   **Formulas:**
    *   `ES = (EF of immediate predecessor activity) + 1`
    *   `EF = ES of activity + activity duration - 1`
*   **Rule for Multiple Predecessors:** If an activity has multiple predecessors, its ES is calculated using the **latest** EF of all its immediate predecessors.
*   **Starting Point:** For the first activity(ies) with no predecessors, ES starts at 1.

| Activity Name | ES             | Duration | EF             |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| A             | 1              | 3        | 3 (1+3-1)      |
| B             | 4 (EF of A + 1)| 2        | 5 (4+2-1)      |
| C             | 8 (EF of D + 1)*| 2        | 9 (8+2-1)      |
| D             | 4 (EF of A + 1)| 4        | 7 (4+4-1)      |
| E             | 8 (EF of D + 1)| 6        | 13 (8+6-1)     |
| F             | 14 (EF of E + 1)| 3        | 16 (14+3-1)    |

    *For Activity C, predecessors are B (EF=5) and D (EF=7). Take the max EF (7) + 1 = 8.*

**3. Backward Scheduling (Calculate LS & LF):**
*   **Purpose:** Determine the latest possible start and finish for each activity without delaying the project.
*   **Formulas:**
    *   `LS = (LF of activity) - (activity duration) + 1`
    *   `LF = (LS of successor activity) - 1`
*   **Rule for Multiple Successors:** If an activity has multiple successors, its LF is calculated using the **earliest** LS of all its immediate successors.
*   **Starting Point:** For the last activity(ies) with no successors, LF is equal to its EF (the overall project finish date).

| Activity Name | LS             | Duration | LF             |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| F             | 14 (16-3+1)    | 3        | 16 (Project End)|
| E             | 8 (13-6+1)     | 6        | 13 (LS of F - 1)|
| D             | 4 (7-4+1)      | 4        | 7 (LS of E - 1)*|
| C             | 12 (13-2+1)    | 2        | 13 (LS of F - 1)|
| B             | 10 (11-2+1)    | 2        | 11 (LS of C - 1)|
| A             | 1 (4-3+1)      | 3        | 3 (LS of D - 1)|

    *For Activity D, successors are C (LS=12) and E (LS=8). Take the min LS (8) - 1 = 7.*

**4. Calculate Total Float & Identify Critical Path:**
*   **Calculate Total Float (TF)** for each activity using `TF = LF - EF` or `TF = LS - ES`.
*   **Identify Critical Path:** The critical path consists of activities where TF = 0.

| Activity Name | ES | EF | LS | LF | TF (LF-EF) |
| :------------ | :- | :- | :- | :- | :--------- |
| A             | 1  | 3  | 1  | 3  | 0          |
| B             | 4  | 5  | 10 | 11 | 6          |
| C             | 8  | 9  | 12 | 13 | 4          |
| D             | 4  | 7  | 4  | 7  | 0          |
| E             | 8  | 13 | 8  | 13 | 0          |
| F             | 14 | 16 | 14 | 16 | 0          |

*   **Result:** Activities A, D, E, F have a Total Float of 0.
*   **Critical Path:** **A - D - E - F**
*   **Importance:** Any delay to activities on the critical path will delay the entire project. These activities require intense schedule management.

### 3. Schedule Development Technique: Critical Chain Method (CCM)

CCM is a scheduling method that builds upon CPM by specifically accounting for **limited resources** and **uncertainty** in activity durations.

*   **Enhancement over CPM:** CCM adds **buffers** to the schedule to mitigate the effects of resource allocation, optimization, leveling, and duration uncertainty.
*   **Focus:** Instead of managing total float of network paths, CCM focuses on managing the remaining durations of these buffers against the remaining durations of activity chains.

#### Types of Buffers in CCM:

1.  **Project Buffer:**
    *   Placed at the **very end** of the critical chain.
    *   Purpose: To prevent the target project finish date from slipping due to delays on the critical chain.
2.  **Feeding Buffer:**
    *   Placed at each point where a **non-critical activity path (feeding chain)** merges into the critical chain.
    *   Purpose: To protect the critical chain from delays occurring in these feeding paths.
    *   Size is determined by considering the duration uncertainty of the feeding chain.

O02 Schedule  Management  Technique
A) Schedule  development  technique  - critical path method  (CPM)
The critical path method  is a network  analysis  technique  used to determine  the minimum  duration  of a project.
It is a technique  of finding  the path that determines  the minimum  duration  of the project among  many, that is,
the critical path. The critical path technique  is known as Critical Path Method.
The critical path is the minimum  path connecting  activities  with “Zero” float. Using a Project  Schedule  Network
Diagram as an input, you take into account  the sequence  of activities,  duration,  dependency,  lead, and delay
and conduct  Forward  Pass and Backward  Pass analysis  to calculate  Early Start(ES),  Early Finish(EF),  Late
Start(LS)  and Late Finish(LF).

In order to calculate  the schedule  by hand using the critical path method,  the activity  is expressed  as follows.
Activity  Name
The following  is an example  of calculating  a schedule  using the critical path method.  The critical path method
will be described  in detail through  the example  below.
<Table 43> Critical Path Method  (Example)
Activity  Name Duration Predecessor  Activity
A 3 days
B 2 days A
Cc 2 days B,D
D 4 days A
E 6 days D
F 3 days GE
@ Activity  Definition,  Duration  Estimation
If the activities  of the project are defined and the duration  of each activity is estimated,  the activities  are
linked according  to the sequential  relationship  as follows. Arrange  the identified  activities  according  to the
sequential  relationship  and enter the activity  name and duration.
6 /{> E
[Figure 30] Critical Path Method@  (Example)
In the case of the activity  name “B’, it is placed after the activity  “A” because  the Predecessor  Activity  is “A”, and the
duration  of the activity  “B’ is 2 days, so enter 2 in the “Duration”.  Likewise,  for all other activities,  predecessor  activities
are identified  and arranged  in order, and the duration  of the activity  is written  at the top of the activity  name.

@ Forward  Scheduling
The Early Start (ES) and Early Finish (EF) of each activity  are calculated,  and the formula  is as follows:
+ ES = EF of immediate  predecessor  activity  + 1
+ EF = ES of activity + activity  duration  - 1
<Table 44> Result of Forward  Scheduling  by Activity
Activity  Name ES (Early Start) Duration EF (Early Finish)
A 1 3 3(1 + 3-1)
B 4(3 + 1) 2 5(4 + 2-1)
c apa 2 9(8 + 2-1)
D 4(3 + 1) 4 7(4 + 4-1)
E 8(7 + 1) 6 13(8 + 6-1)
F 14(13 + 1) 3 16(14 + 3-1)
For Activity  “A’, there is no EF of predecessor  activity,  so ES starts with 1.
In the case of Activity  “C’, there are two predecessor  activities:  “B’ and “D’. In this case, as Activity  “C” can be
started after both “B” and “D” activities  are finished,  the EF of the immediate  predecessor  activity  used in the
ES calculation  is 7, which is the EF of Activity  “D’, which is then added with one to become  eight (7 + 1 = 8).
After calculating  all ES and EF for each activity,  fill in as shown in the figure below.
