## Software Quality Assurance & Control: A Study Guide

This guide covers key concepts in software quality assurance techniques, project activities, quality control, and relevant quality standards.

---

### **1. Types of Quality Assurance (QA) Techniques**

QA techniques ensure software quality and can be classified by *timing* and *purpose*.

#### **A. Classification by Timing**

*   **Prevention:** Inspection performed *before* errors occur in intermediate deliverables. Aims to stop problems early.
*   **Inspection:** Inspection performed *before* delivery to the customer. Aims to find errors in final deliverables.

#### **B. Classification by Purpose (Specific Techniques)**

| Technique           | Purpose                                                                 | Participants         | Leadership    | Data Volume      | Deliverable                      |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Technical Review** | Assess conformity to specifications/plans; ensure integrity of changes. | Developer participant | Senior engineer | Big (depends on purpose) | Technology Review                |
| **Software Inspection** | Find defects and verify solutions.                                      | Developer participant | Moderator     | Relatively small | Inspection Report & Defects List |
| **Walkthrough**     | Find defects; verify alternatives.                                      | Developer participant | Developer     | Relatively small | Review Report                    |

### **2. Project Quality Assurance Activities**

These are common activities performed in a project for software quality assurance.

*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Identifies, controls, and audits configuration items (e.g., program sources, deliverables).
    *   Starts by setting a baseline for management.
*   **Document Management:**
    *   Establishes procedures for document creation, storage, and management.
    *   Distinguishes client deliverables from internal project work products.
*   **Quality Assurance Plan:**
    *   Establishes, executes, and records the results of the QA plan.
*   **Quality Record:**
    *   Provides test results (unit, integrated, system tests) to customers.
*   **Joint Review:**
    *   Review project progress against milestones.
    *   Conducted via weekly/monthly reports and occasional reports.
*   **Verification and Validation (V&V):**
    *   Activities performed at the end of each project stage (analysis, design, development, testing).
    *   Done regularly and non-regularly (for major events).
*   **Corrective Action:**
    *   Solutions and actions taken as feedback on QA results.
    *   Supplements activities for errors and improvements.
*   **Risk Management:**
    *   Activities to resolve realistic risks impacting project activities.
*   **Issue Management:**
    *   Analyzes issues like changes in customer requirements, alternative development, and responses.

### **3. Quality Control (QC)**

#### **A. Concept of Quality Control**

*   **Definition:** Activities and procedures that record and monitor quality activity results to achieve quality targets.
*   **Purpose:** Verify project results meet quality standards, measure variances (performance, schedule, cost), analyze nonconformity, and suggest corrective actions.

#### **B. Quality Control Tools and Techniques (The 7 Basic Quality Tools)**

These tools use statistical information to identify and solve quality problems, often within the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycle.

1.  **Pareto Chart:**
    *   **Purpose:** Prioritize problems by sorting defects/causes by frequency of occurrence.
    *   **Principle:** Relatively few causes (the "vital few") generally lead to most problems (the 80/20 rule).
    *   **Visual:** Histogram showing frequency, with a cumulative percentage line.
2.  **Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone Diagram / Ishikawa Diagram):**
    *   **Purpose:** Represent how causes and effects relate. Identifies possible causes for a specific effect (problem).
    *   **Use:** Commonly used for preventing defects in product design and quality.
    *   **Structure:** Looks like a fishbone, with the "effect" at the head and main "causes" branching off.
3.  **Control Chart:**
    *   **Purpose:** Determine if a process maintains a certain level of quality (is "in control").
    *   **Indicator:** A process is judged unstable if the number of defects exceeds control limits (upper/lower control limits, target value).
4.  **Scatter Diagram:**
    *   **Purpose:** Identify the impact and relationship between two variables.
    *   **Use:** Visually expresses the cause (factor) and effect (characteristic) relationship between variables.
5.  **Other Basic Tools:** Flowchart, Check Sheet, Histogram (mentioned but not detailed in text).

### **4. Quality Evaluation Perspective & Standards**

#### **A. Quality Evaluation Perspective**

*   **Product Quality:**
    *   **Focus:** Evaluates the functionality and reliability of the final product.
    *   **Standards:** ISO/IEC 9126 (now 25000-2) and 6 Sigma are common.
*   **Process Quality:**
    *   **Focus:** Evaluates whether the development process is well-defined and properly operated (belief: good products come from good processes).
    *   **Standards:** ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 12207, and CMMI are widely used.

#### **B. Quality Standards**

1.  **ISO/IEC 9126 (Currently ISO/IEC 25000-2): Software Product Quality**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines software quality characteristics and metrics from a *user's point of view*.
    *   **Structure:**
        *   **ISO 9126-1:** Core model with 6 quality characteristics and 21 sub-characteristics. Helps stakeholders define and evaluate software product quality.
        *   **ISO 9126-2 (External metrics):** Measures properties appearing during software use (final product from user/manager view).
        *   **ISO 9126-3 (Internal metrics):** Measures internal software properties of interim products at each development stage.
        *   **ISO 9126-4 (Quality in use metrics):** Measures if goals for efficiency, productivity, safety, and satisfaction are met when using the finished software.

2.  **ISO 12207: Software Life Cycle Processes**
    *   **Purpose:** A standard for *software processes* providing guidelines across the Software Life Cycle (SDLC) for systematic acquisition, supply, development, operation, and maintenance.
    *   **Focus:** Defines a high-level framework for communication among software practitioners.
    *   **Key Life Cycle Processes:**
        *   **Acquisition:** Activities for organizations acquiring systems/software.
        *   **Supply:** Activities for organizations supplying systems/software.
        *   **Development:** Activities for organizations defining and building software products.
        *   **Operation:** Activities for organizations providing information system operation services in an actual environment.
        *   **Maintenance:** Activities for organizations providing maintenance services for software products.
    *   **Framework:** Consists of three main process categories: Primary, Supporting, and Organizational Life Cycle Processes, with 20 subprocesses in total.
