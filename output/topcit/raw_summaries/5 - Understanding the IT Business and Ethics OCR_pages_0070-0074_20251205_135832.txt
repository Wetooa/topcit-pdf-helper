## IT Business Monitoring, Management, and Improvement Techniques

This guide covers key concepts related to monitoring, managing, and improving IT business processes.

---

### **Section 1: IT Business Monitoring & Management**

#### **1.1 Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)**

*   **What it is:** A technique that monitors business processes in real-time to identify bottlenecks and recognize risks in advance.
*   **Purpose:** Uses advanced business intelligence (BI) for real-time analysis and manages process flow for Business Process Monitoring (BPM).
*   **Base Technologies:**
    *   **Business Intelligence (BI):** Analyzes key business process indicators.
    *   **Data Warehouse:** Collects and analyzes statistical data to identify risks.
    *   **Business Process Management (BPM):** Analyzes business events and suggests process improvements.
    *   **System Infrastructure:** Manages the network and integrated system, collects, analyzes, and visualizes data and events.

#### **1.2 Business Rule Engine (BRE)**

*   **What it is:** A technique to manage, automate, and optimize processes by formalizing complex business rules and process flows.
*   **Why it's needed:** Addresses the increasing volume of information and complexity of process flows, enabling rule-based management.
*   **Benefits:** Helps enterprises proactively manage changes, reduce operating costs, and improve services.
*   **Component Elements:**
    *   **Rule Manager:** Develops and manages business rules, handles the process lifecycle, and manages the rule repository.
    *   **Rule Service:** Acts as a server for the rule engine, provides interfaces between processes, and distributes implemented rules.
    *   **Rule Monitoring:** Supports process improvement, performance tuning, and provides analysis/statistical functions.
    *   **Rule Repository:** A storage location for business rules.

### **Section 2: IT Business Process Information Management**

As IT business processes become more complex and respond rapidly to changes, systematized data management is crucial. This is achieved through ILM or IRM.

#### **2.1 Information Life Cycle Management (ILM)**

*   **What it is:** A series of processes for managing storage media by separating data based on its changing value throughout its life cycle.
*   **Purpose:** To reduce data management costs and systematically manage data as its volume increases but its value changes over time.
*   **Constituent Elements:**
    *   **Management Policies:**
        *   **IT Governance:** Provides guidelines for data generation, storage, and disposal.
        *   **IT Compliance:** Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and policy standards.
        *   **Enterprise Data Management Policy:** Defines data operation policies, often related to Enterprise Architecture (EA).
    *   **Technology Elements:**
        *   **1st Storage:** High-performance, expensive storage for high-utilization, frequently accessed data.
        *   **2nd Storage:** Lower-performance, less expensive storage for data with relatively low utilization and value.
        *   **Data Archiving:** Technology for periodic, automatic archiving of data.
        *   **Backup:** Separate storage (e.g., tape library, affordable disk) for data protection.

#### **2.2 Information Resource Management (IRM)**

*   **What it is:** The efficient and integrated management of all IT resources.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Prevent redundant IT investments.
    *   Increase returns on IT investments (ROI).
    *   Manage diverse IT resources, including human resources, equipment, budgets, and outputs.
*   **Why it's needed:** Addresses the growing complexity and scale of enterprise information systems and the need for systematized management.
*   **Function:** Provides a common standard and management system for all informatization procedures (planning, development, performance evaluation).
*   **Relationship with Enterprise Architecture (EA):** IRM provides the framework for information resources to EA, while EA gives IRM guidelines for enterprise resource schemes. They complement each other.
*   **IRM Process for EA (Key Activities & Outputs):**
    *   **Information Resource Planning:** Develop strategies and objectives.
        *   *Output:* Information resource management plan.
    *   **Set up Organization Structure:** Form teams and committees, appoint chief architect.
        *   *Output:* Team organization chart, work assignment chart.
    *   **Set up Architecture:** Define AS-IS (current state) and To-BE (future state) architectures, plan conversion.
        *   *Output:* Architecture analysis report, conversion plan.
    *   **Utilize Architecture:** Implement investment plans, develop and use information resources.
        *   *Output:* Utilization guidelines.
    *   **Architecture Maintenance:** Continuously update and manage the architecture, evaluate its link to information resources.
        *   *Output:* Report on information resource utilization.
    *   **Evaluation of Information Resource Management:** Assess performance, develop improvement plans.
        *   *Output:* Evaluation report.

### **Section 3: IT Business Process Improvement Techniques**

Enterprises constantly seek to improve business processes for competitiveness, efficiency, and developing new business models.

#### **3.1 Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**

*   **Origin:** Introduced by Professor Michael Hammer in 1990 to address declining competitiveness by rethinking fundamental business processes.
*   **Concept:** A technique for **fundamentally redesigning business processes** to achieve **radical improvements** in performance indicators like cost, quality, service, and speed.
*   **Four Attributes of BPR:**
    *   **Basic:** Addresses core problems, questions the fundamental purpose of tasks, and identifies inefficiencies.
    *   **Zero Base:** Designs entirely new ways of performing tasks by abandoning existing procedures.
    *   **Dramatic Improvement:** Aims for absolute, radical innovation, not gradual enhancements.
    *   **Process:** Focuses on improving task processes, not just jobs, workers, or organizational structures, to internalize business values.
*   **Implementation Procedure:**
    1.  **Set Corporate Objectives:** Define vision and redesign goals (e.g., reduce costs, save time, improve quality).
    2.  **Select Target Process:** Identify and prioritize key processes for redesign.
    3.  **Understand Current Process:** Analyze how the selected process currently operates and evaluate its performance.
    4.  **Select Process Goals:** Link corporate vision to specific improvement goals for the process.
    5.  **Design Improved Process:** Create a new process design to achieve the selected goals, and pilot a prototype.
    6.  **Develop Change Model:** Address potential resistance from employees or technological issues.
    7.  **Implement:** Transition from the old process to the new, improved one, including strategies for risk reduction.
    8.  **Operate:** Run the new prototype and establish quality control management.

#### **3.2 Process Innovation (PI)**

*   **Origin:** Introduced by David Port in 1993.
*   **Concept:** Activity focused on improving the business environment to maximize corporate value by eliminating unnecessary elements (in processes, organization, and IT) and rebuilding effective business processes.
*   **BPR vs. PI:**
    *   Similar to BPR but places **greater emphasis on the integration of information technology**.
    *   Aims to build a structure that can respond to changes by making processes more customer-centric, improving information, logistics, and value flows.
    *   Internationally, BPR is widely used; in South Korea, PI gained popularity, often used in a broader sense than BPR (e.g., with ERP deployments).
*   **Example of PI Implementation Procedure (integrates IT):**
    1.  **AS-IS Analysis:** Analyze current systems, processes, and human resources; set Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
    2.  **PI To-BE Process Design:** Design the future-state process, focusing on achieving the defined CSFs and KPIs.
    3.  **Organization/Strategy (Information Strategy Plan - ISP):** Establish IT strategies aligned with business goals; develop mid-term and long-term information system plans and an IT architecture roadmap.
    4.  **Implementation (Detailed Plan):** Create a detailed plan for establishing the integrated information system.
    5.  **Deployment:** Step-by-step deployment of the integrated information system (e.g., ERP, CRM).

Business  rule engine (BRE) is a technique  for effectively  managing,  automating,  and optimizing  processes  by
formalizing  the complex  business  rules and process  flows of an enterprise.  The ever increasing  volume  of information
processed  by IT business  processes  and the increasing  complexity  of process  flows have led to the need for rule-
based management.  Rule-based  management  is also needed for service improvements  and cost savings. For this
reason, the adoption  of BRE can help enterprises  to proactively  manage  changes  in, and reduce the operating  costs
of, business  processes.

B) IT business  process  information  management
As IT business  processes  become ever more complex  and have to respond rapidly to environmental  (both external
and internal)  changes, there is a growing  need for the systematized  management  of the data generated  by
such processes.  The data generated  by IT business  processes  can be managed  either by information  life cycle
management  (ILM) or by information  resource  management  (IRM).

@ Understanding  ILM
Information  life cycle management  (ILM) is a series of processes  for separating  and managing  storage media, which is
necessitated  by ongoing  changes  in the value of data or information  throughout  its life cycle.
As the volume of data increases,  so does the cost of managing  data. In contrast,  the value of data changes  as it
goes through  its life cycle. Thus, enterprises  are tuning  to ILM in order to reduce their data management  costs and
manage  data in a more systematic  way.

@ Understanding  IRM
The purpose  of information  resource  management  (IRM) is the efficient  and integrated  management  of IT resources.
Here, efficient  and integrated  management  means preventing  redundant  investments  in IT resources  and increasing
returns  on investments.  It also means managing  all types of IT resources  from HT resources  to IT equipment,  budgets
and outputs.
