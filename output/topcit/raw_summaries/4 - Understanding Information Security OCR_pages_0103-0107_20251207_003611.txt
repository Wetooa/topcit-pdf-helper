## Information Security Learning Guide

This guide summarizes essential information security practices for both general systems and Unix-like operating systems.

### 1. General System Security

#### A. Managing Unnecessary Services

*   **Problem:** Services installed by default that are not needed can create security vulnerabilities or waste system resources.
*   **Action:** Identify and stop/disable all unnecessary system services.
*   **How to Stop Services (Windows Example):**
    1.  Go to `Start` and search for `services.msc`.
    2.  Locate the unnecessary service in the list.
    3.  Stop the service.
    4.  Change its "Startup type" to "Disabled".

#### B. Checking Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services)

*   **Problem:** Remote Desktop Services, if not properly secured (e.g., with weak passwords or poor access control), can be exploited for hacking.
*   **Action:**
    *   Verify if Remote Desktop Services are truly necessary.
    *   If used, ensure the encryption level is set to "Medium" or higher.

### 2. Unix-like System Security

Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Unix, Linux) are commonly used as servers and require robust security management. Key areas include:

*   Account & Password Management
*   Access Controls
*   System Security
*   Service Security
*   Monitoring
*   Other Security Management (e.g., patches, warning messages)

#### A. Account and Password Management

1.  **Deleting Unnecessary Accounts**
    *   **Problem:** Default accounts (from OS or package installation) often use default or easily guessable passwords, making them targets for password guessing attacks. Suspicious accounts also pose a risk.
    *   **Action:** Delete any accounts not essential for system operation. Prohibit login for system accounts that don't require interactive access.
    *   **How to Delete Accounts (Examples):**
        *   **SUN/HP-UX:** `# userdel [account_name]`
        *   **AIX:** `# rmuser [account_name]`

2.  **Checking for Vulnerable Passwords**
    *   **Problem:** Easy-to-guess passwords allow unauthorized users to access the system.
    *   **Recommendation:** Passwords should be 8+ characters, combining letters, numbers, and special characters, and not be similar to the account name.
    *   **How to Check (Using a Cracking Tool):**
        1.  Use a password cracking tool like "john the ripper".
        2.  Create a `password.txt` file in the same directory as the tool.
        3.  Copy the encrypted password contents from `/etc/shadow` (or `/etc/passwd` for HP-UX) into `password.txt`.
        4.  Run the tool: `john password.txt`.

#### B. Access Control

1.  **Allowing Access to Authorized Systems Only**
    *   **Concept:** The `inetd` daemon manages internet services, executing them when requested.
    *   **Problem:** Incorrect access rights for `inetd.conf` (or `xinetd.d`) can allow unauthorized users to run malicious programs with root privileges.
    *   **Action:** Use `/etc/hosts.allow` to specify permitted systems/users and `/etc/hosts.deny` to block unauthorized access.

2.  **Setting Session Idle Timeout**
    *   **Problem:** Unused, active sessions can lead to confidentiality or availability issues if not automatically disconnected.
    *   **Action:** Configure sessions to automatically terminate or block if idle for a specified period.
    *   **How to Set (Examples):**
        *   **SUN:** Add `TIMEOUT=300` (300 seconds) to the `/etc/default/login` file.
        *   **HP-UX, AIX, Linux:** Add `TMOUT=300; export TMOUT` to `/etc/profile` or `.profile`.

#### C. System Security

1.  **Setting Privileges for the User's Default Configuration File (`/etc/profile`)**
    *   **Concept:** `/etc/profile` is a script that sets the default environment for all users upon login.
    *   **Problem:** Incorrect access rights on `/etc/profile` allow unauthorized users to modify user environments, potentially causing security breaches.
    *   **Action:** Remove write privileges for `/etc/profile` from all users except root (or 'bin').
    *   **How to Remove Write Privileges:**
        *   `# ls -al /etc/profile` (to view current permissions)
        *   `# chown root /etc/profile` (set owner to root)
        *   `# chmod o-w /etc/profile` (remove write permission for "others")

2.  **Setting umask**
    *   **Concept:** `umask` controls the default permissions assigned to newly created files and directories.
    *   **Action:** Set the `umask` value to `027` or `022`. `022` is generally preferred to prevent unnecessary access while allowing read access to groups and others.
        *   `umask 027`: Creates files with `rw-r-----` (owner: read/write, group: read, others: no access).
        *   `umask 022`: Creates files with `rw-r--r--` (owner: read/write, group: read, others: read).
    *   **How to Set:**
        *   **SUN:** Uncomment the `UMASK` option in `/etc/default/login` and set it to `022`.
        *   **Other UNIX systems:** Add `Umask 022` to the `profile` file.

#### D. Service Security

1.  **Stopping Unnecessary Services**
    *   **Problem:** Open ports for unused services create potential security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **Action:** Identify and disable or remove any services not actively in use.
    *   **Examples of Services to Check for Disabling:** Echo (port 7), Chargen (19), Finger (79), NNTP (119), LDAP (389), NFS (2049), Discard (9), Time (37), TFTP (69), Printer (515), UUCP (540), Ingreslock (1524), Talk (517).

2.  **Restricting Anonymous FTP and Using Secure FTP (SFTP)**
    *   **Problem with Anonymous FTP:** Allows malicious users to gather system information, and write permissions can enable various attacks. Standard FTP transmits user authentication in plain text, making it vulnerable to sniffing, brute force, and authentication exploits.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Restrict anonymous FTP access to only truly necessary users.
        *   **Always use Secure FTP (SFTP)** instead of standard FTP for file transfers. SFTP encrypts data and credentials, addressing FTP's security flaws.
    *   **SFTP Implementation (Concept):**
        *   Install an SFTP server.
        *   Use an SFTP client program (many open-source libraries are available, e.g., Apache Commons-Net for Java, to build custom clients).

Information  security )
Unnecessary  services  should be stopped,  because  unnecessary  system  services  can be installed  and executed
by default, and these services can become  a security  vulnerability  in the system, or they can waste system
resources.  It is recommended  not to use the service installed  by default, or the services  that are not used for
a specific purpose.  The system administrator  should accurately  identify  the purpose  of the target system and
remove  unnecessary  services.
+ How to stop unnecessary  startup  services
Input services.msc  into the search programs  and files box by selecting  [Start].
Stop the unnecessary  service  on the list and change  “Startup  type” to “Disabled”.
F) Checking  the terminal  service
Remote Desktop  Services  is a tool used to manage remote servers. However,  if a weak password  is used or
access control is not adequate,  it can be exploited  as a hacking  tool. Therefore, it should be checked  whether
unnecessary  Remote  Desktop  Services  is used or not. If Remote  Desktop  Services  is used, the encryption  level
should be set to “Medium”  or higher.
02 Unix-like  system  security
A) Overview  of Unix-like  system  security
Unix-like  operating  systems,  which are widely used as server operating systems,  include Unix and Linux-
like operating  systems.  Security  management  is needed in various areas, such as account  and password
management,  access  controls,  system  security,  service security,  monitoring,  and other security  management.

ESSENCE
B) Account  and password  management
© Deleting  unnecessary  accounts
In many cases, accounts  created by default when installing  the OS or package,  use the default password.
Accounts  that are not deleted by the system as well as suspicious accounts  should be deleted,  because  they
can be exploited  for the password  guessing  attack. In general,  system accounts  that do not require login should
be prohibited  from logging  in.
+ How to delete unnecessary  accounts
# userdel [Ip | uucp | nuucp | Account  to be deleted]  on SUN/HP-UX.
# rmuser  [Ip | uucp | nuucp | Account  to be deleted]  on AIX.
@ Checking  the account  that uses a vulnerable  password
In general,  if a password  that is easy to guess is set for an account,  unauthorized  users can access  the system.
A password  should be set using a combination of 8 or more letters, numbers,  and special characters  that are
not the same or similar to the account  name.
+ How to check the account  that uses a vulnerable  password  method:
Check the password,  using a password  cracking  tool, such as “john the ripper’.
Create a password.txt  file in the same directory  as the john script.
Copy the contents  of the password  encryption  file /etc/shadow  (/etc/passwd  for HP-UX), paste it into the
password.txt  file, and input john password.  txt.
C) Access  control
@ Allowing  access  to authorized  systems  only
The Inetd daemon  executes  the Internet  service  daemon,  which is an internal program  registered  in /etc/inetd.
conf, when requested by the external network.  If the access rights of inetd.conf(xinetd.d)  are incorrectly  set,
unauthorized  persons  can register  a malicious  program  in this file and execute  it with root privileges.  Therefore,
include those who will be allowed  to access  in the /etc/hosts.  allow and include those who will be denied in the
/etc/hosts.  deny file.
@ Setting  session  idle timeout
If timeout  is not set for a session that is not in use, it may cause problems,  both in confidentiality  and
availability.  Therefore,  the connected session should be set in a way that it is blocked from the server in
question,  if not used for a specified  period  of time.
+ How to set session  idle timeout
Add “TIMEOUT=300"  (stop sessions  if not used for 300 seconds)  to the “/etc/default/login’  file.
Add “TMOUT=300,  export TMOUT”  to the /etc/profile  or .profile file in HP-UX, AIX, and Linux.
