## Software Development Learning Guide

### Section 1: eXtreme Programming (XP)

**XP Core Concepts:**

*   **User stories:** Brief descriptions of necessary functions, used for requirements gathering and communication.
*   **Spike:** A simple program to explore difficult requirements or potential solutions, reducing technical risk and increasing user story reliability.
*   **Release planning:** Establishes a project deployment plan, dividing iterations into 1-3 weeks and keeping them consistent.
*   **Acceptance test:** Customer-performed test before release.
*   **Smaller releases:** Frequent small-scale releases to provide early benefits to the customer.

**XP Values:**
XP emphasizes five core values:

1.  **Communication:** Crucial for team-level software development. Solves problems and strengthens team building among customers, developers, and managers.
2.  **Simplicity:** Always strive for the simplest possible solution. Keep designs clear by removing unnecessary complexity.
3.  **Feedback:** Prioritize gradual improvement over perfection. Create and use quick feedback loops for continuous enhancement.
4.  **Courage:** Actively cope with and reflect changes in requirements and technology quickly. This includes the courage for simplicity and presenting solutions.
5.  **Respect:** The underlying value for the other four. Proper project implementation requires respect among team members.

**XP Practices:**
XP suggests twelve practices in addition to its values:

*   **Simple design:** Design only for current requirements, keeping it as simple as possible.
*   **Test-driven development (TDD):** Write test programs *before* writing code, then automate tests using tools.
*   **Refactoring:** Redesign existing code to eliminate duplication and complexity.
*   **Coding standard:** Establish consistent coding rules for effective communication.
*   **Pair programming:** Two developers work together at one computer.
*   **Collective code ownership:** All developers share responsibility for the source code and can modify it to improve it.
*   **Continuous integration:** Integrate code frequently, often after every small change.
*   **Planning game:** Establish and update project and cycle plans considering business and technical aspects, using feedback.
*   **Small release:** Deploy executable modules quickly for frequent customer experience feedback.
*   **Metaphor:** Express the system's overall look using easily understandable pictures and stories.
*   **40 hours/week:** Limit work to 40 hours per week to maintain quality.
*   **On-site customer:** Have the customer (actual user) stay at the development site.

### Section 2: Scrum

**Scrum Overview:**

*   **Definition:** An agile methodology for project management, known as an empirical management technique based on estimation and adjustment.
*   **Origin:** Modeled after "The New Product Development Game" (1986); introduced for software by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in 1995.

**Scrum Units (Roles):**

*   **Product Owner:** Manages the Product Backlog (product function list), adjusts priorities, and adds new items. Should be key in sprint planning but minimally involved in team operation once a sprint starts.
*   **Scrum Master:** Removes impediments that disturb the team's work. Supports the development team while upholding Scrum principles and values.
*   **Scrum Team:** Typically 5-9 members. Identifies functions to be developed during a sprint using user stories.

**Scrum Process Components:**

1.  **Sprint:** A repetitive development period, typically 1 to 4 weeks long.
2.  **Three Meetings:**
    *   **Sprint Planning:** Goals are set for the sprint, and items are selected from the Product Backlog. Tasks are defined, assigned, and planned.
    *   **Daily Scrum:** A 15-minute daily meeting to share project progress. Team members discuss what they did, what they will do, and any issues.
    *   **Sprint Review:** Checks work progress and deliverables against sprint goals. The Scrum team demonstrates completed work to attendees (including the customer) and receives feedback. A retrospective review identifies successes, disappointments, and areas for improvement.
3.  **Three Deliverables:**
    *   **Product Backlog:** A breakdown of all work to be done for the product. The Product Owner prioritizes items (called user stories). Workload is often estimated using 'story points'.
    *   **Sprint Backlog:** A list of user stories and associated tasks to be developed during a specific sprint. Task sizes are estimated in hours.
    *   **Burndown Chart:** Shows remaining work in the Sprint Backlog, typically for each iteration as story points.

**Scrum Characteristics:**

*   **Transparency:** Uses techniques like Scrum meetings, burndown charts, and sprint reviews to make project status, progress, and issues clear.
*   **Timeboxing:** Limits the time for activities to maintain focus (e.g., 15-minute Daily Scrum, periodic Sprint Review).
*   **Communication:** Fosters smooth communication among team members (e.g., daily problem sharing, planning poker for user story estimation).
*   **Empirical model:** Emphasizes the experience of individuals, adapting to unique project situations rather than relying solely on standardized processes. Acknowledges that actual implementation may differ between teams.

### Section 3: Recent Trends & Issues

**Software Reuse:**

*   **Trend:** Increasingly common as businesses globalize.
*   **Purpose:** Develop new features and maintain existing ones using proven knowledge from past projects.
*   **Benefits:** Reduces costs, improves productivity, enhances quality, and enables faster reproduction of software. Enterprises aim to increase their reuse rate.

**Keywords:**

*   Reuse, reverse engineering
*   Code reuse, software standardization
*   Software maintenance

+ User stories: Refers to a tool for collecting  requirements  and communication.  User stories briefly describe
necessary  matters  regarding  functions.
+ Spike: A simple program  that considers  difficult  requirements  or potential  solutions.  Spike aims to increase
the reliability  of user stories while reducing  the risk of technical  problems.
+ Release planning:  Establishes  a deployment  plan for an entire project and divides one iteration  into one to
three weeks,  and then keeps the iterations  evenly.
+ Acceptance  test: An acceptance  test performed  by the customer  before release.
+ Smaller  releases:  The final phase of the XP cycle. If frequently  released  on a small scale, several benefits  can
be provided  to the customer  in the early stages.
@ XP values
Basically,  eXtreme  Programming  proposes  the following  five values.
* Communication:  Communication  is the most important  thing in software  development  at the team level.
Communication  errors are typically  found in failed projects.  Problems  should be solved, and team building
should be strengthened  through  communication  between  customers,  developers  and managers.
+ Simplicity:  Always ask “What is the simplest  thing possible?”.  Keep the design simple and clear by removing
unnecessary  complexity.
+ Feedback:  Gradual improvement  is more effective  than pursuing  perfection,  considering  the flow of changes
which causes yesterday's  output or value to become  useless  today. Create as many feedback  as possible
quickly  as long as they can be handled  by the team and use them for improvement.
+ Courage:  Cope with changes  to the requirements  and technology  to reflect them as quickly as possible
and deliver to the customer.  The courage to actively  solve a problem entails simplicity,  and the courage  to
present  the solution  concretely  reinforces  feedback.
+ Respect:  Respect  is the value that hides behind the first four. A person cannot implement  the project
properly  without  respecting  the other members  of the team. (Source: Korea Developer's  Hope Report)

C) Scrum
@ Scrum overview
Scrum is one of the agile methodologies  designed  for project management  and is a representative  type
of empirical  management  technique  based on estimation  and adjustment.  Scrum for software  was directly
modeled  after “The New Product  Development  Game’ by Hirotaka Takeuchi  and Ikujiro Nonaka  published  in the
Harvard Business  Review in 1986. This method was named “Scrum”  when it was introduced  by Ken Schwaber
and Jeff Sutherland  for software  development  in 1995. Scrum consists  of three fundamental  units, as shown in
<Table 3>.
<Table 3> Type of Scrum units
Roles Description
The product  owner manages  the creation  of a product  backlog  corresponding  to the product
function  list, priority  adjustment,  or new item addition.
It is recommended  that the product  owner  should play a key role when setting  up a splint plan, but
should be involved  in team operation  as little as possible  once the sprint starts.
