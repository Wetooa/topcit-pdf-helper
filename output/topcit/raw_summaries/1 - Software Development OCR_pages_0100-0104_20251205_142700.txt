# Software Development & Testing: A Learning Guide

## Part 1: Software Development Basics

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
**Definition:** CI is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

**Components of CI:**
*   **SCM (Source Control Management):** Manages source code versions (e.g., Git).
*   **Artifacts:** The outputs of a build process (e.g., executable files, libraries).
*   **Configuration Repository:** Stores configuration files.
*   **Deployment:** The process of making software available for use.

**CI Server:**
*   **Purpose:** Required to perform Continuous Integration.
*   **Functions:** Conducts daily builds.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   At least one accessible source code repository.
    *   Build script sets and build procedures.
    *   A test suite for built artifacts.

### 2. Software Build
**Definition:** The process of converting source code files into independent, executable software artifacts.

**Benefits of a Software Build (especially daily builds):**
*   Reduces integration risks.
*   Prevents quality deterioration.
*   Monitors initial fault analysis progress.
*   Boosts developer morale.

### 3. Daily Build & Operation Test
**Definition:** The process of comprehensively compiling software daily and running tests to verify basic operation.

**Benefits:**
*   Increases project efficiency.
*   Improves customer satisfaction.
*   Reduces risks like:
    *   Software integration failure.
    *   Poor quality.
    *   Low project visibility.
*   Saves time.

**Applicability:** Can be used for all project sizes (large, small, off-the-shelf, business systems).

### 4. Software Deployment
**Definition:** Any activity involved in creating a software system to be used. The exact procedures vary by system and customer requirements.

**Common Deployment Activities:**
*   Release
*   Installation & Activation
*   Deactivation
*   Uninstallation
*   Update (including built-in updates)
*   Version Tracking
*   Retirement

## Part 2: Introduction to Software Testing

### 1. Recent Trends & Importance
*   **Increased Investment:** Time, money, and effort spent on software testing are steadily rising.
*   **Specialized Teams:** IT companies recognize testing's importance by forming dedicated QA (Quality Assurance) teams or departments.

### 2. Why Testing Fails: Common Challenges in Enterprises
Despite its importance, software testing often faces issues:
*   **High Cost vs. Low Focus:** Testing can account for 40-60%+ of total development cost, but developers often prioritize fixed tasks, showing little interest beyond unit testing.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Development often runs with insufficient personnel, resources, and shorter-than-actual schedules, leaving little room for testing investment.
*   **Lack of Tester Knowledge:** Testers sometimes lack deep knowledge of testing principles and techniques.
*   **Managerial Misunderstanding:** Decision-makers/managers may not fully recognize testing's importance, sometimes halting efforts.
*   **Organizational Issues:** Irrational contracts, frequent requirement changes, unreasonable customer demands, limited organizational support, impractical procedures, and excessive reporting hinder effective testing.
*   **Increased Workload:** Service operation and development teams internally handle testing; limited staff, more channels, increasing workloads, and shortened test periods lead to incomplete services and higher maintenance costs.
*   **Perception as Expense:** Companies often view testing as an unnecessary additional expense rather than a vital investment.

### 3. The Shifting Landscape: Modern Demands
*   **Software's Expansion:** Software is moving beyond traditional domains into IoT, big data, mobile, and cloud (home appliances, medical devices, etc.).
*   **Increased Emphasis:** Enterprises now place greater importance on improving development/operation efficiency and software quality.
*   **Rising Expectations:** Users' expectations are higher, demanding systematic software testing.
*   **Consequences:** This leads to increased investment, recruitment of professional staff, use of automated tools, and establishment of robust testing processes.

## Part 3: Understanding Software Testing

### 1. Concept of Testing
**Definition:** A method to check or confirm that an application or system's operation, performance, and stability satisfy user/customer demands by identifying defects or faults.

### 2. General Principles of Testing
These principles guide effective software testing:

1.  **Testing shows the presence of defects:** Testing helps find defects, but it's almost impossible to prove the *absence* of all defects.
2.  **Exhaustive testing is not possible:** Even simple programs cannot be tested for all possible cases due to the sheer number of combinations.
3.  **Testing should start early in development:** Early testing (shifting left) reduces the development period, prevents defects, and lowers costs.
4.  **Pesticide Paradox:** Repeatedly using the same tests will eventually stop finding *new* defects, just as insects become resistant to pesticides. Test cases must be regularly reviewed and updated.
5.  **Testing is context-dependent:** The approach, methodology, and severity of testing vary significantly based on the software's field or purpose (e.g., medical device software vs. a simple mobile app).
6.  **Absence of error - fallacy:** Finding and fixing many defects is useless if the "system build" doesn't meet the user's actual needs or is unusable. The right problems must be solved.

### 3. The Testing Process
*   Testing requires a coordinated and managed process.
*   This process comprises various components and main activities (e.g., planning, design, execution, reporting).

Continuous  Integration  Server
A Cl server is required  to perform Cl (Continuous  Integration)  that can conduct  daily build, which requires at
least one accessible  source code repository,  as well as build script sets and build procedures,  and a test suite
for built artifacts.
C) Software  build
“Software  build’ refers to the process  of converting  source code files into independent  software  artifacts  that
can be executed  on a computer, or the results thereof. As one of the software  quality assurance  activities,
a daily build reduces integration  risks, prevents quality deterioration,  monitors  the progress  of initial fault
analysis, and boosts  the morale of developers.
D) Daily build and operation  test
+ The process  of comprehensively  compiling  software  products  again every day and running  a series of tests to
verify basic operation.
+ Daily build can simultaneously  increase  a project's  efficiency  and improve  customer  satisfaction,  primarily  by
reducing  such risks as software  integration  failure, poor quality, and low project  visibility,  and by saving time.
* The daily build and operation  test can be utilized for all projects,  including  large-size  projects,  small-size
projects,  off-the-shelf  software,  and business  systems.
E) Software  deployment
“Software  deployment’  refers to any act of creating  a software  system to be used, where the deployment
process  is composed  of interactions  together  with possible  transitions  between  them. These activities  can
take place either from the developers’  point of view or the consumers’  point of view. It is difficult  to define with
any exactitude  the deployment  procedures  for each activity  because  deployment  is unique to every software
system. Therefore,  “deployment”  should be understood  as a general procedure  that can be defined by the
specific requirements  or characteristics  of the customer  or user. Software  deployment  activities  include release,
installation  and activation,  deactivation,  uninstallation,  update,  built-in update,  version  tracking, and retirement.

+ Preview  for practical  business The necessity  of software  testing  and
the reality of enterprises
In March 2005, bus companies  lost KRW 500 million won per day in free rides caused by faults or
failures  of T-Money  bus terminal  software.
In October  2007, Toyota Motors  paid with an operator  USD 1.6 billion in compensation  due to the
sudden  unintended  acceleration  of the “Camry”  model’s  ECM firmware  fault.
In August 2009, the launch of “Naro”, Korea’s  first space launch vehicle,  was delayed  due to a
software  fault in the automatic  launch device software  related  to pressure  measurement.
The abovementioned  incidents  are widely publicized  cases of software  faults. Software is ubiquitous
and directly related to the existence  of companies  and the daily life of countless  individuals.  The
most obvious  question  that springs to mind is why such faults even occur when software  is so
important.  Everyone  thinks they know software  testing well. However,  when software  testing is
actually  performed,  it is not performed  as well as expected due to various problems.  Currently,
enterprises  are facing many problems  due to the irrationality  of the contract  itself, frequent  changes
to the requirements  and the unreasonable  demands  of customers,  the limitations  of support at
the organizational  level, impractical  procedures  and paperwork,  numerous  cases of reporting  and
meetings,  and reports on such reporting  and meetings.  More specifically,  enterprises  have difficulty  in
running  software  testing  due to the following  reasons.
+ It is a well-known  fact that anywhere  from 40% to 60% or more of the total development  cost is
spent on software  testing, ...
