### II. Overview of System Architecture

**A. Why Big Data Systems?**
*   **Business Need:** Companies need to collect, store, analyze, and utilize customer and market data to gain a competitive edge and develop new strategies (e.g., marketing).
*   **Infrastructure:** Requires expanding infrastructure beyond traditional databases and hiring analysts.

**B. Big Data System Structure: The Hadoop Ecosystem**

*   **Hadoop Definition:** A Java-based, open-source framework for distributed processing of large volumes of data across multiple distributed storage units.
*   **Initial Components:** Hadoop started with:
    1.  **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):** For data storage.
    2.  **MapReduce:** For data processing.
*   **Evolution (Ecosystem):** As specialists found it difficult to use, various peripheral modules were developed and packaged with Hadoop.
    *   **Purpose:** These modules support data integration, migration, application management, and system management.
*   **Key Idea:** The Hadoop Ecosystem is a collection of interrelated open-source projects designed to handle big data challenges (storage, processing, analysis, etc.).

### III. Hadoop's Main Technology Elements

**A. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
*   **Purpose:** A distributed file system for storing data across devices in a Hadoop network.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Data Loss Prevention:** Stores replicated data on multiple nodes.
    *   **Access:** Requires streaming access to store or query files.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Stored data is primarily read-only (ensuring integrity). Version 2.0+ allows appending to files.
    *   **File Management:** Provides interfaces to move, delete, and copy files.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   **NameNode (Master):**
        *   Manages all HDFS metadata (directory names, file names, block locations).
        *   Clients access files by consulting the NameNode.
    *   **DataNode (Slaves):**
        *   Stores actual data blocks.
        *   Periodically sends "block reports" to the NameNode to confirm normal operation.
    *   **Client Interaction:** Hadoop applications use HDFS clients (APIs) to store or read files. Clients log into the NameNode to find block locations, then directly query the relevant DataNode for data.

**B. MapReduce**
*   **Purpose:** A distributed programming model and software framework for parallel processing and analysis of large volumes of data in a distributed computing environment.
*   **Components:** Programmers write two main methods:
    1.  **Map:**
        *   Classifies scattered data into relevant data, typically in <Key, Value> pairs.
    2.  **Reduce:**
        *   Removes duplicate data from the Map output.
        *   Extracts or aggregates the desired data.
*   **Example Process (Word Count):**
    1.  **Input Splitting:** Divides input data (e.g., string data by line).
    2.  **Mapping:** Processes each line, outputting <Word, 1> for each word.
    3.  **Shuffling:** Groups data by key (e.g., all "DOG" entries together).
    4.  **Reducing:** Calculates the sum for each key (e.g., counts total occurrences of "DOG").
    5.  **Final Result:** Combines and stores the output in HDFS.

    *   **Hiho:** Large-capacity structured data collection and transfer solution.

**B. Distributed Databases**
*   **Hbase:** HDFS-based, column-based NoSQL database (based on Google's BigTable paper). Used by Yahoo, Twitter, NHN (Linedatabase).
*   **Cassandra:** Open-source distributed database (NoSQL), hybrid of column-centered and row-centered.

**C. Real-time SQL Query**
*   **Impala:** Real-time SQL query system developed by Cloudera, uses its own engine instead of MapReduce.

**J. Serialization**
*   **Avro:** Framework supporting serialization of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and data.

**K. Resource Manager**
*   **YARN:** Resource management platform for distributed computing environments, manages computing resources and schedules user applications within clusters.

>> Recent  trends and issues
Modern society had passed the Big Data 1.0 era, when the quantitative  explosion  of big data began and
entered  the Big Data 2.0 era, which creates  practical  values from big data.
The introduction  of Hadoop  2.2 has made big data technology  more sophisticated  and diversified  the
professional  services  of the big data vendors  from the big data supply aspect, leading  to the emergence  of
companies  that specialize  in big data. The demand  for big data is rapidly increasing  as large companies  are
quickly  adopting  the technology,  mainly in the financial  and services  industries.
Companies  that have adopted  big data are practically  using big data for business  through pilot tests,
beyond  simply using big data for information  collection.  Governments  are implementing  policies  to promote
R&D and professional  training,  building  industry-academia-R&D  governance,  and public data disclosure.
Of course, big data expansion  has produced  side effects,  such as privacy  infringement  and personal  profiling,
Therefore,  it is necessary  to strengthen  theflexibility  of data use by establishing  a new concept  for personal
data use. Comprehensive  policy support  that reflects  the social and market  environments  is necessary  for
the big data ecosystem  to evolve.

Overview  of System Architecture )
+ Practical  preview
Company  A is an online retailer Until recently,  it competed  for the No. 1 or 2 position  in the domestic
market, but has experienced  declining  sales, due to the influence  of cheap imports  from China entering
the domestic  online market.  Therefore,  the company  needs a new competitive  edge. Firstly, it wants to
establish  a new marketing  strategy  by collecting and analyzing  customer  data. It intends to expand the
infrastructure  in order to collect big data beyond the existing  database  and to hire analysts  from outside
to analyze  the collected  data. This case shows why enterprises  seek to find ways to collect, store, analyze,
and utilize big data. This chapter  describes  the big data system  in more detail.
01 Bid Data System  Structure
A) Hadoop  ecosystem
Understanding  the big data system structure  begins with understanding  the Hadoop ecosystem.  Hadoop,  the
abbreviation  of High-availability  distributed  object-oriented  platform,  refers to a Java-based  framework  for the
distributed  processing  of a large volume  of data in multiple  distributed  storage.  It is an initial solution  and consists  of
the Hadoop  distributed  file system (HDFS) and Map Reduce.  However,  these two modules  are based on open source,
and it was difficult  for non-specialists  to utilize big data. The modules  are packaged  with various peripheral  modules,
as shown in [Figure 100], to solve the problem.  These peripheral  modules  support  data integration  and migration,
application  management,  and system  management,  and they have been developed  as part of the Hadoop  project.

B) Hadoop’s  main technology  elements
@ HDFS
HDFS is a distributed  file system  to store data in the devices  connected  to the Hadoop  network.
+ HDFS prevents  data loss by also storing  replicated  data in multiple  nodes.
+ It is necessary  to access  data through  streaming  in order to store files in HDFS or query the stored files.
+ The data integrity  is ensured  as stored data cannot  be modified  and can be read-only.  (Version  2.0 or higher  allows
appending  to the saved file.)
+ Although  it does not allow data modification, it provides  an interface  to move, delete, and copy files,
As shown in [Figure 101], HDFS consists  of one NameNode  serverthat  serves as a master, and multiple  DataNode
servers, that serve as slaves. The NameNode  server manages  all metadata  (the name of the directory  where the
blocks are stored, the file name, etc.) of HDFS, and the client can access the files stored in the HDFS by using it.
Hadoop  applications  use HDFS clients  to store files or to read the stored files in HDFS, and they provide  the clients  to
users in API. The DataNode  server periodically  transfers  a block report (information  of the block stored in the node)
from the NameNode,  which helps the NameNode  t...
