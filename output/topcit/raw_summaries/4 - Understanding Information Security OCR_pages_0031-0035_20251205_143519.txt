## Information Security: Hash Functions & Authentication

### 1. Hash Functions

**What is a Hash Function?**
*   A mathematical algorithm that converts an input (data of any size) into a fixed-size output, called a **hash value** or **message digest**.
*   **Key Property:** It's a **one-way function**. You cannot restore the original text from its hash value.

**Main Uses:**
*   **Safely store sensitive data:** Primarily passwords. Instead of storing the password itself, its hash value is stored.
*   **Integrity verification:** Check if data has been tampered with.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Hash Collision:** Two different input values produce the same hash output. This can lead to bypass attacks.

**Types of Hash Functions:**

*   **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**
    *   **Output Size:** 128-bit hash value.
    *   **Purpose:** Historically used for testing program/file integrity and saving passwords.
    *   **Status:** **Not recommended for security purposes** due to significant defects and known vulnerabilities. Safer algorithms like SHA-2 should be used.
    *   **Password Use:** Stores the MD5 hash of a password. When a user logs in, the entered password is hashed, and the result is compared to the stored hash.

*   **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**
    *   **Origin:** First designed by the NSA in 1993 (SHA-0).
    *   **Evolution:**
        *   **SHA-0:** The original 160-bit function.
        *   **SHA-1:** A variant of SHA-0, also 160-bit.
        *   **SHA-2:** A group of more secure variants, including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, with corresponding hash value lengths.
        *   **SHA-3:** A completely different algorithm confirmed in 2012, designed to be distinct from SHA-1/SHA-2.
    *   **Recommendation:** For safety, **use SHA-256 or higher** (from the SHA-2 family).
    *   **Security Note:** While no attacks on SHA-2 are reported, its similarity to SHA-1 suggests a potential future vulnerability.

**Supplementing Hash Functions with Salt**

*   **Salt:** An arbitrary, random bit string added to a password/message *before* hashing.
*   **Salting Process:** `hash(password + salt)`
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Prevents password recognition attacks:** Even if an attacker finds a hash, they can't directly verify the original password without the salt.
    *   **Differentiates identical passwords:** If different salts are used for each user, users with the same password will have different hash values, preventing dictionary attacks (e.g., rainbow tables) that pre-calculate common password hashes.
*   **Implementation:** The hash value of the password and its corresponding salt are stored in the database. When a user logs in, the input password is combined with the stored salt, hashed, and then compared to the stored hash.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Each password should have its own unique salt.
    *   Salt length should be 32 bytes or more.

### 2. Utilizing Hash Functions

**A. Integrity Verification Methods**
*   **Purpose:**
    1.  Detect errors during data transmission.
    2.  Prevent unauthorized modification of data.
*   **For Data Transmission Errors:**
    *   **Checksum:** A simple integrity test where data is added, converted to a bit value, and appended to the message. Receiver recalculates and compares.
    *   **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** Used in communication systems. A checksum is calculated based on polynomials and appended to the data. Receiver recalculates and compares to detect errors.
*   **For Preventing Unauthorized Modification:** Hash functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2) are primarily used for this.

**B. File Integrity Checks**
*   **Method:**
    1.  Calculate and store the hash values of important files (e.g., server source files).
    2.  Periodically recalculate the hash of the current files.
    3.  Compare the current hashes with the stored original hashes. Any mismatch indicates alteration.
*   **Limitations of Periodic Checks:**
    *   Cannot detect security incidents that occur *between* check periods.
    *   Frequent checks increase server load, especially with many files.
*   **Better Alternative:** **Real-time, kernel-level integrity checks.** Instead of periodic scanning, check file alteration whenever a file is executed or loaded into memory. This prevents tampered files from loading without constant CPU overhead.

**C. Integrity During Transmission**
*   **Problem:** Messages transmitted over a network can be intercepted and altered by hackers.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Sender:** Creates a hash of the message and transmits *both* the message and its hash.
    2.  **Receiver:** Receives the message and hash. Recalculates the hash of the received message.
    3.  **Verification:** Compares the calculated hash with the received hash. If they don't match, the message has been tampered with and should be ignored.
*   **Message Authentication Code (MAC):** A hash function can serve as a MAC when only data integrity (no tampering) is needed, not sender authentication. The sender's calculated hash acts as the MAC.

**D. Password-Based Encryption (PBE)**
*   **Hash vs. Encryption:**
    *   **Hash:** One-way; cannot recover original data.
    *   **Encryption:** Two-way; can encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext back to original.
*   **How PBE Works:** A hash value, obtained by combining a password and a salt (random number), is used as an encryption key. This method helps prevent password attacks by making the key derived from a salted hash.

**E. Electronic Signatures (Digital Signatures)**
*   **Purpose:** Provides both **data integrity** (proof of no tampering) and **signer authentication** (proof of sender's identity).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Sender:** Calculates a hash value of the message/document.
    2.  **Signing:** Uses their private key to encrypt (sign) *only the hash value* (not the entire message).
    3.  **Transmission:** Sends the original message along with the signed hash.
    4.  **Receiver:** Uses the sender's public key to decrypt the signed hash, revealing the original hash value. They also calculate a hash of the received message.
    5.  **Verification:** Compares the two hash values. If they match, the message is authentic and untampered, and the sender's identity is verified.
*   **Efficiency:** Signing the hash value is much more efficient than signing the entire message, especially for large documents, as public key operations are computationally intensive.

### 3. Authentication Technology

**A. Concept of Authentication**
*   **Definition:** The process of verifying:
    1.  That information exchanged between sender and receiver has not been altered or deleted (message integrity).
    2.  That the sender and receiver are legitimate (identity verification).
*   **Types:**
    *   Message Authentication
    *   User Authentication

**B. User Authentication**
*   **Definition:** A function that allows a user to prove their identity to another party (e.g., a server) over a network, preventing impersonation.
*   **Purpose:** To verify a user's identity for logging in, and to grant appropriate access privileges to information services.
*   **Importance:** Strict authentication procedures are crucial for remote users, as once authenticated, they gain full privileges.

**C. Message Authentication**
*   **Definition:** Checks whether the transmitted message content is the original information and has not been altered or modified.
*   **Method:** Electronic signatures are commonly used to verify both message integrity and sender identity.

**D. Types of Authentication Methods**
Authentication can be categorized based on *what the user provides* for verification:

*   **1. Knowledge-Based Authentication ("What you know")**
    *   Relies on information only the user should know.
    *   **Examples:** PIN (Personal Identification Number), password, account number.

*   **2. Ownership-Based Authentication ("What you have")**
    *   Relies on physical objects the user possesses.
    *   **Examples:** OTP (One-Time Password) device/token, smart card, card key.

*   **3. Presence-Based Authentication ("What you are" / Biometrics)**
    *   Relies on the user's unique physical or behavioral characteristics.
    *   **Examples:** Iris recognition, fingerprint recognition, voice recognition, face recognition.

restored  using the hash  value. That is, the original  text cannot be restored  through computation  using the hash
value.
Therefore,  the hash function  is mainly used to safely store sensitive  data, such as the password,  buta bypass
attack can be made using hash collision, which outputs  the same output  for two different  input values.
© Types of hash functions
+ MD5(Message  Digest Algorithm  5)
MD5 is a 128-bit hash function  used for testing the integrity  of the program  or file. It was designated  as
RFC 1321 of the IETF. However,  it is recommended  to use a safer algorithm  like SHA-2 for hashing  purposes,
because  several important  defects  were found.
MDS is frequently  used for saving  a password.  The result  of hashing  a password  with MDS is saved. Therefore,
a server operator  or a third party cannot know the original password  using the hash result value of the
password  only stored in the system. If the user correctly  inputs the password,  the same hash value is
returned,  confirming  that the password  is correct.
+ SHA (Secure  Hash Algorithm)
MD5, which was developed  from SHA, means  a set of interlinked  hash functions.  It was first designed  by the
National  Security  Agency  (NSA) in 1993,and  it was designated  as the national standard  in the U.S. It is also
called SHA-O to distinguish  the first function  from the functions  designed  later. SHA-1, a variant of SHA-O,
was announced  two years later. Subsequently,  four more variants  were released,  such as SHA-224,  SHA-256,
SHA-384,  and SHA-512.  These are called SHA-2 as a group. Currently,  SHA-3, which is completely  different
from SHA-1 and SHA-2, is under development,  and it was confirmed  as SHA-3 in 2012.
SHA-0 and SHA-1 have a hash value of 160 bits, and SHA-224/256/384/512  provide a hash value of
224/256/384/512  bits, respectively.  In addition,  it is recommended  to use a hash function  of SHA-256  or
higher for safety. On the other hand, an attack on SHA-2 has not yet been reported,  but there is a possibility
of an attack because  SHA-2 functions  use a method  similar  to that of SHA-1.
@® Supplementing  hash functions
Salt is an arbitrary  bit string that is added when  a hash function  generates  a hash value. Salting  is to generate
a hash value by adding  a bit string to the original message.  For example,  a hash value can be created by adding
salt “topcit”  to the password  “@Kr5792cc’.
as shown in [Figure 11].

value, even though  the attacker  finds the hash value of the password  “@Kr5792cc’.  In addition,  if different  salts
are used for each user, the hash values of the users who use the same password  are generated  differently,
which significantly  improves  the problem  of the possibility  of recognition.
The hash values of the salt and password  can be stored in the server database,  then, when the user logs in,
the input password  can be checked  by hashing  it. It is known that to make salt and digest difficult  to guess, all
passwords  should have their own salt, and the salt length should be 32 bytes or more.

+ Integrity  verification  method
Integrity  verification  methods  in servers or network  security,  are divided into the method of detecting  an
error that occurs  while transmitting  data, and the method  of preventing  unauthorized  modification,  as shown
in <Table 6>. A checksum  and cyclic redundancy  check (CRC) are used to test integrity  when an error occurs
during data transmission.  The checksum  method,  a type of duplicate  test, tests integrity  by adding data to
obtain a checksum,  converting  it into a certain bit value, then adding it to the message.
CRC is mainly used as a method of verifying  transmission  data errors in the communication  system, such
as the Internet.  A checksum  is calculated  at the sending  side, based on polynomials  that are easy to detect
and corrected  errors, and it is sent after adding it to the header. Then, the receiving  side verifies integrity  by
calculating  the checksum  again, based on the same polynomial  and comparing  it with the received  checksum.
