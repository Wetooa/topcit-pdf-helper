    *   Faithfully perform tasks and build team harmony.
    *   Be honest, aiming for efficient and valuable projects/teams.

01 Understanding  the Concept  of Professional  Ethics
A) Concept  of Professional  Ethics
© Definition  of Professional  Ethics
Professional  ethics refers to a code of conduct  that people with a job should follow in the process  of engaging  in the
job.
Many people in modern society engage in vocational  activities  while belonging  to a specific organization  called
the workplace,  not only attaining  self-realization  but also forming relationships  and interacting  with others while
participating  in the common  life of society. At this time, the norms and standards  that can be applied to individuals’
mindsets,  attitudes  and related behaviors  toward  jobs and work, and mutual relations  required  in a specific  setting  of
a job can be called professional  ethics.
In the normative  aspect, professional  ethics consists  of ethical norms that must be observed  among people in their
professional  life, norms made up of rules of common  behavior, and norms that limit harmful behaviors  that should not
be performed,  that is, unethical  behaviors.
The sub-elements  of professional  ethics are divided into work ethics and community  ethics.

@ Importance  of professional  ethics
Professional  ethics is necessary  for fulfilling  responsibilities  and duties as a professional  while realizing  one's self
based on moral values, and is a requirement  that must be met for cooperation  in a community  life pursuing  common
interests.
The reason professional  ethics is important  is that the vocational  activities  have a significant  influence  on the
order and development  of companies  and society  as a whole, beyond the individual  level. Like the saying, “Ethics
rather than profit makes a company  of 200 years,” ethics is an important  factor that ensures  reliability  and leads to
competitiveness  in economic  activities.
If the level of professional  ethics is low, individuals  will only prioritize  their own interests  and not be considerate
of others. In addition,  cooperation  and interaction  necessary  for professional  life may not be achieved  well, and
