## Learning Guide: Information Systems & Networking Essentials

This guide extracts key concepts, definitions, and important facts from the original text, organized for efficient learning.

---

### I. System Architecture: Size Calculation

#### 1. Hardware Size Calculation
*   **Purpose:** Determine the required resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) for an information system to meet performance and capacity demands.
*   **Procedure:** Involves analyzing workload, estimating peak usage, considering future growth, and applying formulas or benchmarks to each component.
*   **Methods:** Specific calculation techniques vary by hardware component (e.g., CPU utilization formulas, memory sizing based on application needs, I/O performance for storage).

---

### II. Fault Response Technology

#### 1. High Availability (HA)
*   **Concept:** Ensures continuous operation of a system by minimizing downtime, typically through redundancy. It aims for a high percentage of uptime (e.g., "five nines" = 99.999%).
*   **Configuration Types:**
    *   **Active-Passive:** One server runs, another is a standby, taking over if the active fails.
    *   **Active-Active:** Multiple servers run simultaneously, sharing the workload, with failover if one fails.

#### 2. Fault-Tolerant System
*   **Concept:** A system designed to continue operating without interruption even if one or more components fail. Achieved through redundant hardware and software that can instantly compensate for failures without any loss of service or data. (Differs from HA, which allows for a brief interruption during failover).

#### 3. Disaster Recovery System (DRS)
*   **Definition:** A set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.
*   **Disaster Recovery Goals:**
    *   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum tolerable amount of data loss, measured in time (e.g., 1 hour of data loss).
    *   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum tolerable amount of time a system can be down after a disaster (e.g., 4 hours to restore service).

---

### III. Cloud Computing Technology

#### 1. Definition of Cloud Computing
*   **Concept:** On-demand delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence) over the Internet ("the cloud") with pay-as-you-go pricing.
*   **Comparison with Other Technologies:**
    *   **Traditional IT:** Requires significant upfront investment, maintenance, and manual scaling.

#### 2. Cloud Computing Types

*   **Service Types:**
    *   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., VMs, storage, networks). Users manage OS, applications. (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).
    *   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. Users manage applications, data. (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku).
    *   **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. Users just use the software. (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce).

*   **Operation Forms:**
    *   **Public Cloud:** Services offered by third-party providers over the public internet. (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
    *   **Private Cloud:** Exclusive cloud infrastructure for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.
    *   **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
    *   **Community Cloud:** Shared infrastructure for specific communities with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance).

#### 3. Server Virtualization Technology

*   **Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor - VMM):** Software that creates and runs virtual machines.
*   **Hypervisor Types:**
    *   **Type 1 (Bare-Metal/Native):** Runs directly on the host hardware, managing resources and allocating them to VMs (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen).
    *   **Type 2 (Hosted):** Runs on top of a conventional operating system as an application (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox).
*   **Server Virtualization Methods:**
    *   **Full Virtualization:** Hardware is fully emulated; guest OS doesn't need modification.
    *   **Paravirtualization:** Guest OS is modified to communicate directly with the hypervisor for better performance.
    *   **OS-level Virtualization (Containerization):** Shares the host OS kernel, providing isolated user-space environments (containers) instead of full VMs (e.g., Docker).

#### 4. Storage and Network Virtualization Technologies
*   **Storage Virtualization:** Abstracting physical storage resources into a single pool that can be managed and allocated as needed, independent of the underlying hardware.
*   **Network Virtualization:** Abstracting network resources (e.g., switches, routers, firewalls) from underlying hardware, allowing network services to be provisioned and managed programmatically (e.g., Software-Defined Networking - SDN, Network Function Virtualization - NFV).

### V. Datalink Layer (OSI Layer 2)

#### 1. Concept of Datalink Layer
*   **Role:** Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, handling error correction from the physical layer, flow control, and defining the physical addressing scheme (MAC addresses).
*   **Key Function:** Divides data from the Network layer into frames and adds a header and trailer for reliable transmission over a physical link.

#### 2. Encapsulation of the Datalink Layer
*   **Process:** Takes packets from the Network layer, adds a **frame header** and a **frame trailer** (checksum, error detection code) to create a **frame**.
*   **Frame Header:** Contains source and destination MAC addresses, frame type.
*   **Frame Trailer:** Contains error detection codes (e.g., CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check) to ensure data integrity.

#### 3. Datalink Layer Configuration
*   **Sub-layers:**
    *   **Logical Link Control (LLC):** Manages communication between network layer protocols and the media access control (MAC) sub-layer. Provides multiplexing and flow control.
    *   **Media Access Control (MAC):** Controls how devices on the network gain access to the medium and permission to transmit data. Handles physical addressing (MAC address).

#### 4. MAC Address Search
*   **IP Address and MAC Address Conversion Protocol:**
    *   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** A protocol used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network.
*   **MAC Address Search Scenario:** When a device wants to send a packet to an IP address on the local network, it uses ARP to broadcast a request for the MAC address associated with that IP. The device with that IP replies with its MAC address.

#### 5. Techniques of Datalink Layer Error Detection and Correction
*   **Concept of Error Control:** Mechanisms to ensure that data transmitted over a network arrives without errors.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Error Detection:** Identifies if errors occurred during transmission (e.g., Parity Check, Checksum, CRC).
    *   **Error Correction:** Not only detects errors but also corrects them, often by retransmitting corrupted data or using error-correcting codes (e.g., Hamming Code).

#### 6. IEEE 802 Standard
*   **Concept:** A family of IEEE standards for local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs).
*   **Key Standards:**
    *   **IEEE 802.3:** Defines specifications for Ethernet, including physical and data link layers (wired networks).

### VI. Network Layer (OSI Layer 3)

#### 1. Network Layer Overview and Equipment
*   **What is a Network Layer?:** Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing packets across different networks (inter-networking).
*   **Functions:**
    *   Logical addressing (IPv4, IPv6).
    *   Routing of packets.
    *   Packet fragmentation and reassembly.
    *   Error handling.
*   **Internetworking Equipment:**
    *   **Router:** A network device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It directs traffic based on IP addresses using routing tables.
    *   **Switch (Layer 3 Switch):** Primarily a Layer 2 device, but Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions like a router, often at higher speeds within a local network.
    *   **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN):** A logical subdivision of a physical network, allowing devices to be grouped as if they were on the same network even if physically separated. Improves security and network management.

#### 2. Network Layer Encapsulation
*   **Process:** Takes segments from the Transport layer, adds an **IP header** to create a **packet**.
*   **IPv4 Header:** Contains source and destination IP addresses, Time-To-Live (TTL), protocol type, header checksum, etc.

#### 3. Packet Switching and Network Layer Protocol/Command
*   **Packet Switching:** A method of grouping data into packets that are transmitted independently over a network. Each packet may take a different route to its destination.
*   **Network Layer Protocols:**
    *   **IP (Internet Protocol):** The primary protocol for addressing and routing packets across networks.
    *   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used by network devices to send error messages and operational information (e.g., ping, traceroute).
    *   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** (Also seen in Datalink Layer context) Used by network layer to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.
    *   **RARP (Reverse ARP):** Used to resolve a MAC address to an IP address.
*   **Network Layer Commands:**
    *   **ping:** Tests reachability of a host on an IP network.
    *   **traceroute (tracert):** Displays the path and measures transit delays of packets across an IP network.
    *   **ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Unix/Linux):** Displays current TCP/IP network configuration.

#### 4. Network Service Quality (QoS)
*   **Quality of Service (QoS) Characteristics:** Parameters that define the performance of a network service.
    *   **Bandwidth:** The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.
    *   **Latency (Delay):** The time it takes for a data packet to travel from source to destination.
    *   **Jitter:** Variation in latency.
    *   **Packet Loss:** The percentage of packets that fail to reach their destination.
*   **Quality Implementation Techniques:**
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Controls the rate of data being sent, often to conform to a traffic contract.
    *   **Traffic Policing:** Discards or re-marks packets that exceed the configured rate.
    *   **Queuing:** Prioritizes certain types of traffic over others using different queues.

#### 5. Routing Protocol Algorithm and Type
*   **Routing Protocol:** A protocol that specifies how routers communicate with each other, exchanging information about network reachability to build routing tables.
*   **Routing Algorithm:** The logical process used by routers to determine the optimal path for data packets. (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path, Bellman-Ford algorithm).
*   **Routing Protocol Types:**
    *   **Distance-Vector Protocols:** Routers advertise their entire routing table to directly connected neighbors (e.g., RIP - Routing Information Protocol).
    *   **Link-State Protocols:** Routers build a "map" of the entire network and calculate the shortest path to each destination (e.g., OSPF - Open Shortest Path First, IS-IS).
    *   **Path-Vector Protocols:** Routers exchange information about the entire path to a destination (e.g., BGP - Border Gateway Protocol, used between Autonomous Systems on the internet).

#### 6. IPv4 Overview
*   **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) Address:** A 32-bit numerical label assigned to devices connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Expressed in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

#### 7. IPv4 Address Designation System and Subnetting
*   **IPv4 Expression:** Typically uses dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   **IPv4 Address Designation System (Classful Addressing - historical):**
    *   **Class A:** Large networks (first octet 1-126).
    *   **Class B:** Medium networks (first octet 128-191).
    *   **Class C:** Small networks (first octet 192-223).
    *   **Class D:** Multicast addresses.
    *   **Class E:** Experimental.
*   **Special IPv4 Addresses:**
    *   **Private IP Addresses:** Used within private networks, not routed on the internet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
    *   **Loopback Address (127.0.0.1):** Used to test local network software.
    *   **Broadcast Address:** Sends data to all devices on a network.
*   **Subnetting:** Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets) to improve efficiency, security, and address management. Achieved by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address to create a subnet ID.
*   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** A method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets more efficiently than classful addressing. Uses a variable-length subnet mask (e.g., /24, /16) to define network prefixes, replacing the rigid class system.
*   **Supernetting (Route Aggregation):** Combining multiple smaller networks (subnets) into a larger network using a single routing entry. Reduces the size of routing tables.
*   **IPv4 Address Allocation:** Managed globally by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) and regionally by RIRs (Regional Internet Registries) to ensure unique and efficient distribution.
