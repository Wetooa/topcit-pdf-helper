# Database Fundamentals: Concepts & Roles

## 1. Data Independence & The 3-Level Architecture

**What is Data Independence?**
*   **Definition:** The ability to change the database schema at one level without affecting the schema at higher levels. It's the opposite of data dependency.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Reduce maintenance costs, data complexity, and data duplication.
    *   Maintain independence between the user interface (screen) and the database.
    *   Allow continuous evolution of user requirements without breaking the system.

**ANSI-SPARC 3-Level Database Architecture:**
This architecture separates how users see data from how it's actually stored and managed. It has three distinct phases (or schemas):

1.  **External Phase (External Schema):**
    *   **Description:** Represents individual users' viewpoints or a personal database schema.
    *   **Characteristics:** Multiple external schemas can exist, each tailored to specific users or applications.
    *   **Focus:** User's personalized view of the data.

2.  **Conceptual Phase (Conceptual Schema):**
    *   **Description:** A single, integrated view of the *entire* organization's database.
    *   **Characteristics:** Describes all data needed by all application systems and users, including relationships between data. It integrates all users' perspectives.
    *   **Focus:** The logical structure of the *entire* database.

3.  **Internal Phase (Internal Schema):**
    *   **Description:** Defines the physical storage structure of the database.
    *   **Characteristics:** How data is actually stored on storage devices (e.g., file organization, indexing).
    *   **Focus:** Physical implementation details.

**Benefits of 3-Level Architecture:**
*   Maintains independence between different views.
*   Allows changes in one layer without affecting others.
*   Supports different Data Definition Languages (DDL) and Data Manipulation Languages (DML) for various schemas.

### Types of Data Independence

Based on the 3-level architecture, there are two main types:

1.  **Logical Data Independence:**
    *   **Definition:** The ability to change the **conceptual schema** without affecting the **external schemas** or **application programs**.
    *   **Characteristics:** Allows the integrated database structure to change while user views remain unaffected.

2.  **Physical Data Independence:**
    *   **Definition:** The ability to change the **internal schema** (physical storage) without affecting the **conceptual schema**, **external schemas**, or **application programs**.
    *   **Characteristics:** Allows the physical storage structure to change without impacting the logical view of the database.

### Mapping and Independence

**Mapping:** Acts as a "bridge" connecting independent concepts between different schema levels.

1.  **External/Conceptual Mapping (Logical Mapping):**
    *   **Connects:** External view to the conceptual view.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the correlation, ensuring that changes in the conceptual view don't automatically alter external view field types.

2.  **Conceptual/Internal Mapping (Physical Mapping):**
    *   **Connects:** Conceptual view to the stored physical database.
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the correlation, ensuring that if the physical storage structure changes, this mapping is updated to keep the conceptual schema consistent.

## 2. Key Database Roles: DBA & DA

### Database Administrator (DBA)

The DBA is responsible for the configuration and overall administration of the database system to ensure its proper function.

**Key Tasks and Roles:**

*   **Data Modeling:** Performs physical data modeling, semi-normalization, and performance modeling based on business and storage environment.
*   **Physical Database Design:** Designs indexes, storage space, clustering, and partitioning based on physical environment and DBMS.
*   **Tuning (Performance Improvement):** Optimizes performance using index distribution, join relationships, and transaction types.
*   **Database Building:** Creates table spaces, data file spaces, database objects, sets parameters, and specifies backup structures.
*   **Database Operation:** Monitors memory and performance regularly.
*   **Database Standardization:** Defines glossaries and domains; manages database/data standards.

### Data Architect (DA)

The DA establishes, models, and systemizes policies and standards for all data-related elements, including data, database, data standards, and data security.

**Key Roles:**

*   **Establish Data Management System:** Sets up systems for metadata, data distribution/integration, information lifecycle management (ILM), performance/capacity monitoring, log management, and failure management.
*   **Establish Data Standards:** Defines terms, domains, data dictionaries, and metadata standards to maintain data consistency.
*   **Data Modeling:** Oversees conceptual, logical, and physical modeling, which is crucial for the entire data architecture.
*   **Establish Data Security Systems:** Implements systems for user access control (tables, views), data encryption, access logs, and transaction traceability.

## 3. Database Management System (DBMS)

### Concept of DBMS

*   **Evolution:** Invented in the late 1960s to overcome limitations of file systems, such as data dependency and redundancy.
*   **Definition:** A software system that manages a database, acting as a mediator between application programs and data. It enables data sharing among all applications.

### Functions of a DBMS

*   **Data Duplication Control:** Minimizes redundancy in data storage and during development/maintenance.
*   **Data Sharing:** Allows multiple users and applications to access and share data concurrently.
*   **Access Control:** Regulates access to data by unauthorized users (security).
*   **Diverse Interfaces:** Provides various types of interfaces for different users (e.g., SQL, graphical tools).
*   **Relationship Expression:** Represents complex relationships between data entities.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures the accuracy, consistency, and validity of data within the database (e.g., through constraints).

### DBMS Components

A DBMS consists of several modules that work together to manage data:

*   **DDL Compiler:** Processes Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, storing schema information (metadata) in the system catalog. All other modules use this catalog.
*   **Query Processor:** Handles user queries: analyzes, parses, compiles them, then creates database access code for execution by the Runtime DB Handler.
*   **DML Pre-compiler:** Extracts Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands embedded in application programs and sends them to the DML Compiler.
*   **DML Compiler:** Parses and compiles DML commands, generating object code for database access.
*   **Runtime Database Handler:** Manages actual database access during execution, performing operations like searches or updates using the Stored Data Manager.
*   **Transaction Manager:** Ensures integrity constraints and user rights are upheld during database access. It also handles concurrent transaction control and database restoration in case of failures.
*   **Stored Data Manager:** Manages access to the user database and the system catalog stored on disk. It interacts with the operating system's file manager.

## 4. Understanding Types of Databases

### Recent Trends and Major Issues

*   **Early Days (late 1960s):** Databases emerged to manage data more efficiently than file systems.
*   **Evolution of Models:**
    *   Started with **Network Model**.
    *   Evolved into **Relational (RDB)** and **Object-Oriented (OODB)** models.
    *   Currently, the **Object Relational Database (ORDB)** model is widely used.
*   **Shift in Focus:**
    *   **Past:** Emphasis on internal data model and database structure.
    *   **Present:** Increased importance of **database processing performance** and **scalability** due to the rapid growth of large-scale digital data and performance degradation issues.
*   **Emerging Database Types:** To address new performance and scalability needs, new database types have emerged, such as:
    *   **Column-type databases:** Prioritize performance and scalability over traditional data relations.
    *   **NoSQL databases:** A broad category designed for specific data models and flexibility, often for massive, unstructured data.

[Figure  2] 3-level database  architecture
To understand  data independence,  it is helpful to understand  the background  to the introduction  of the concept
of data independence.  The opposite  of data independence  can be defined as data dependency.  Here, the subject
of dependency  generally  refers to an application  program.  An application  is the interface  object which interacts
with users and handles  the user requirements.  It can be said that data dependency  has the purpose  of reducing
continuously  increasing  maintenance  costs, data complexity,  and the number  of duplicated  data. The concept  of
data independence  was also introduced  to maintain  independence  between  the screen and the database  against  the
users’ constantly  evolving  requirements.
It can be said that data independence  is a three-schema  architecture,  which was proposed  by the special
subcommittee  of the X3 committee  under the American  Standards  Institute  (ANSI) for the DBMS and its interfaces,
The main purpose  of this three-schema  architecture  was to reduce interference  in changes,  by separating  the
user's view of the database  from the view by which the database  is actually  expressed.  When data independence  is
secured,  the independence  of each view can be maintained,  data can be changed  without  affecting  the view by layer,
and different  DDL (data definition  language)  and DML (data manipulation  language)  can be provided  according  to the
schema  by phase.
@ 3-level database  architecture  of ANSI-SPARC
The data independence  model, which is based on the 3-level database  architecture  proposed  by ANSI/SPARC,
presents  a model composed  of an external  phase, a conceptual  phase, and an internal  phase, none of which interferes
with the others.

@ Data independence  of two areas
As the concept  of data independence  can be separated  into these three phases, there are two terms that specify
the independence  of each area, namely  ‘logical independence’  and ‘physical independence’.

@ Relationship  between  mapping  and independence
The English  word “mapping”  can be translated  into “sasang”  in Korean,  which can be defined  as a “bridge  that connects
independent  concepts”.  Broadly  speaking,  there are two types of mapping  in data independence.
