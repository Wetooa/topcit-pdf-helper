## 5. Chapter Learning Objectives

By studying this chapter, you will be able to:

1.  Explain the concept of the Internet and open protocols.
2.  Explain how the OS manages processes.
3.  Explain the concept of virtual memory and its management techniques.
4.  Explain storage units, file systems, and input/output (I/O).
5.  Explain the latest OS technologies and trends.

## 6. Key Networking Concepts & Terms

*   **Protocols:** Sets of rules for communication.
*   **Internet:** Global system of interconnected computer networks.
*   **Standard Organizations:** IETF, 3GPP, 3GPP2, ITU-T (develop communication standards).
*   **OSI Reference Model:** A conceptual framework for understanding network communication, with 7 layers:
    *   Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Datalink, Physical.
*   **Internet Protocol (IP) Layer Model:** A simpler model (often TCP/IP model) with layers like:
    *   Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface.
*   **Network Addressing:**
    *   **MAC Address:** Hardware address unique to each network interface card.
    *   **IP Address:** Logical address used to identify devices on a network (IPv4, IPv6).
    *   **Port Number:** Identifies specific applications/services on a device.
*   **Networking Concepts:**
    *   **Private Network:** A network using private IP address ranges, not directly routable on the public Internet.
    *   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Translates private IP addresses to public ones, allowing private networks to access the Internet.
    *   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** A method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets more efficiently.
    *   **RFC (Request for Comments):** Documents that describe Internet standards and protocols.

## 7. Understanding Networks: A Web Use Scenario

Let's trace how a user accesses a webpage (`http://my.server.com/`) in detail:

1.  **User Action:** User A types `http://my.server.com/` into a web browser and presses Enter.
2.  **DNS Request (Domain Name Resolution):**
    *   The browser needs the IP address of `my.server.com` (domain names are user-friendly, but computers use IPs).
    *   The browser sends a request to a **DNS (Domain Name Server)** to get the corresponding IP address.
3.  **Connect to Webserver & HTTP Request:**
    *   The DNS server returns the webserver's IP address (e.g., `220.17.23.15`).
    *   The browser uses this IP address to connect to the webserver.
    *   It then sends an **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** request to fetch the homepage data.
4.  **TCP Protocol (Transport Layer):**
    *   The browser hands the request information to the **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.
    *   TCP encapsulates the information into segments, ensuring reliable delivery to the correct webserver program on `my.server.com`.
5.  **IP Protocol & Network Routing (Internet Layer):**
    *   The TCP segment is further encapsulated into an **IP (Internet Protocol)** packet.
    *   This IP packet is routed across the network towards the `220.17.23.0` network where `my.server.com` resides.
6.  **Local Network Transfer (Network Interface Layer):**
    *   **Private IP:** User A's computer (e.g., `192.168.11.5`) often uses a private IP address, which cannot be directly sent to a public IP like `220.17.23.15`.
    *   **Gateway:** The packet must first be sent to the local network's **gateway** (e.g., `192.168.11.1` - a wired/wireless router).
    *   **MAC Address:** Within the local network, IP addresses alone are not enough; **MAC addresses** are needed for direct device-to-device communication.
    *   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** The computer uses ARP to find the MAC address corresponding to the gateway's IP address (`192.168.11.1`) via network broadcasting.
    *   **Packet Transmission:** The packet is then transmitted to the gateway router B, involving **ARP, Ethernet, private networking, and NAT**.

that houses the CPU and the main memory.  The mainframe  features  excellent  stability  and performance,  but it is
very expensive  because  an enterprise  made all the elements  from the CPU to OS, the development  language,  and
the application  programs,  The mainframe  began downsizing  gradually  in 1997 when the attention  to super Unix
servers, such as HP, Sun, and Silicon Graphics,  increased.  Downsizing  refers to replacing  a mainframe  server with a
super Unix server, While Unix servers  were generally  equipped  with a Power CPU, it is worth noting  that more mid- to
large-sized  servers  began featuring  Pentium  CPU in the server market  in 1997. It was around  this time that Windows
NT servers, using Intel CPU, were on the sharp rise. Twenty  years later, in 2017, x86 servers,  featuring  Intel CPU, are
dominating  the Unix server  market. Currently,  the server  market is divided into x86 servers and non-x86  servers.
Although  the market  is divided  into two major server  types in terms of sales,x86  servers  account  for more than 70%
when comparing  the number  of server  units sold.
This server has a stack structure.  The computer  hardware,  consisting  of a CPU, main memory,  and auxiliary  memory
is at the bottom.  An OS that abstracts  computer  hardware  and provides  services  to software  is located above it.
On top of the OS, middleware,  such as a webserver,  WAS, and DBMS server to support  the flexibility  of convenient
expansion,  as well as the reduction  of application  programs  and independence  of computer  hardware,  is located.
Application  programs  provide  services  to users using this middleware.

While some argue that an abacus used in calculations  in ancient  times is the origin of computers,  the Turing Machine,
devised by the English mathematician  Allen Turing in 1936, is generally  regarded  as the beginning  of modern
computers.  This Turing Machine  proved the mathematical  concepts  and calculation  processes.  Afterward,  ENIAC,
created in 1946, is known as the first programmable  general-purpose  computer.  Using 18,000 vacuum tubes, it
weighed  30 tons and was literally as large as a house. Later, EDSAC,  the first computer  that embedded  the program

for military  purposes  in the past, the popularization  of computers  began in the 1980s when a PC, developed  by IBM,
and the Windows  operating  system,  developed  by MS, were successful. In recent  years, mobile computers  installed  in
smartphones  have become  popular  and opened  the era of handheld  computers.

>> Recent  trends and issues
In network  technology  have evolved  from data communication,  through existing  56kbps wired media, to
wireless networks  and mobile  communication  of hundreds  of Mbps and even Gbps. Moreover,  the advent
of various  connected  terminals  has led people to in an inseparable  relationship  with communication  in their
daily lives, as well as in more diverse  business  areas. Accordingly,  software  used in a terminal  or system has
a close relationship  with a network,  and it is based on mutual communication.  It is necessary  to understand
and utilize the standard  protocols  used by networks  to design and develop  organic  and optimized  software,
based on this network  concept.
