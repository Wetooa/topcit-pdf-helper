### 2. Importance & Overview of Database Security

#### A. Why Database Security Matters

*   **Critical Asset:** Databases store vast amounts of vital data (personal, corporate confidential).
*   **Prime Target:** They are key targets for attackers.
*   **Business Impact:**
    *   **Sustainable Management:** Prevents enormous economic loss and loss of customer trust from data leaks.
    *   **Regulatory Compliance:** Mandated by laws like the Personal Information Protection Act, Information Communication Network Act, and Electronic Financial Transaction Act.

#### B. Three Principles of Database Security (CIA Triad)

Database security aims to protect information in three key areas:

1.  **Confidentiality:**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access or leakage of information.
    *   **Implementation:** Database privilege management, Database encryption.
2.  **Integrity:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure only authorized persons can modify information; prevent unauthorized changes.
    *   **Implementation:** Database privilege management.
3.  **Availability:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure continuous and uninterrupted database services.
    *   **Implementation:** Database redundancy.

### 3. Database Security Threats & Countermeasures

#### A. Common Database Security Threats

1.  **Illegal Access:** Unauthorized external users gaining access (e.g., via SQL injection, web shell execution).
2.  **Vulnerable Identification & Authentication:** Obtaining legitimate user identities through brute-force attempts or social engineering.
3.  **Data Leakage:** Stealing unencrypted data or decrypting stolen encrypted data.
4.  **Misuse of Cryptographic Modules:** Decrypting data using unreliable cryptographic tools or incorrect modes.

#### B. Countermeasures

1.  **Access Controls:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow only authorized users to access the database and prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Examples:** Account management, MAC, DAC, RBAC.
2.  **Views (Virtual Tables):**
    *   **Purpose:** Limit user access to only a permitted subset of data within the database.
    *   **Example:** `CREATE VIEW` statements.
3.  **Encryption:**
    *   **Purpose:** Secure important data by encrypting it.
    *   **Methods:** Using one-way (hashing like SHA-256) or two-way (symmetric/asymmetric like SEED, AES) cipher algorithms.

---

### 4. Database Access Control

#### A. Access Control Policies

1.  **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):**
    *   **Principle:** Access determined by the subject (user) or group identity.
    *   **Key Feature:** The **object owner** (e.g., table owner) controls who gets access permissions.
    *   **Example:** A user who owns a table can grant or revoke privileges to other users.

2.  **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):**
    *   **Principle:** Access is controlled by the system based on security classifications (e.g., owner's rights to confidential objects).
    *   **Key Feature:** System-wide security policy dictates access, not the user.
    *   **Example:** Only a database administrator (DBA) with the highest clearance can access system catalogs.

3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   **Principle:** Access permissions are assigned to **roles**, and users are assigned to roles.
    *   **Key Feature:** Central administrator defines roles and their associated privileges. Access is based on a user's role in the organization.
    *   **Example:** Defining a 'DBA' role with specific privileges and assigning that role to appropriate personnel.

#### B. Methods for Controlling Database Access

1.  **Agent Method:**
    *   **How it works:** An **agent** (with access control and logging functions) is installed directly on the database server. Users access via a dedicated client.
    *   **Pros:** Can implement strong access control.
    *   **Cons:** Can cause **performance degradation** on the database server due to increased traffic/load.

2.  **Gateway Method (Proxy Method):**
    *   **How it works:** All database connection requests are routed through a central **database access control server (proxy server)**.
    *   **Pros:** Provides the most powerful access control. Supports redundancy for high availability (work is unaffected even if one proxy server fails).
    *   **Cons:** Introduces a proxy layer, which can be a single point of failure if not configured redundantly.

3.  **Network Sniffing Method:**
    *   **How it works:** Uses **TAP equipment** to analyze and log network packets directly.
    *   **Pros:** No need to install agents on servers or clients; no load added to the database server or network.
    *   **Cons:** Primarily an monitoring/auditing method; it is **not effective at fundamentally blocking damage to data integrity** caused by improper alterations, as it doesn't actively control access or changes.

>>b Subject
Managing  database  safely!
>>> Recent  trends and major issues
An amendment  to the Personal  Information  Protection  Act, which mandates  the encrypted  storage
of the resident  registration  number, passed the National  Assembly  plenary session on February
28, 2014. The content  of the amendment  is that the personal  information  handlers,  who keep the
resident  registration  number,  are obligated  to encrypt  the resident  registration  number  in order to
minimize  damage  if the personal  information  is leaked. Matters  concerning  the targets  of encryption
and application  timing of each target are determined  by Presidential  Decree, considering  the size
of the personal  information  processing  and the impact of leakage.  However,  its implementation  is
delayed, because  enormous  costs are required to encrypt  the social security  number, risk of failure,
and concern  about rapid performance  degradation  after encryption.  Recently,  there has been a spike
in interest  in database  encryption,  due to these trends and issues.
>>> Learning  objectives
To be able to explain database  security  requirements.
To be able to explain control elements  for database  security.
To be able to select a database  for encryption  and apply cryptographic  techniques.

Since the database  collects and stores a large amount  of data, from personal  information,  to
corporate  confidential  information,  it is an important  asset to protect  for an organization,  in addition
to being a key target for attackers.  Therefore,  database  access  control and encryption  policies  should
be established,  and countermeasures  should be prepared  to identify  various  security  threat elements
of the database  and safely protect  important  data from these security  threats.
Company  A decided  to come up with access control and encryption  measures  to safely manage
the database  and requested  consulting  by submitting  the following  requirements  to the consulting
company:
1) Company  A experiences  frequent  organization  and business  changes.  Therefore,  the company
needs a database  access  control system  that can be flexibly  applied  to such changes.
2) Company  A should encrypt  uniquely  identifiable  information,  within the period stipulated  by the
law, in accordance  with the revision  of the Personal  Information  Protection  Act.
3) Company  A should thoroughly  analyze  the impact  of encrypting  uniquely  identifiable  information  in
order to prevent  system failure and performance  degradation.

A) Overview  of database  security
@ Three  principles  of database  security
Database  security  means taking administrative,  physical,  and technical  protection  measures  in order to secure
confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  from the threat of leakage,  change, or destruction  of organizational
database  information.
In the past, the performance  of DB was emphasized,  but safe management  and data protection  is becoming
especially  important  in recent years, which proves that the value of data is increasing  with the advancement
of IT services.  Since the database  collects and stores a large amount  of data, from personal  information,  to
corporate  confidential  information,  it is an important  asset to protect  for an organization,  and a key target for
attackers.
<Table 27> Three principles  of database  security

@ Need for database  security
+ Database  security  for sustainable  management
Recently,  personal  information  leakage incidents  have occurred  in succession,  such as H capital, S portal, N
game company,  K telecom,  etc., which emphasize  the necessity  of database  security.  Database  security  is a
prerequisite  for sustainable  management  because  enormous  economic  loss, along with a decline in customer
trust, can threaten  the foundation  of a business,  if database  information  is leaked.
