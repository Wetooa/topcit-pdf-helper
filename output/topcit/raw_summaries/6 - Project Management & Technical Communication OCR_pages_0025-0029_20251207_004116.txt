## II. Creative Thinking Techniques

These techniques help generate innovative ideas and solutions through horizontal (divergent) thinking.

*   **Brainstorming**
    *   **Definition:** A meeting method (Alex Osborn, 1940s) for generating ideas freely. "Brainstorming" suggests a storm of ideas in the brain.
    *   **Purpose:** To produce many ideas without immediate evaluation.
    *   **Usage:** Applicable to all problem-solving stages (cause analysis, solution derivation, action plans).
    *   **Flow:** Free presentation of ideas before evaluation.

*   **Six Thinking Hats**
    *   **Definition:** A method by Edward de Bono where a group adopts different "hat" roles to approach an issue from various perspectives.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure comprehensive consideration and optimal decision-making.
    *   **Hat Roles:**
        *   **White:** Objective facts and data.
        *   **Red:** Emotions and feelings.
        *   **Black:** Negative, critical thinking (cautions).
        *   **Yellow:** Positive, optimistic thinking (benefits).
        *   **Green:** Creativity, new ideas.
        *   **Blue:** Organize results, objective moderation.

*   **Random Word**
    *   **Definition:** A technique by Edward de Bono that uses randomly chosen words to stimulate new connections and unique ideas.

*   **SCAMPER**
    *   **Definition:** An acronym checklist (Bob Eberle, derived from Osborn) for generating ideas.
    *   **Acronym:**
        *   **S**ubstitute: What can replace it?
        *   **C**ombine: What can be combined with it?
        *   **A**dapt: What can be adapted?
        *   **M**odify/Magnify: What can be changed or made bigger?
        *   **P**ut To Other Uses: How can it be used differently?
        *   **E**liminate: What can be removed?
        *   **R**earrange/Reverse: What can be reordered or done in reverse?
    *   **Purpose:** Systematically prompts different ways to alter or improve something.
    *   **Key Difference from Brainstorming:** Ideas are generated from a predefined list, not free association.

*   **TRIZ (Theory Of Inventive Problem Solving)**
    *   **Definition:** A problem-solving and ideation technique (Dr. Altshuller) based on analyzing thousands of inventions.
    *   **Purpose:** To model specific problems into generalized issues, find general solutions, and derive innovative solutions.

## III. Logical Thinking Techniques

These techniques focus on fact-based analysis and structured problem-solving through vertical (convergent) thinking.

*   **MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive)**
    *   **Definition:** A principle for organizing information or classifying problems so there is **no duplication** among items and **no omission** from the whole.
    *   **Mutually Exclusive:** Items do not overlap.
    *   **Collectively Exhaustive:** All possible items are included.
    *   **Example:** Dividing "time" into Past, Present, Future is MECE. Dividing "beverages" into ionized and carbonated is NOT MECE because other beverage types (e.g., mineral water) are omitted.

*   **The Logic Tree**
    *   **Definition:** A visual breakdown of key items in a tree format, adhering to the MECE principle.
    *   **Purpose:** Promotes logical thinking, generates comprehensive ideas, and acts as a checklist for strategy development and problem-solving by ensuring no omissions.
    *   **Example:** "Status Analysis" can be broken into "Business Environment" and "3C Analysis" (Company, Customer, Competitor), then further detailed.

*   **The 80-20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**
    *   **Definition:** Discovered by economist Pareto, it states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.
    *   **Meaning:**
        *   20% of customers generate 80% of sales.
        *   Solving the core 20% of problems can resolve 80% of all problems.
    *   **Application:** Concentrate resources on the essential 20% causal variables to solve the majority (80%+) of a problem.

## IV. Rational Decision-Making Techniques

These techniques focus on making efficient and effective decisions among multiple alternatives.

*   **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MADM)**
    *   **Definition:** A technique for selecting the best alternative by considering various factors or criteria, rather than just one.
    *   **Process:** Evaluate how well each alternative meets its characteristic attributes (factors) to inform the final decision.

*   **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**
    *   **Definition:** A technique that structures complex decision-making information into a hierarchical tree.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Segments complex and non-quantifiable problems.
        2.  Evaluates segmented problems through **pairwise comparisons** (comparing two elements at a time).
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies complex problems, making elements easier for decision-makers to compare and judge.

## V. Essential Problem-Solving Skills

These are common competencies for effective problem resolution, emphasizing continuous improvement.

*   **Problem Awareness:** Recognizing the gap between a desired ideal state and the current reality, and actively working to close that gap. This involves continuously striving to raise your "quality threshold."

*   **Key Factors to Enhance Problem Solving:**
    1.  **Always ask "why":** This is the core of problem recognition. You cannot solve a problem you don't acknowledge.
    2.  **Develop an active attitude:** Approach problems with positive thinking and the ability to transform ideas. Be open to linking seemingly unrelated concepts for new solutions.
    3.  **Take ownership of your problems:** See problems as your responsibility and strive to resolve them. Avoid blaming others to effectively solve issues and grow professionally.

ESSENCE
@ Step 1: Problem  Definition
In the problem definition  stage, you decide what problem you want to solve. It is necessary  to organize  the
problem  to grasp its essence,  and whether  the problem  can be fundamentally  resolved  by writing the problem
description.  For more accurate problem definition,  it is helpful to apply the MECE framework  to break the
problem  into subproblems,  rather  than defining  it as a single problem.
@ Step 2: Cause Analysis
In the stage of cause analysis,  a defined problem  is classified  according  to logical criteria and structured  step
by step. In order to analyze the cause of a structured  problem in detail, an issue tree is used to dissect  the
largest problem into smaller  components  in a logical order and organize  it in a tree form. From the bottom of
the organized  problem,  profiling  and various analysis  methods  are used to find the root cause of the problem.
In addition,  it is necessary  to prioritize  the finally identified  causes of the problem,  and remove  the ones that
are not essential  for fundamental  problem  solving.
© Step 3: Alternative  Development  and Evaluation
In the alternative  development  and evaluation  stage, various  alternatives  are developed  to address  the cause
of the problem  finally derived in the cause analysis  stage. Alternatives  developed  by establishing  various
hypotheses  from the root cause of the problem and comparing  with the facts found through profiling  are
evaluated  through  evaluation  criteria and weighting  for each criterion,  and one or more alternatives  are finally
selected.
@ Step 4: Solution  Application  and Feedback
In the solution  application  and feedback  stage, the final selected  alternative  is verified.  It is important  to find a
test bed to verify the established  alternative  the most efficiently,  and prepare  for its execution.  The alternative
is executed  based on a detailed  workplan  and quantitative  feedback  on its effectiveness  is provided,  to verify
the validity  of the alternative  and provide  feedback.
C) Creative  thinking  techniques
It is important  to clearly define everyday  problems  found in the course of job performance  and to derive solu-
tions or processes  to address  them through  various ideas. To this end, it is necessary  to consciously  guide
the flow of thinking  through  appropriate  techniques.  There are the following  ways of thinking  techniques  that
creatively  solve problems  through  this horizontal  process.
@ Brainstorming
In the 1940s, American  advertiser  Alex Osborn invented  brainstorming  as a kind of meeting  method  to come
up with ideas. The original meaning  of the term brainstorming  refers to the mental derangement  of a mentally
ill patient. In other words, abnormal  phenomena,  like a storm in the brain, are used as a way of thinking of
ideas at meetings.  It can be used in the entire process  of problem  solving, such as analyzing  the cause of the
problem,  deriving  a solution, developing  evaluation  criteria and establishing  an action plan.

@ Six Thinking  Hats
The Six Thinking  Hats is a simple yet effective  way to think, developed  by Edward  de Bono. In other words, it
is a method  of a group of six people taking different  roles and present  ideas that fit their roles, to approach  an
issue from various  perspectives  and derive the optimal  decision-making.
<Table 3> Composition  of Six Thinking  Hats
Type of Hat Role
White The role of Explain objective  facts or data in a neutral manner
Red Emotional  thinking
Black Negative  or critical thinking
Yellow Positive and optimistic  thinking
Green Be creative  and generate  new ideas
Blue Organize  results in a cool-headed  and objective  manner
@ Random  Word
Random  Word is a thinking  technique  devised  by Professor  Edward de Bono. Various  words are presented  until a unique
idea comes  out, and words are selected  and combined  at random  to create new connections.
@ SCAMPER
SCAMPER  is an analysis  method derived from the checklist  of Osborn, the originator  of ideation  method
brainstorming,  and revised by Bob Eberle. The term SCAMPER  is an acronym  formed from the abbreviation
of: “Substitute”,  “Combine”,  “Adapt”, “Modify”  or “Magnify”,  “Put To Other Uses’, “Eliminate”,  “Rearrange”  or
“Reverse”. It is an ideation  method similar to brainstorming  that draws out ideas at random, but it differs in
that ideas are generated  from a list prepared  in advance.
