## Project Risk Management Learning Guide

This guide covers the core concepts and processes of project risk management.

### Key Definitions

*   **Contingency:** A financial or time reserve calculated to address potential risks. It can be based on:
    *   The expected value of a risk's probability and impact.
    *   A percentage of the total project budget.
*   **Countermeasure:** A specific action or plan established and executed on an ad-hoc basis to respond to a identified risk.

### The Risk Management Process

Risk management involves four main stages:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Recognizing and documenting potential risks.
2.  **Risk Analysis/Evaluation:** Assessing the probability and impact of identified risks.
3.  **Risk Response:** Developing and planning actions to address risks.
4.  **Risk Control:** Monitoring risks, implementing responses, and evaluating effectiveness.

---

### 1. Risk Identification

**Goal:** To find and document all potential risks that could affect the project as early as possible.

**Key Point:** Prioritize reviewing contractual obligations, proposals, and project execution plans. Any omission in the plan that is specified in the contract can lead to acceptance criteria violations.

**Methods for Risk Identification:**

*   **Documentation Reviews:** Examine project plans, assumptions, previous project files, contracts, and other project documents.
*   **Information Gathering Techniques:**
    *   **Brainstorming:** Group idea generation.
    *   **Delphi Technique:** Expert opinions gathered anonymously to reach a consensus.
    *   **Interviews:** Discussions with project stakeholders and experts.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the underlying reasons for potential problems.
*   **Checklist Analysis:** Using pre-existing lists from similar projects or knowledge bases. A Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) can serve as a checklist.
*   **Assumption Analysis:** Reviewing project assumptions to identify inaccuracies, instability, inconsistencies, or incompleteness.
*   **Diagramming Techniques:** Visual tools to identify relationships and potential risks:
    *   **Cause and Effect Diagrams (Fishbone):** Identify potential causes for a specific effect.
    *   **System or Process Flow Diagrams:** Illustrate how system elements interact.
    *   **Interrelationship Diagrams:** Show relationships between various factors.
*   **SWOT Analysis:** Investigating project Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to broaden the scope of identified risks (including internal risks).
*   **Expert Judgment:** Direct identification of risks by experts with relevant project or business experience.

**Output: The Risk Register**

*   A document used to record, track, and manage identified risks.
*   It typically includes:
    *   **ID:** Unique identifier for the risk.
    *   **Risk Item:** Description of the risk.
    *   **Probability:** Likelihood of occurrence.
    *   **Impact:** Severity of the effect.
    *   **Exposure:** Calculated risk level (e.g., Probability x Impact).
    *   **Priority:** Rank of the risk.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Planned response action.
    *   **Manager:** Person responsible for the risk.
*   The Risk Register is updated throughout the project with analysis results and control information.

### 2. Risk Analysis

This stage assesses identified risks to prioritize them for response planning.

#### A) Qualitative Risk Analysis

**Goal:** To prioritize risks by qualitatively evaluating their probability of occurrence and potential impact on project objectives.

**Technique: Probability-Impact Matrix**

*   A matrix that plots risks based on their qualitative probability and impact ratings.
*   **Risk Level Calculation:** Risk Level = Probability of Occurrence (P) × Degree of Impact (I).
*   **Rating Scales (Examples):**
    *   **Probability:** Very Low (0.1) to Very High (0.9).
    *   **Impact:** Very Low (0.1) to Very High (0.8) on project objectives.
*   Risks are then ranked (e.g., Low, Moderate, High) to help prioritize response planning.

#### B) Quantitative Risk Analysis

**Goal:** To numerically estimate the overall effect of prioritized risks on project objectives (e.g., cost, schedule). This typically follows qualitative analysis.

**Methods for Quantitative Risk Analysis:**

*   **Interviews:** Experts quantify probability and impact based on experience and precedents.
*   **Probability Distributions:** Used in modeling to measure the uncertainty of values like activity durations or cost components.
*   **Tornado Diagrams:** Show how sensitive project outcomes are to changes in individual risk factors. Results are displayed as a bar graph, ordered by sensitivity.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Describes hypothetical future situations based on assumptions, then analyzes the impact of each assumption on project results.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
    *   Repeatedly substitutes a range of random values for parameters in a probability model.
    *   Generates a cumulative distribution of possible outcomes to predict a specific variable.
    *   Provides a probabilistic model by analyzing these cumulative results.
*   **Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis:**
    *   Calculates the expected financial outcome by considering risks.
    *   Requires a "risk-neutral" assumption (neither avoiding nor seeking risk).
    *   Multiplies each possible outcome by its probability and sums these values.
    *   Often used in conjunction with decision tree analysis.

### 3. Risk Response

**Goal:** To develop and implement actions that reduce negative threats and enhance positive opportunities for project objectives.

**Strategies for Negative Risks (Threats):** These aim to minimize negative impacts.

*   **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk completely by changing the project plan, scope, or strategy. Examples: extending schedule, altering strategy, reducing scope.
*   **Transfer:** Shift the impact and responsibility of the risk to a third party. This doesn't eliminate the risk, but shifts who handles it. Effective for financial risks. Tools include insurance, performance bonds, warranties, and guarantees.
*   **Mitigate:** Reduce the probability of the risk occurring or its impact to an acceptable level. Examples: early preventive measures, extensive testing, selecting simpler processes.
*   **Acceptance:** Adopted when eliminating the risk isn't possible.
    *   **Passive Acceptance:** No active steps are taken other than documenting the risk. The project team deals with the risk if it occurs.
    *   **Active Acceptance:** Proactively building contingency reserves (time, capital, resources) to deal with the risk if it occurs.

**Strategies for Positive Risks (Opportunities):** These aim to maximize positive impacts.

*   **Exploit:** Take actions to ensure the opportunity happens and its benefits are realized. Examples: dedicating skilled resources, reducing costs to make an opportunity more viable.
*   **Share:** Partner with other organizations or teams to realize an opportunity, sharing the benefits and risks. Examples: forming partnerships.
*   **Enhance:** Increase the probability or impact of an opportunity. Identifies main causes and takes actions to maximize effectiveness.
*   **Acceptance:** Choose to take advantage of an opportunity if it arises, but without actively pursuing it.

---

### 4. Risk Control

**Goal:** To implement the risk response plan, track identified risks, monitor new and residual risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management activities.

**Methods for Risk Control:**

*   **Risk Reassessment:** Regularly perform activities to:
    *   Identify new risks that emerge.
    *   Reassess the status and impact of current risks.
    *   Terminate risks that are no longer relevant or have passed.
*   **Risk Audits:** Investigate and document:
    *   The effectiveness of chosen risk countermeasures.
    *   The effectiveness of the overall risk management process.
*   **Variance and Trend Analysis:**
    *   Compare planned project outputs with actual outputs.
    *   Review trends in project execution using performance information to identify potential issues or successes.
*   **Technical Performance Measurement:**
    *   Compare the project's technical performance against the technical performance schedule in the project plan.
    *   Measures can include weight, number of transactions, defective deliveries, storage capacity, etc.

---

### Recent Trends in Project Evaluation

*   **Past Criteria:** Project success was measured by completion on schedule, within budget, and meeting original objectives.
*   **Current Criteria:** Project success is now increasingly measured by its quantitative and qualitative contribution to:
    *   Achieving the company's management goals.
    *   Improving the company's competitiveness.

### Project Evaluation Overview

*   **Evaluation Stages:**
    *   **Ex-ante Evaluation:** Conducted before the project starts.
    *   **Interim Evaluation:** Conducted during the project's execution.
    *   **Ex-post Evaluation:** Conducted after the project is completed.
*   **Evaluation Types:**
    *   IT Investment Performance Management.
    *   General Performance Evaluation.

[Figure  44] Risk Management  Process
A) Risk identification
It is important  to find the risks in the right time as possible.  Risk identification  involves  identifying  and docu-
menting  risks that may affect the project. A commonly  used risk identification  method is documentation  re-
view. The scope and schedule  of tasks specified  in the contract  are legally valid and should be prioritized.  The
contract,  proposal,  and project  execution  plan should be cross-checked  and double-checked  for any omission.
If something  omitted  from the project  execution  plan is specified  in the contract  or proposal,  even if it is not
actually  implemented,  it violates  the acceptance  criteria.

Expert  Judgment Activities  in which experts  with similar project  or business  experience  directly  identify  risks
Risk, which is a key output of risk identification,  is described  as initially identified  in the Risk Register.  The
identified  risks are registered  in the risk register,  and qualitative/quantitative  analysis  is performed  to prioritize
the risks for risk response  planning.  The results of these activities  are recorded  in the risk register  so that
risks can be systematically  tracked/managed.

B) Risk analysis:  qualitative  risk analysis
Qualitative  risk analysis means qualitatively  analyzing  how much impact the risk has on the project at the
beginning.  Qualitative  risk analysis  refers to a method of prioritizing  risks by evaluating  the probability  and
impact  of risks after risk identification  is complete.  Probability-Impact  Matrix is a technique  that qualitatively
evaluates  the probability  of a risk and its impact  on the objective  and analyzes  it in a matrix form.

Impact
| | Low [| | Moderate aa High
[Figure  45] Probability-Impact  Matrix (Example)
The risk level is “F(probability,  impact)  = probability  of occurrence  (P) X degree of impact  (I)’.
The probability  of occurrence  ranges from very low (0.1) to very high (0.9).
The impact  on the objective  ranges  from very low (0.1) to very high (0.8).
The risk level is calculated  by “probability  of occurrence  X impact” and the ratings are ranked as low, moder-
ate, and high for risk prioritization.
