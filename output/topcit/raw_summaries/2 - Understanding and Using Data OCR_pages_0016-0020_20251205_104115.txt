## Database Management Learning Guide

### 03 Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other regarding data visibility and consistency.

*   **Read Uncommitted:** Allows a transaction to read data that another transaction has modified but not yet committed. (Lowest isolation, highest concurrency, prone to dirty reads).
*   **Read Committed:** Allows a transaction to read data only after another transaction has committed its changes. (Prevents dirty reads).
*   **Repeatable Read:** Ensures that if a query is executed multiple times within the same transaction, it will return the same set of records and values. (Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads). New records (phantoms) can still appear.
*   **Serializable Read:** The highest isolation level. Ensures that if a query is executed multiple times within the same transaction, it returns the exact same result set, including no new records appearing. (Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads). (Lowest concurrency).

### 04 Deadlock

*   **Definition:** A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release resources, leading to a standstill.
*   **Causes:** Occurs when transactions simultaneously try to acquire locks on resources already held by another transaction, creating a circular wait condition.
*   **Solutions:**
    *   **Detection and Recovery:** Allow deadlocks to occur, detect them, and then resolve by rolling back one or more transactions.
    *   **Prevention:** Design transactions to prevent deadlocks (e.g., acquire all necessary locks at once, enforce a locking order).
    *   **Avoidance:** Dynamically analyze resource requests to ensure a safe state before granting locks.

### XII. Database Recovery

#### 01 Concept of Database Failure and Recovery

*   **Definition of Data Recovery:** The process of restoring a database to a consistent and correct state after a failure.
*   **Types of Database Failures:**
    *   Transaction failures (e.g., logical errors, deadlocks).
    *   System crashes (e.g., power failure, software error).
    *   Media failures (e.g., disk crash, head crash).
    *   Human errors (e.g., accidental deletion).
*   **Basic Principles of Database Recovery:**
    *   **Principle of Information Redundancy:** Maintaining redundant information (like logs, backups) to restore lost data.
*   **Types of Database Recovery Actions:**
    *   **Undo:** Removing the effects of uncommitted transactions.
    *   **Redo:** Reapplying the effects of committed transactions.

#### 02 Database Troubleshooting Method

*   **Database Recovery Technique:** Using transaction logs (redo/undo logs) and checkpoints to restore the database state.
*   **Recovering from a Distributed Database:** Often uses a **2-phase commit protocol** to ensure all nodes in a distributed transaction either commit or abort together, maintaining consistency.

#### 03 Database Backup

*   **Database Backup Overview:** Creating copies of database data to protect against data loss.
*   **Database Backup Requirements & Main Tasks:**
    *   Ensure data integrity.
    *   Minimize downtime during backup and recovery.
    *   Allow point-in-time recovery.
    *   Tasks include scheduling, execution, storage, and validation of backups.
*   **Types and Characteristics of Database Backup Methods:**
    *   **Full Backup:** Copies all data. (Simple, takes longest, fastest recovery).
    *   **Differential Backup:** Copies all changes since the last *full* backup. (Faster than full, slower recovery than incremental as it grows over time).
    *   **Incremental Backup:** Copies all changes since the *last* backup (full or incremental). (Fastest backup, slowest recovery as multiple backups may be needed).
    *   **Transaction Log Backup:** Copies transaction log entries, enabling point-in-time recovery.

### XIII. Understanding Database Analytics

#### 01 Concept and Characteristics of the Data Warehouse (DW)

*   **Concept of the Data Warehouse:** A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data used to support management's decision-making process.
*   **Characteristics of the Data Warehouse:**
    *   **Subject-Oriented:** Focused on specific business subjects (e.g., sales, customers) rather than day-to-day operations.
    *   **Integrated:** Combines data from various disparate sources into a consistent format.
    *   **Time-Variant:** Data includes a time dimension, allowing for historical analysis.
    *   **Non-Volatile:** Data is stable; new data is added but existing data is not updated or deleted.

#### 02 Data Warehouse Modeling

*   **Definition of Data Warehouse Modeling:** Designing the structure of a data warehouse to optimize for analytical queries.
*   **Data Warehouse Modeling Technique:**
    *   **Star Schema:** A common model where a central **fact table** connects to multiple **dimension tables**.
    *   **Snowflake Schema:** An extension of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.

#### 03 Concept of ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading)

*   **ETL:** A process used to prepare data for a data warehouse:
    *   **Extraction:** Reading data from source systems.
    *   **Transformation:** Cleaning, combining, and reformatting data into the data warehouse's structure.
    *   **Loading:** Writing the transformed data into the data warehouse.

#### 04 Concept and Search Technique of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

*   **Concept of OLAP:** A technology that allows users to quickly analyze multi-dimensional data from various perspectives.
*   **OLAP Search Techniques:**
    *   **Slice and Dice:** Reducing the dimensionality of a data cube (slice) or selecting a subset of data (dice).
    *   **Drill Down/Up:** Navigating from summarized data to detailed data (drill down) or vice-versa (drill up).
    *   **Roll Up:** Aggregating data along a dimension (e.g., summing sales by month instead of day).
    *   **Pivot (Rotate):** Changing the dimensional orientation of a report or view.

#### 05 Concept and Algorithm of Data Mining

*   **Concept of Data Mining:** The process of discovering patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets using various computational techniques.
*   **Data Mining Algorithms:** (Specific algorithms not detailed in text, but common types include):
    *   Classification (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines).
    *   Clustering (e.g., k-means).

    *   **Characteristics:** High scalability, high availability, flexible schema, often optimized for specific data models and workloads.
*   **BASE Attributes of NoSQL:**
    *   **Basically Available:** The system continues to operate even with some node failures.
    *   **Soft State:** The state of the system may change over time, even without input.
    *   **Eventually Consistent:** Data will eventually become consistent across all nodes, but there might be a delay. (Contrast with ACID properties of traditional RDBMS).
*   **Storage Method of NoSQL:** Varies greatly by type (e.g., key-value pairs, documents, columns, graphs).
*   **Characteristics of the NoSQL Data Model:**
    *   **Key-Value:** Simple, stores data as a collection of key-value pairs.
