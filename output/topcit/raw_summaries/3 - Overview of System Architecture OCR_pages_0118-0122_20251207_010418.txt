## **System Architecture & Sizing Learning Guide**

### **1. System Architecture Overview**

#### **A. Hardware Sizing Targets**
Capacity calculations focus on **servers** (not PCs/peripherals).
The four most important hardware areas for system price and performance are:
*   **CPU**: Calculates processing power for tasks, selects server model.
*   **Memory**: Calculates usage by system software and applications, based on CPU size and server configuration.
*   **Disk**: Calculates usage by OS, system software, database, and database backups, based on CPU size and server configuration.
*   **Storage**: Calculates overall storage needed, based on server size and CPU.

**Key Components by System Type:**
| Component    | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) | Web/WAS (Web/Web Application Server) |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| CPU          | Applicable                         | Applicable                           |
| Memory       | Applicable                         | Applicable                           |
| Disk System  | Applicable                         | Applicable                           |
| Data         | Applicable                         | Not directly applicable              |
| Storage      | Applicable                         | Applicable                           |

#### **B. Performance Standards**
Performance is measured for CPU and Storage using industry standards:

| Component | Subject/Layer             | Performance Measurement | Reference Standard |
| :-------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------- |
| **CPU**   | OLTP or OLTP & Batch      | tpmC                    | TPC-C              |
|           | Application Server        | ops                     | SPECjbb2005        |
|           | Webserver WAS             | ops                     | SPECWeb2009        |
| **Storage** | (General Storage Performance) | IOPS                    | SPC-1              |

#### **C. 3-Tier Architecture Model**
Most modern information systems adopt a **3-tier architecture**. Each tier has specific functions:
*   **Presentation Layer**:
    *   Collects user input.
    *   Provides a standard interface.
    *   Accesses business services.
*   **Business Logic Layer**:
    *   Contains data processing rules.
    *   Defines application business logic.
    *   Maps business functions to actions on business objects.
*   **Data Service Layer**:
    *   Handles data storage.
    *   Prevents data mismatch errors.
    *   Accesses the main database.

#### **D. Physical Server Configuration Models (Government Standard)**
These models dictate how the 3-tier architecture is physically deployed across servers for size calculation.
*   **Reference Model 1 (Single Server)**:
    *   All layers (Web / Application / Database) run on a **single server**.
    *   *Configuration:* WEB / WAS / DB server.
*   **Reference Model 2 (Two Servers)**:
    *   Layers are distributed across **two servers**.
    *   *Common Configurations:*
        1.  Server 1: Web & Application layers. Server 2: Database layer.
        2.  Server 1: Web layer. Server 2: Application & Database layers.
*   **Reference Model 3 (Three Servers)**:
    *   Each layer runs on a **separate server**.
    *   *Configuration:* Server 1: Web layer. Server 2: Application layer. Server 3: Database layer.

### **2. Size Calculation Procedure**

A 4-step process to determine hardware capacity:

#### **Step 1: System Implementation Direction & Basic Data Survey**
*   **Goal**: Ensure accurate hardware capacity calculation.
*   **Action**: Gather basic data about the tasks and the system to be implemented.
*   **Key**: Close cooperation with users to establish task analysis and implementation direction.

#### **Step 2: Basic Data & Task Analysis**
*   **Action**: Analyze new workloads, task relevance, complexity, and expected load for each task.
*   **Calculation**: Sum expected loads for all tasks to determine the "reference load."
*   **Validation**: Verify the accuracy of basic data and task analysis results.

#### **Step 3: Reference Model Determination & Server Sizing**
*   **Select Reference Model**: Choose the appropriate model (1, 2, or 3) based on the target system's architecture type.
    *   **Model 1 (Single Server)**: Server 1 handles OLTP.
    *   **Model 2 (Two Servers)**: Server 1 handles Web/WAS, Server 2 handles OLTP.
    *   **Model 3 (Three Servers)**: Server 1 handles Web/WAS, Server 2 handles Web/WAS, Server 3 handles OLTP.
*   **Apply Correction Coefficients**: Adjust calculations based on task analysis data.
*   **Calculate Component Sizes**: Determine CPU, memory, disk, and storage sizes for each server within the chosen reference model.

#### **Step 4: Weight Factor Application**
*   **Action**: After calculating the capacity of each server component (from Step 3), apply specific "weight factors" based on the architecture type.

#### **E. Hardware Component Sizing Method**
*   The overall process is to first determine the server configuration based on the chosen architecture type (e.g., Model 1, 2, or 3).
*   Then, calculate the CPU, memory, disk, and storage sizes for each individual server in that configuration.
*   (Detailed calculation methods are often found in specific guidelines like "TTA Guidelines on Calculating Information System Hardware").

### **3. Information System Infrastructure Trends**

#### **A. Traditional IT Infrastructure**
*   **Setup**: Servers, storage, network devices, and software are purchased separately from different vendors.
*   **Integration**: Components are configured and integrated on-site by resellers or IT staff.
*   **Maintenance**: Support and maintenance are provided by each individual supplier.
*   **Issues**: Leads to inefficiency due to complex setup, long implementation times, and challenging system management.

#### **B. Converged Infrastructure (CI)**
*   **Concept**: An approach to solve traditional IT infrastructure issues by integrating hardware (storage, server, network) with virtualization and management software into a single, pre-validated product.
*   **Features**:
    *   Hardware (servers, storage, networking) and software supplied as a single SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).
    *   Integrated at the factory by the manufacturer or reseller.
    *   Configured on customer site (for some solutions).
    *   Offers integrated operation and management, often based on software-defined technology.
*   **Advantages**: Quicker service implementation due to pre-integration and validation.
*   **Limitations**:
    *   Poor performance relative to input resources.
    *   High cost, especially due to expensive external storage.
    *   Scalability issues.

#### **C. Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)**
*   **Concept**: Overcomes the limitations of CI by eliminating expensive external storage.
*   **How it Works**:
    *   Uses **Direct-Attached Storage (DAS)** – disks directly connected to standard x86 servers.
    *   Groups these DAS resources across multiple servers into a shared **storage pool** using **Software-Defined Storage (SDS)** technology over an IP network. This pool functions similarly to a Storage Area Network (SAN).
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Eliminates structural complexity.
    *   Significantly reduces costs by removing the need for external storage.

Overview  of System Architecture )
the size calculation  target in the capacity  calculation  guidelines  is hardware,  which is defined as servers, not PCs
or other peripherals.  While there are several hardware  configuration  areas, the four areas - CPU, memory,  disk, and
storage  - are the most important  in terms of system  price and performance,  and they are defined by sizing areas.
+ CPU: Calculates  the CPU size to process  the necessary  tasks and selects  the server model that shows adequate
performance.
+ Memory:  Calculate  memory  usage by the system software  and applications  programs  for each server, based on the
server configuration,  according  to the CPU size.
+ Disk: Calculates  disk usage by the OS, system software,  database,  and database  archive/backup  for each server,
based on the server configuration,  according  to the CPU size.
+ Storage:  Calculates  the size of the needed  storage,  based on the server size, according  to the CPU.

C) Reference  architecture  for size calculation
Since the size is calculated  for each server, the person who calculates  the size needs to understand  the conceptual
model of the overall system architecture  that is to be implemented.  Most information  systems  nowadays  have
adopted  the 3-tier architecture,  as shown in [Figure  85].
