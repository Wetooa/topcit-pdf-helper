# IT Business and Ethics: Learning Guide (Pages 100-104)

## 1. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

**What is DSS?**
*   A system focused on improving the **effectiveness** of decision-making, aiming for optimal solutions.
*   Helps solve complex problems by providing financial/statistical models, simulations, and analytical tools.

**DSS Configuration & Components:**

A DSS is made up of interactive systems:
1.  **Database Management System:**
    *   Stores core corporate data (financial, accounting, marketing, production, HR).
    *   This data serves as the foundation for decision-making.
2.  **Model Base Management System:**
    *   An analytical tool designed to consistently solve similar problems.
    *   Uses quantified models (statistical, forecasting, linear planning, simulation) to increase problem-solving efficiency and accuracy.
3.  **Knowledge Base System:**
    *   Provides qualitative information to support solving unstructured decision problems that are difficult to quantify.
4.  **User Interface Management System:**
    *   The communication window between the decision-maker and the DSS.
    *   Ensures flexibility, performance, and user convenience.

**How DSS Works:**
*   Users access the knowledge system through the user interface to get information for decisions.
*   Users also access the model and database systems for management tasks.

**DSS Data Models:**
*   Provide a framework for data analysis, helping decision-makers make rational choices.
*   Continuously developed and improved, with increasing use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for better forecasting.

**Types of DSS Data Models:**
*   **What-if Analysis:** Examines how changes in one variable impact another (e.g., "What if sales increase by 10%?"). Useful for testing assumptions.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Observes how changes to one or two variables affect other variables within an equation model.
*   **Goal-seeking:** Determines the variable values needed to achieve a specific goal (e.g., "What sales volume do we need to hit a profit target?").
*   **Optimization Analysis:** Finds the best (optimal) value for one or more target variables given certain constraints.

## 2. Business Intelligence (BI)

**What is BI?**
*   A set of processes that improve business decisions and performance by summarizing, analyzing, and using enterprise data and information.
*   Evolved from DSS, extending decision support to regular employees, not just top decision-makers.
*   **Intelligence:** The ability to understand relationships between facts to achieve desired goals (Hans Luhn, IBM, 1958).

**BI Configuration & Key Operations:**
BI systems collect, analyze, and visualize data, organically linked to decision support.

1.  **ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Load):**
    *   Processes data from various sources (databases, applications, web services).
    *   Ensures consistency and compatibility, especially for **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** data.
2.  **Data Storage:**
    *   **Data Warehouse:** Centralized repository for integrated data.
    *   **Data Mart:** Smaller, focused data store for specific business functions or departments, allowing multi-dimensional analysis.
3.  **Analysis Tools:**
    *   Perform various analyses (e.g., **OLAP - Online Analytical Processing** for multidimensional expert analysis).
4.  **Visualization:**
    *   **Dashboards:** Key BI component, providing visual presentations of key metrics (charts, simulations, statistical analysis) for quick insights.

**Benefits of BI:**
*   **Decision Makers:** Get visual analyses of key management metrics.
*   **Field Managers:** Use multidimensional analytical tools (OLAP) for expert-level insights.

**Types of BI:**

| Classification   | Main Business Focus                   | Key Users                 | Measurement Target                                        | Frequency                  | Types of Data           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Strategy BI**  | Realizing long-term goals and targets | CEO, decision-makers      | Tracking feedback on strategic plans                      | Monthly, quarterly, annually | Past data, forecast data |
| **Analysis BI**  | Analyzing info/data for corporate goals | Task supervisor, analyst  | Tracking and analyzing feedback on strategy execution     | Daily, weekly, monthly     | Past data, forecast data |
| **Operations BI** | Managing daily business operations    | Task specialist, operator | Personalized BI for supervisors for performance insights | On the spot, any time      | Present/working hours   |

**BI Dashboard:**
*   A crucial data visualization tool for intuitive decision-making.
*   Displays the status of key quantified metrics and performance indicators (e.g., sales, costs, profits, risks) on a single screen.
*   Helps decision-makers quickly identify areas needing attention.
*   Easily customizable and integrates with tools like spreadsheets and real-time data analysis.

## 3. IT Service Management (ITSM)

**What is ITSM?**
*   A systematized method for managing IT services and their quality.
*   Based on best practices outlined in **ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library)**.
*   Can be outsourced depending on business needs.

**Key Concepts & Relationships:**

*   **ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library):** The standard model (best practice) for IT service management. ITSM uses ITIL as its foundation.
*   **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A formal agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service expected. An IT service is delivered only after an SLA is signed, which then becomes the standard for measuring service quality.
*   **SLM (Service Level Management):** The process of systematically managing IT services to ensure agreed-upon service levels (defined in the SLA) are met.
*   **CSR (Customer Service Request):** The process through which users formally request IT services.

**How ITSM Works:**
1.  **Agreement:** An SLA is signed, setting the service level between the user and service supplier.
2.  **Request:** Users submit IT service requests via the CSR process.
3.  **Delivery & Management:** IT services are delivered at the agreed-upon level, and their quality is systematically managed using SLM based on the SLA standards.

**Leading Standards in ITSM:**
*   **eSCM (eSourcing Capability Model):** An international quality assessment model for service providers to objectively evaluate their capabilities in delivering IT services. It guides IT service implementation across all business phases.
*   **ISO/IEC 20000:** An international standard for IT service management, also rooted in ITIL.

@ DSS data model
The data model in the DSS provides  a framework  for analyzing  data, along with the data with which decision  makers
can make rational  decisions.  Different  types of data models are generated  from different  types of algorithms  and are
continuously  being developed  and improved.  In recent  years, the DSS has been evolving  in the direction  of actively
employing  Al for better  forecasting,  and the types of models  are also diversifying.
<Table  47> Types  of DSS data models
Type of model Description
For a specific  resolution  method,  the what-if  analysis  investigates  how changes  in a given
What-if  Analysis variable  could impact  another  variable.  This is a useful technique  for testing  assumptions
about uncertain  future situations.
This is a technique  for observing  how changes  to one or two variables  affect the rest of the
Sensitivity  Analysis variables  in an equation model consisting  of input and result variables.
. After setting  a goal, this technique  is used to find the values of variables  that will enable anGoal-seeking :enterprise  to achieve  its goal.
oe 5 This i hnique for ining  th imal  value  of  one or more tar; riables given Optimization  Analysis s is a technique  for obtaining the optimal  value  of one or more target  variables  given a
particular  constraint.
C) Understanding  BI
@® Concept  of BI
Business  intelligence  (Bl) is a set of processes  that seeks to improve  the quality  of business  decisions  and business
performance  through  the summarization,  analysis  and use of enterprise  data and information.  If the DSS is the
system for decision makers, and the traditional  concept  is a support system for decision-making,  then BI is the
decision  support  system  that can be adopted  for use by regular  employees.
+ In the narrow sense of the term, BI is a system that improves  the quality of decision-making  in business
management  and improves  the performance  of a business  by summarizing  and analyzing enterprise  data and
information.
+ Intelligence  is the ability to understand  the interrelationships  between  given facts, which could produce  guidance  for
achieving  a desired  goal. (Hans Luhn, IBM, 1958)
+ The general consensus  is that today’s BI evolved from the DSS. Analysis  technologies  such as data warehouses,
OLAPs,  and BI began to be developed  in the late 1980s based on the DSS.
