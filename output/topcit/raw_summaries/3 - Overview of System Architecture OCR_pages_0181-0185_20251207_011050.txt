## Transport Layer Protocols Learning Guide

### 1. Introduction to the Transport Layer

*   **Function:** Transmits application data between **end-point hosts** (e.g., your computer and a web server). This is an **end-to-end service**.
*   **Operation Path:** Protocols operate only between the client and server. **Intermediate nodes (routers) are NOT involved** in the transport layer protocol's operation.
*   **Key Protocols:**
    *   **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
    *   **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)
    *   **SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) - a newer protocol combining TCP/UDP advantages, but TCP and UDP are most widely used.

### 2. TCP vs. UDP: Key Differences

| Feature           | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)           | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)                     |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection**    | **Connection-Oriented**: Requires a pre-configuration process (handshake) to establish and terminate a connection before data transfer. | **Connectionless**: No pre-configuration. Data can be sent/received immediately. |
| **Reliability**   | **Reliable**: Ensures data is delivered correctly and completely. Uses acknowledgment techniques (sequence and acknowledgment numbers) to check receipt. | **Unreliable**: Does not guarantee delivery or order. No built-in error checking for transmitted data. |
| **Data Flow**     | Manages data flow, error detection, and congestion. | Offers minimal overhead for speed.             |

### 3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) in Detail

TCP is a fundamental protocol for reliable communication on the internet.

#### A) Characteristics of TCP

*   **Position:** Operates between the Application Layer and the Network Layer in the TCP/IP model.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   **Stream-based:** Treats data as a continuous stream.
    *   Uses **transmission and reception buffers** to manage data flow.
    *   The underlying IP layer transmits data in **segments** (packets).
*   **Reliability Mechanisms:**
    *   **Flow Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
        *   **Mechanism:** Controls packet flow volume to prevent packet loss when the receiver's buffer capacity is exceeded. Uses sender/receiver buffers.
    *   **Error Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Detects and corrects data transmission errors.
        *   **Mechanism:** Detects and discards damaged/duplicate packets, tracks and resends lost packets.
    *   **Congestion Control:**
        *   **Purpose:** Manages network load to prevent congestion.
        *   **Mechanism:** Controls the rate of data transmission to ensure network load is less than network capacity, preventing performance degradation.
*   **Byte Numbering:**
    *   TCP numbers data in units of bytes.
    *   A **sequence number** is assigned to the first byte of data in each segment.
    *   Sequence numbers range from 0 to 2^m - 1 (where 'm' is the number of bits for the sequence number in the header) and are modular 2^m.

#### B) Well-known TCP Ports

Common services use specific TCP port numbers:

| Service | TCP Port                  | Description             |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| FTP     | 21 (control), 20 (data)   | File Transfer Protocol  |
| SSH     | 22                        | Secure Shell            |
| Telnet  | 23                        | Remote login (unsecure) |
| SMTP    | 25                        | Email sending           |
| HTTP    | 80                        | Web services            |
| POP3    | 110                       | Email receiving         |
| IMAP4   | 143                       | Email receiving         |

#### C) TCP Protocol Header Components

The TCP header contains critical information for managing connections and data.
*   **Size:** 20 bytes (without options), up to 60 bytes (with options).
*   **Key Fields:**
    *   **Source Port:** 16-bit number identifying the sending application's port.
    *   **Destination Port:** 16-bit number identifying the receiving application's port.
    *   **Sequence Number (SEQ):** 32-bit number assigned to the first byte of data in the current segment. Increments by 1 for each byte.
    *   **Acknowledgment Number (ACK):** 32-bit number indicating the next byte sequence number the sender expects to receive.
    *   **Header Length:** 4-bit field specifying the TCP header length in 4-byte units (20-60 bytes).
    *   **Control Flags (6 bits):**
        *   **URG:** Urgent pointer field is significant.
        *   **ACK:** Acknowledgment number field is significant.
        *   **PSH:** Push function (requests immediate delivery).
        *   **RST:** Reset the connection.
        *   **SYN:** Synchronize sequence numbers (used to establish connection).
        *   **FIN:** No more data from sender (used to terminate connection).
    *   **Window Size:** 16-bit field indicating the amount of data (in bytes) the receiver is willing to accept (max 65,536 bytes). Used for flow control.
    *   **Checksum:** 16-bit field for error detection across the header and data.
    *   **Urgent Pointer:** 16-bit field used when urgent data is present (if URG flag is set).

#### D) TCP Connection Establishment: Three-Way Handshake

This procedure establishes a reliable, bidirectional connection between two TCP endpoints (e.g., TCP A and TCP B).

1.  **SYN (Synchronize Sequence Numbers):**
    *   TCP A (client) sends a `SYN` segment with its initial sequence number (e.g., `SEQ=100`) to TCP B (server).
    *   This indicates TCP A wants to establish a connection.

2.  **SYN-ACK (Synchronize Acknowledgment):**
    *   TCP B (server) receives the `SYN`.
    *   TCP B sends a `SYN-ACK` segment to TCP A. This segment contains:
        *   Its own sequence number (e.g., `SEQ=300`).
        *   An acknowledgment number (`ACK=101`), confirming receipt of TCP A's SYN and indicating it expects `SEQ=101` next.
    *   This indicates TCP B acknowledges TCP A's request and is also requesting to establish a connection with TCP A.

3.  **ACK (Acknowledgment):**
    *   TCP A (client) receives the `SYN-ACK`.
    *   TCP A sends an `ACK` segment to TCP B. This segment contains:
        *   An acknowledgment number (`ACK=301`), confirming receipt of TCP B's SYN-ACK and indicating it expects `SEQ=301` next.
    *   This completes the handshake, and a bidirectional connection is established.

*   **Role of SEQ/ACK Numbers:** Crucial for flow and error control, ensuring data streams are transferred correctly byte-by-byte.
*   **TCB (Transmission Control Block):** A system resource allocated by TCP to manage each connection.
*   **SYN Flooding Attack:** A type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack where a malicious actor sends a large number of `SYN` segments without completing the handshake. This exhausts the target server's TCB resources, making it unable to accept new legitimate connections.

* Practical  preview Operating  path of transport  layer protocols
The transport  layer protocols  operate  between  the computer  of user A, and the webserver  myservercom
that requests  data, i.e., end-to-end  service. Data packets  are delivered  through many hops between  a
client and a server. The nodes, positioned  between  the terminals,  such as the wired/Wireless  routers,  are not
involved  in the transport  layer protocol  operation.  TCP [1], UDP [2], and SCTP [3] are the leading  transport

01 Concept  of Transport  Layer Protocol
The transport  layer protocol transmits  application  data between  end-point  hosts. The server application  running  on
the server side receives  a request  from the client side, processes  it, and sends a response  to the client. On the client
side, a user selects  an application  to receive  the service the user wants, makes a request  to the server, and displays
the response  to the user. Applications  that traditionally  use networks,  operate in a client-server  structure,  and the
lowest  protocol,  connecting  the client application  and the server application,  is the transport  layer protocol.
Transport  layer protocols  that have been widely used are TCP (Transmission  Control Protocol)  [1] and UDP (User
Datagram  Protocol)  [2]. SCTP (Stream  Control Transmission  Protocol)  [3], which combines  the advantages  of TCP
and UDP is a new protocol introduced  after 2000. This chapter  focuses  on TCP and UDP which are currently  widely
used.

Overview  of System Architecture )
UDP is usually referred to as a connectionless  service. However,  it does not mean that the service is performed
without  a connection,  but that the pre-configuration  process  for connection  is omitted,  and that data can be sent
and received  immediately.  On the other hand, TCP is a connection-oriented  service and requires  a pre-configuration
process  to connect  before sending  and receiving  data. The connection  is terminated  in order to end the service
between  the client and server  after completing  the data transmission  and reception.
Reliability  is a factor mentioned,  along with the concept  of connection-orientation,  when referring  to TCP and
UDP. UDP is generally  considered  an unreliable  protocol,  and TCP is considered  to provide reliable interprocess
communication.  TCP uses an acknowledgment  technique  that uses a sequence  number  and an acknowledgment
number  to check whether  the receiving  side has properly  received  the transmitted  data.
02 TCP
A) Characteristics  of TCP
TCP is positioned  between  the application  layer and the network  layer in a TCP/IP  model and provides  communication
between  the application  layer processes.  TCP is a stream-based  protocol  and has the transmission  buffer and the
reception  buffer to transfer  data. IP at the lower layer of the TCP protocol,  transmits  data in a packet  format, rather
than a stream format, by partitioning the data into several segments.  Flow control, error control, and congestion
control techniques  are defined  to reliably  deliver  data. TCP is numbered  in units of bytes. When a byte is numbered,  a
sequence  number  is assigned  to the segment.  The maximum  value must be set for a header  to include  the sequence
number  of each packet. If m bits are set for the sequence  number  in the packet  header,  the sequence  number  ranges
from 0 to 2m-1. The sequence  number  is modular  2m.
@ Flow control
Flow control controls  the packet  flow volume  to prevent  packet loss, due to packet inputs exceeding  the reception
limit when transmitting  data packets.  The flow control uses transmission  and reception  buffers  that can store packets
at the sending/receiving  sides, and the sizes of the sending/receiving  buffers are specified  in the files /proc/sys/net/
core/wmem_max  and /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max,  respectively  for Linux systems.
@ Error control
Error control  detects  code errors, that occur during transmission,  and reproduces  accurate  information.  It detects  and
discards  damaged  packets,  tracks and resends  lost or removed  packets,  and checks and discards  duplicate  received
packets.
© Congestion  control
Congestion  occurs when the network  load, representing  the number  of packets  transmitted  to the network  per unit
time, exceeds  the network  capacity,  representing  the number  of packets  that can be processed  by the network  per
unit time. In TC...
