# Cybersecurity Attack Techniques & IoT Security Trends

This guide covers various cyberattack methods and crucial aspects of Internet of Things (IoT) security.

---

## I. Common Attack Techniques

### A. Qshing
*   **Concept:** QR code + Phishing. Induces users to scan malicious QR codes or click links, leading to device infection and financial fraud.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Smartphone infected with malicious code.
    2.  User is redirected to a fake financial site (even when trying to access a legitimate one).
    3.  A malicious app is installed, often disguised as "additional authentication" via a QR code.
    4.  Malicious app steals personal info (security card, phone numbers, texts) and manipulates the mobile environment (e.g., blocks text reception, sets up call forwarding).
    5.  Results in financial damage (payments, transfers).
*   **Evolution:** Often combined with **Pharming** (which targets PC internet banking) to attack smartphone financial information.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Keep security software (anti-virus, web browser) updated.
    *   Disable "Allow Installation from Unknown Sources" on your smartphone.

### B. Smishing
*   **Concept:** SMS + Phishing. Exploits smartphone small payment services using deceptive text messages (e.g., fake coupons, event wins) to install malware.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Victim clicks a malicious internet URL in a text message.
    2.  Malware is installed on the smartphone.
    3.  Criminal requests an authentication number for a small payment.
    4.  Victim inputs the number, thinking it's for purchasing items (e.g., game items, cyber money).
    5.  Small amount payment fraud occurs.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Avoid clicking web links in promotional text messages from unknown sources.
    *   Verify the correct domain URL before accessing any link in a text message.
    *   Install a smishing blocking application.
    *   Cancel app downloads/installations that occur without your consent.
    *   Delete illegal apps using your phone's app management menu.
    *   Check mobile phone billing details if you suspect smishing damage.

### C. Spear Phishing
*   **Concept:** A highly targeted phishing attack. Attackers identify and target specific key personnel within an organization (e.g., those with access to confidential data or critical systems) rather than the general public or an organization's entire network.
    *   Attackers collect information on the target, then send personalized, deceptive emails.
    *   Uses social engineering to gain device authority, then monitors devices, hijacks account information (IDs, passwords), and controls systems using remote tools.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Implement awareness and response training for key personnel (security managers, web server operators, end-users).
    *   Web server operators must prepare countermeasures: detect malicious code, operate web firewalls, and apply server security measures.
    *   Continuously monitor application programs and operating systems for security vulnerabilities and apply security patches regularly.

### D. Cryptojacking
*   **Concept:** Cryptocurrency + Hijacking. Hackers secretly use a user's computing resources (PC or compromised website) to mine virtual currency without their permission.
    *   **Method 1:** Infects a user's PC with malware for cryptocurrency mining.
    *   **Method 2:** Hacks a website and inserts a malicious script (JavaScript) that mines cryptocurrency using visitors' browsers.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   Keep anti-virus programs up-to-date and regularly check for malware.
    *   Use browser extensions designed to block cryptojacking, such as AntiMiner, NoCoin, or MinerBlock.
    *   Block malicious sites (e.g., coinhive.com) using an IP firewall or by configuring detection rules in security equipment (IDS/IPS).

### E. Ransomware
*   **Concept:** Ransom + Software. Malicious software that disables a system or encrypts data, holding it hostage until a ransom (typically cryptocurrency) is paid.
    *   If the ransom is not paid within the specified period, the ransom may increase, or data may become permanently unavailable/deleted.
*   **Major Characteristics:**
    *   Uses **private key encryption**, making batch decryption difficult or impossible if multiple keys are used.
    *   Demands payment in **virtual currency** like Bitcoin.
    *   **No guarantee** of decryption even if payment is made.
    *   Continuously evolves, with new variants constantly appearing (e.g., CryptoLocker, Cryptowall, CryptXXX).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Access to an infection path (e.g., malicious email, infected website).
    2.  Ransomware is downloaded and executed on the PC.
    3.  Ransomware searches for and encrypts target files (documents, images, etc.).
    4.  A demand for money (ransom) is displayed for decryption.
*   **Countermeasures:**
    *   **Keep all active programs updated:** This includes the operating system (Windows), web browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox), and other PC programs (MS Office, Adobe, Java, etc.). Apply security updates immediately to protect against "zero-day attacks" (exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities).
    *   **Install and update anti-virus programs:** Ensure anti-virus is installed on both PCs and smartphones. Regularly update anti-virus engines (automatic updates recommended) and perform real-time and periodic checks.
    *   **Set pop-up blockers:** Block advertising pop-up windows in web browsers to prevent infection from adware distributing malware.
    *   **Limit email address distribution & change passwords regularly:** Avoid publicly distributing your email address to reduce the risk of receiving malware or spear phishing emails. Change account passwords periodically, as hacked email accounts can be used to send spear phishing emails to your contacts.
    *   **Regularly back up important data:** Back up critical documents and files to a separate external storage device and store it securely. Anti-virus programs can remove malware but cannot decrypt files encrypted by ransomware.

### F. Drive-by Download Attack
*   **Concept:** Malware infects a user's PC simply by them accessing a malicious website, without any explicit user action like clicking a download button.
    *   Attacks vulnerable services through the network.
    *   Can infect multiple users simultaneously by compromising a web server they all access.
*   **Consequences:** Infected PCs can cause secondary damage (e.g., DDoS attacks, spam email sending, personal information theft) without the user's knowledge.

### G. "Fileless" Attack
*   **Concept:** An attack that doesn't rely on traditional malware files being installed on the system. Instead, it exploits vulnerabilities (often in web browsers) when a user clicks a malicious link.
*   **Method:** Primarily uses built-in Windows tools like:
    *   **PowerShell:** A task-based shell and scripting language designed for system management and automation in Windows.
    *   **WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command):** A system command input tool for Windows management.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** These attacks are harder for anti-virus tools to detect because they don't involve installing typical malicious software.

### H. Malvertising
*   **Concept:** Malware + Advertising. A technique for distributing malware through online advertising networks or websites.
*   **Why it's effective:**
    *   Online ads attract user attention and are often displayed on high-traffic sites.
    *   Malware can be easily distributed in large quantities as online advertising links to numerous legitimate websites, without the attacker needing to directly hack each site.

## II. Security Trends Related to Latest Information Technology

### A. IoT Security
*   **Overview:** Security is fundamental for promoting IoT technology and enabling new services.
    *   **Increased Risk:** As more devices connect to the internet, the number of potential attack targets and threats grows.
    *   **Critical Impact:** For IoT devices in sensitive areas like healthcare or industrial control, a security breach can lead to physical injury, not just economic damage.
    *   **Privacy Concerns:** The connection of everyday objects to the internet raises significant concerns about personal information leakage and privacy invasion.
    *   **Lifecycle Approach:** Security and privacy protection must be considered at every stage of an IoT device's lifecycle:
        *   **Design and Development:** Incorporate security from the start.
        *   **Deployment and Installation:** Block potential threats before they materialize.
        *   **Setup, Operation, and Execution:** Continuously check for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Destruction Phase:** Ensure secure disposal of data.

*   **Applying Security in the Design/Development Phase:**
    *   **1. Security by Design:**
        *   Minimize misuse of information and devices (confidentiality, integrity/authentication, availability) while accounting for the low power/performance characteristics of IoT devices.
        *   Implement methods for managing device access rights, end-to-end communication security, and service-appropriate integrity/authentication.
        *   Actively review and apply both software and hardware security technologies.
        *   Utilize proven, standard security technologies.
    *   **2. Privacy by Design:**
        *   Apply user privacy protection methodologies by default to IoT devices and service operation policies.
        *   Ensure privacy information collected by IoT devices uses encrypted transmission, anonymous storage, and integrity/authentication.
        *   For collected privacy information, implement de-identification, access control/authentication, confidentiality, and secure storage.
        *   IoT service providers should guarantee maximum transparency by clearly visualizing their operation policies (including the scope and period of privacy information use) to the user.

*   **Applying and Verifying Secure S/W and H/W Development Technology:**
    *   When designing and developing IoT products and services, prioritize secure coding practices.
    *   Conduct thorough software and application security verification.
    *   Utilize secure hardware devices.

(phishing  site), even if the user accesses  a normal financial  site — Inducing  the user to install a malicious app
by showing  a QR code on a fake financial  site, as if additional  authentication  is required  — Stealing personal
information,  such as the security  card, phone numbers,  and text messages, using the malicious  app and
manipulating  the mobile environment,  such as blocking  text message  reception  and call forwarding  service set-
up. — Causing  financial  damage,  such as small amount  payments,  money  transfers,  etc.
@® Combining  Pharming  and Qshing
It was found that malware  is evolving  into a form that combines  pharming,  targeting  the Internet  banking  of
the existing  PC, and Qshing,  targeting  the financial  information  of the smartphone.
@® Response  to QR code-related  attacks
Keep the security of  application  software,  such as an anti-virus  program, a web browser,  etc.,up to date to
prevent  damage  caused by QR code-related  malware.  In addition,  disable the “Allow Installation  from Unknown
Sources’  option in the smartphone  toprevent  the malicious  app from being installed  through  QR codes.
D) Smishing
® Concept  of the smishing  attack
Smishing  is a compound  word of SMS and phishing.  Smishing  is a fraudulent  technique  that exploits  the small
amount  payment  service  of the smartphone,  by using a text message  that disguises  a free coupon  or an event
winning,  as smartphones  become  popular and various financial  services,  such as small amount  payments,  are
increased.

Information  security )
* Cancel download/installation  when an app is installed  without  consent.
+ Delete illegal apps, using the app management  menu, if installed.
* Check the mobile phone billing details if smishing  damage  is expected  (communication  service company  or
payment  agency).
E) Spear phishing
@® Concept  of spear phishing
An attacker  sets key personnel  working  in the company  (those who access confidential  data, critical systems,
etc.) as an attack target, rather than the system or network  of an organization  with well-established
information  security  systems.  The attacker  sends spear phishing  emails, based on the collected  information  on
the target, in the attack preparation  stage. After acquiring  the device authority  of key personnel,  using social
engineering  techniques,  the attacker  hijacks account  information  (ID, passwords,  etc.) by monitoring  the device
for several months  or by control major systems  and networks  using remote control tools.
@ Countermeasures  against  spear phishing
Awareness  and response  training  on spear phishing  should be implemented  for key personnel,  such as
security  managers,  web server operators,  end users, etc. In particular,  web server operators  should prepare
countermeasures,  such as the detection  of malicious  code distribution,  operation  of the web firewall, and web
server security  measures.  For application  programs  and operating  systems,  security  vulnerabilities  should be
continuously  monitored,  and security  patches  should be periodically  applied.
F) Cryptojacking
@® Concept  of cryptojacking
Cryptojacking  is a compound  word of cryptocurrency  and hijacking.  Hackers  mine virtual money using the users’
PC. An attacker  infects a user's PC with malware  to mine cryptocurrency,  by consuming  the infected PC, or
hacks and infiltrates  into a website  and inserts  a malicious  script (JavaScript)  to mine cryptocurrency.
@ Countermeasures  against  cryptojacking
+ Keep the anti-virus  program  up-to-date  and check for malware  infection  on a regular  basis.
+ Use browser  extensions, such as AntiMiner,  NoCoin,  MinerBlock,  etc.
