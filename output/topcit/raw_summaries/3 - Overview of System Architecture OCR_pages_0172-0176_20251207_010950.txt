# **Learning Guide: IPv4 Addressing & Network Management**

This guide provides essential concepts for understanding IPv4 addressing, network partitioning, and address allocation.

---

## **1. IPv4 Address Basics**

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number used to identify devices on a network.

### **A. IPv4 Expression**
*   **Format:** Typically written in Dotted Decimal Notation (e.g., `128.11.3.31`).
*   **Components:** An IPv4 address is divided into two parts:
    1.  **Network Address (Network ID):** Identifies the specific network a device belongs to.
    2.  **Host Address (Host ID):** Identifies a unique device within that network.

### **B. IPv4 Address Classes (Classful Addressing)**
Historically, IPv4 addresses were categorized into classes based on their size and intended use, dictating how bits are allocated for Network and Host IDs.

| Class | Address Range               | Network ID / Host ID Structure   | Default Subnet Mask | Primary Purpose                                 |
| :---- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | `1.0.0.0` - `126.255.255.255` | `NID.HID.HID.HID`                | `255.0.0.0`         | Very large networks, many hosts.                |
| **B** | `128.0.0.0` - `191.255.255.255` | `NID.NID.HID.HID`                | `255.255.0.0`       | Medium to large networks.                       |
| **C** | `192.0.0.0` - `223.255.255.255` | `NID.NID.NID.HID`                | `255.255.255.0`     | Small networks, many networks, few hosts.       |
| **D** | `224.0.0.0` - `239.255.255.255` | *(Multicast)*                    | -                   | Used for multicasting (sending to a group).     |
| **E** | `240.0.0.0` - `255.0.0.0`   | *(Reserved / R&D)*               | -                   | Reserved for future or experimental use.        |

## **2. Special IPv4 Addresses**

Certain IPv4 addresses have specific reserved meanings or uses, often not routable on the public internet.

| Address Type                          | Address / Range                      | Usage                                                                      | Internet Routable? |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Network Address**                   | `Network_ID.0.0.0`                   | Represents the entire network itself.                                      | No                 |
| **Directed Broadcast**                | `Network_ID.255.255.255`             | Sends data to all devices within a specific network.                       | No                 |
| **Specific Host on this Network**     | `0.0.0.Host_ID`                      | Refers to a specific device on the *local* connected network.              | No                 |
| **Loopback Address**                  | `127.0.0.0` - `127.255.255.255` (commonly `127.0.0.1`) | Used by a device to send traffic to itself for testing.                    | No                 |
| **Limited Broadcast**                 | `255.255.255.255`                    | Sends data to all devices on the *local segment*. Routers do not forward. | No                 |
| **This Host**                         | `0.0.0.0`                            | Used by a device when it doesn't know its own IP address (e.g., requesting one). | No                 |
| **Private Addresses**                 |                                      | Used for private networks, not publicly routable without NAT.              | No                 |
| - Class A Private                     | `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255`        |                                                                            |                    |
| - Class B Private                     | `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255`      |                                                                            |                    |
| - Class C Private                     | `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255`    |                                                                            |                    |
| **APIPA** (Automatic Private IP Addressing) | `169.254.0.0` - `169.254.255.255`    | Auto-assigned when a device cannot obtain an IP from a DHCP server.        | No                 |

## **3. Network Partitioning: Subnetting & Supernetting**

### **A. Subnetting**
*   **Concept:** Divides a single large network into multiple smaller, manageable subnetworks.
*   **Purpose:** Improves IP address efficiency, enhances security, reduces network congestion (smaller broadcast domains), and simplifies management.
*   **Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit value that determines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which is the host portion.
    *   `1`s in the mask indicate the network part (including subnet ID).
    *   `0`s in the mask indicate the host part.
*   **How it works:** "Borrows" bits from the Host ID part of an IP address to create a **Subnet ID**.

**Subnetting a Class C Address Example (`255.255.255.0` default mask):**
By extending the subnet mask (borrowing host bits), you create more subnets but reduce the number of hosts per subnet.
| Bits Used for Subnet | Subnet Mask     | Number of Subnets | Max Hosts per Subnet |
| :------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :------------------- |
| **0** (No subnetting)| `255.255.255.0` | 1                 | 254                  |
| **2** bits           | `255.255.255.192` | 4                 | 62                   |
| **3** bits           | `255.255.255.224` | 8                 | 30                   |
*(Note: Hosts per subnet = 2^(number of host bits) - 2 for network and broadcast addresses)*

### **B. Supernetting**
*   **Concept:** The opposite of subnetting. Combines multiple smaller networks (e.g., several Class C networks) into one larger network.
*   **Purpose:** Reduces the size and complexity of routing tables on the internet (route aggregation), improving routing efficiency.
*   **Method:**
    *   Multiple consecutive network address blocks are grouped.
    *   Part of the network identifier bits are used as host identifiers to create a larger host space.
    *   The number of consolidated networks must be a power of 2 and sequential.

---

## **4. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**

*   **Concept:** A flexible addressing scheme that allows for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM), moving away from fixed Class A, B, C boundaries.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **IP Address Conservation:** Uses IP addresses more efficiently by allocating only the necessary number of addresses for a network.
    *   **Routing Table Reduction:** Aggregates routes, reducing the number of entries in internet routers.
    *   **Flexibility:** Network administrators can specify arbitrary network sizes.
*   **CIDR Expression:** `a.b.c.d/x`
    *   `a.b.c.d` is the IP address.
    *   `/x` (the prefix length) indicates the number of bits from the left that constitute the network portion of the address.
    *   **Example:** `200.23.16.0 / 23` means the first 23 bits represent the network, and the remaining 9 bits are for hosts.

---

## **5. IPv4 Address Allocation & Management Protocols**

### **A. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
*   **Purpose:** A network protocol that automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses) to devices (clients) on a network.
*   **Key Process (DORA):** The four main steps for a client to obtain an IP address:
    1.  **DHCPDISCOVER:** Client broadcasts a message to find any available DHCP servers.
    2.  **DHCPOFFER:** DHCP server(s) offer an available IP address and configuration to the client.
    3.  **DHCPREQUEST:** Client selects one of the offers and formally requests that IP address.
    4.  **DHCPACK:** The DHCP server acknowledges the request, confirms the IP address lease, and provides the full configuration.

### **B. NAT (Network Address Translation)**
*   **Purpose:** Enables devices on a private network (using private IP addresses) to communicate with devices on a public network (like the Internet) using a limited number of public IP addresses.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **IP Address Conservation:** Helps mitigate the shortage of public IPv4 addresses.
    *   **Security:** Hides the internal network's IP addresses and structure from external networks, making it harder for attackers to target internal devices directly.
*   **NAPT (Network Address Port Translation) / PAT (Port Address Translation):**
    *   An advanced form of NAT.
    *   Translates both IP addresses and **port numbers**.
    *   Allows multiple internal devices to share a *single* public IP address by mapping different outgoing connections to unique port numbers on the public IP.
    *   Theoretically, can support up to 65,535 internal hosts connecting simultaneously through one public IP address.

[Figure 125] IPv4 Address  Designation  System
The IPv4 addressing  system consists  of a network  address,  assigned  by an Internet  address  resource  management
organization,  and a host address,  assigned  by a network  administrator  to identify  individual  hosts on the network.
As shown in <Table 51>, it is divided into Classes  A, B, C, D, and E, depending  on the network  size or the number  of
hosts. Classes  A, B, and C are for network  configuration  assigned  to general  users, Class  D is for multicast,  and Class
E is an address  reserved  for future use.

In the IPv4 address  designation  method,  subnetting  is the address  partition  method used to separate  a network  ID
into multiple  network  Ids, and supernetting  is a met!hod of integrating  multiple  networks  into a large network.
The 169.254.0.0  network band is reserved  for automatic  private IP addressing.  For versions  after Windows  2000,
DHCP automatically  generates  it to set the IPv4address and cannot  be routed on the Internet.  The addressing
system  is called the automatic  private IP addressing  (APIPA).

In IPv4, there is an addressing  system in a different  form from the conventional  A, B, and C class addressing  system.
These addresses  are called the special IPv4 addresses.  <Table 52> below shows the special IPv4 addresses.
