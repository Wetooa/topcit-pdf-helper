### **Learning Guide: Key ICT Concepts Overview**

This guide provides a structured overview of crucial topics in Application Layer Technologies, Mobile & Multimedia Communication, and Latest Technologies.

---

#### **I. Application Layer Technologies & Web Applications**

*   **1. Application Layer Protocols**
    *   Fundamental understanding of protocols that enable network services for applications.
*   **2. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
    *   The core protocol for data communication on the World Wide Web.
*   **3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
    *   A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

---

#### **II. Mobile & Multimedia Communication Technology**

*   **1. Multimedia Networks**
    *   **A. Graphic Compression Types:** Techniques and standards for reducing the size of image and video data.
    *   **B. Multimedia Data:** Characteristics and handling of various forms of digital content (audio, video, images).
    *   **C. QoS (Quality of Service):** Mechanisms to ensure a certain level of performance for data flow, critical for multimedia applications.
*   **2. Internet Telephony & Call Signal Protocols**
    *   **A. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):** Technology that allows voice calls to be made over a computer network (like the internet) instead of traditional phone lines.
    *   **B. VoIP Call Signal Protocols:** Protocols responsible for setting up, managing, and terminating VoIP calls (e.g., SIP, H.323).
    *   **C. H.323:** An ITU-T recommendation that defines protocols for providing audio-visual communication sessions over packet networks.
    *   **D. VoLTE (Voice over LTE):** High-quality voice calls transmitted over 4G LTE networks, enabling better call quality and simultaneous data usage.
*   **3. Media Transport Protocols**
    *   **A. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** A network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.
    *   **B. RTCP (RTP Control Protocol):** A companion protocol to RTP, used to monitor data delivery and provide minimal control and identification functionality.
    *   **C. RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol):** A network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers.
    *   **D. IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem):** An architectural framework for delivering multimedia services over IP networks.

---

#### **III. Latest Technologies**

*   **1. IoT (Internet of Things) Network-Based Technology**
    *   **A. IoT Concept:** The network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data over the internet.
    *   **B. IoT Standardization Trend:** Efforts and initiatives to establish common standards for IoT devices, platforms, and protocols.
    *   **C. Core IoT Technologies:** Key technologies enabling IoT, such as sensors, connectivity, data processing, and cloud platforms.
    *   **D. Main IoT Protocols:** Primary communication protocols used by IoT devices (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy).
*   **2. Software-Based Networks**
    *   **A. Limitations of Existing Communication Environment & Paradigm Shift:** Challenges with traditional, rigid network infrastructures and the move towards more flexible, software-driven approaches.
    *   **B. SDN (Software Defined Network):** An approach to networking that separates the network's control plane from the data plane, allowing for centralized, programmable network management.
    *   **C. NFV (Network Function Virtualization):** The concept of virtualizing entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that can connect, or chain, together to create communication services.
    *   **D. SDN and NFV:** Understanding how these two technologies complement each other to create more agile, efficient, and scalable network infrastructures.
