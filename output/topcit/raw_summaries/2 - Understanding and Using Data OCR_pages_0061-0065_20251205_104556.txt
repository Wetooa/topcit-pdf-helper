# Data Modeling Learning Guide

## 1. How to Read Relationships in a Data Model

When reading a relationship in a data model, you identify:
1.  **Source Entity**: "one" or "each" source entity.
2.  **Target Entities**: The number of target entities ("one" or "more than one").
3.  **Relationship Options**: (e.g., optional, required)
4.  **Relationship Name**: (e.g., "includes," "belongs to")

**Example Reading Structure:**
"Each [Source Entity] [Relationship Option] [Relationship Name] [Number of Target Entities] [Target Entity]."
*   **Example:** "Each employee sometimes belongs to one department."
*   **Example:** "Each department always includes several employees."

## 2. Characteristics of a Primary Identifier

An identifier can be "primary" or "foreign." A **Primary Identifier** is crucial for uniquely identifying data and has specific characteristics:

*   **Uniqueness:** Each instance within an entity must have a unique primary identifier.
    *   *Example:* An employee number uniquely identifies each employee.
*   **Minimality:** The primary identifier should consist of the minimum number of attributes needed to ensure uniqueness.
    *   *Incorrect Example:* If "employee number" is unique, adding "employee classification code" makes the identifier non-minimal.
*   **Invariability:** Once assigned, the value of a primary identifier should not change.
    *   *Example:* Changing an employee number implies the old record is erased and a new one created.
*   **Presence (Not Null):** A primary identifier must always have a data value; it cannot be null (empty).
    *   *Example:* Every employee must have an employee number.

## 3. Classification of Identifiers

Identifiers are classified based on different criteria:

### A. By Representativeness
*   **Primary Identifier:** Uniquely distinguishes each occurrence within an entity and can connect to other entities (acts as a foreign key).
*   **Alternate Identifier:** Uniquely distinguishes occurrences within an entity but *cannot* connect to other entities (no representativeness for relationships).

### B. By Self-Generation
*   **Internal Identifier:** Created within the entity itself.
*   **Foreign Identifier:** Received from another entity through a relationship.

### C. By Number of Attributes
*   **Single Identifier:** Consists of only one attribute.
*   **Composite Identifier:** Consists of two or more attributes.

### D. By Replacement Status
*   **Natural Identifier:** Created as part of business operations (e.g., an order number generated naturally in a business process).
*   **Artificial Identifier:** Created artificially (not for work) because the natural identifier is too complex.

## 4. Identifier vs. Non-Identifier Relationships

When entities relate, a child entity may inherit attributes from a parent entity's primary identifier. How the child uses this inherited attribute determines the relationship type.

| Feature               | Identifier Relationship                                  | Non-Identifier Relationship                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Expresses a **strong** relationship.                     | Expresses a **weak** relationship.                      |
| **Child's Primary ID** | Inherited attribute becomes part of the child's primary identifier. | Inherited attribute becomes a general attribute of the child. |
| **Notation**          | Indicated by a **solid line**.                           | Indicated by a **dotted line**.                         |
| **Key Considerations**| - Child's primary ID dependent on parent.                | - Child's primary ID configured independently.          |
|                       | - Parent's primary ID *must* be included in child's primary ID. | - Parent's primary ID *may* be included as a general attribute. |
|                       | - Inherited ID attributes may be transferred to *another* entity. | - Inherited ID attributes should be blocked from *other* entities. |
|                       | - Parent's participation in relationship can be optional.  | - Parent's participation in relationship can be optional. |

## 5. Super-type and Sub-type

These are ways to model specialized entities within a general category:

*   **Exclusive Sub-type:** A super-type instance is associated with **only one** sub-type.
    *   *Example:* A "Person" (super-type) can be either an "Employee" OR a "Customer," but not both simultaneously.
*   **Comprehensive Sub-type:** A super-type instance can be associated with **more than one** sub-type.
    *   *Example:* A "Product" (super-type) could be both a "Physical Good" AND a "Digital Good" if it has characteristics of both.

## 6. Connection Traps

Connection traps occur when desired information cannot be accurately retrieved from a data model, even if relationships exist.

### A. Fan Trap
*   **Definition:** Occurs when a relationship branches out (fans out) from a single entity to multiple entities, leading to ambiguity.
*   **When it occurs:** Typically with A -- N:1 --> B -- 1:N --> C relationships. The N:1 relationship leads to confusion about how A and C relate through B.
*   **Example:** If a `Branch` has many `Departments`, and a `Branch` also has many `Employees`, it might be unclear which `Department` an `Employee` belongs to.
*   **Problem:** Cannot determine a direct path from `Employee` to `Department` through `Branch` without ambiguity.
*   **Solution:** Create a direct relationship between the ambiguous entities (e.g., `Employee` belongs to `Department`).

### B. Chasm Trap
*   **Definition:** Occurs due to missing information flow, typically caused by optional relationships.
*   **When it occurs:** When a path between entities includes an optional relationship, potentially leaving some instances unconnected.
*   **Example:** If a `Branch` manages `Vehicles`, and `Employees` own `Vehicles`. If owning a `Vehicle` is optional for `Employees`, we can't tell which `Branch` an employee *without* a vehicle belongs to.
*   **Problem:** Information is "lost" for instances not participating in the optional relationship.
*   **Solution:** Add a required relationship to ensure all instances are connected where logically necessary (e.g., a direct `Employee` belongs to `Branch` relationship, if all employees must belong to a branch).

## 7. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

*   **Definition:** ORM is a programming technique that maps objects in an object-oriented programming language to tables in a relational database.
*   **Core Concept (Class Conversion):** Each class in the object-oriented design typically corresponds to a table in the relational database. This allows developers to interact with database records as objects, simplifying database operations in code.

F) How to read relationships
To read a data model, the identifier reads one or each source entity participating  in the relationship,  followed  by the
number  of target entities  (one, more than one), relationship  options,  and relationship  names.
+ The identifier  reads one or each source entity.
+ The identifier reads the degree of the target entity's participation  in relationships,  that is, the number  (one, more
than one).
+ The identifier  reads the relationship  option and the relationship  name.

|) Identifier  relationship  and non-identifier  relationship
A foreign  identifier  is an attribute  created  in a child entity through  its relationship  with other entities,  not an attribute
needed by a given entity itself The foreign identifier  acts as a foreign key when creating  a database.  The foreign
identifier  can be naturally  identified  by a logical relationship  when the relationship  and attribute,  as well as the primary
identifier,  are defined.  When a primary identifier  is assigned  to an entity and  a relationship  between  the entities is
established,  the child entity's  attributes  are inherited  from the parent’s  primary  identifier.  At this time, it should be
determined  whether  the child entity will use the foreign identifier  received  from the parent  identity  as its own primary
identifier  or not, or whether  it will use it only as a property  that is connected  to the parent.
