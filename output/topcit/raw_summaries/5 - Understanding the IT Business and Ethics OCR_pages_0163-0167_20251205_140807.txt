### 5. O2O (Online to Offline) and O4O (Online for Offline)

#### O2O (Online to Offline)

*   **Definition:** Customers pay for goods or services online and then receive or consume them in an offline physical space. It's the opposite of "showrooming" (browsing offline, buying online).
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Baedal People:** Ordering and paying for food online, then receiving it offline.
    *   **Kakao Taxi:** Booking a taxi via a mobile app, then taking a physical taxi offline.
    *   **Wahome:** Paying online for house cleaning services that are performed offline.

#### O4O (Online for Offline)

*   **Definition:** An online company leverages its online strengths (data, technology, customer base) to operate or innovate an offline business, expanding its scope from online to offline.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Amazon Go:** An offline grocery store operated by Amazon. Customers use a mobile app to enter, pick items, and walk out. Their Amazon account is automatically charged, eliminating queues and cashiers. This leverages Amazon's online technology for offline customer convenience.

+ Deep Learning
Deep learning  is the reason for the recent rapid development  of artificial intelligence.  Deep learning  is a branch of
machine  learning,  and a method  of solving  problems  similarly  to how humans  solve problems  using an artificial  neural
network  which performs  the transfer  and processing  of information  with multiple  nodes. This method is based on
human neural network  theory.

@ Use of Big Data
"Flu Trends" is a quintessential  Big Data service that was launched  by Google  for the general public. In 2008, Google
hit upon the idea that people search for cold or flu on the Internet if they suspect  that they have the flu. The
company  released  a service that predicts  cold and flu trends by analyzing  the search information  and the location  of
the people searching  with keywords  like “flu” and “cold”. Credit card companies  are another  group that rely big time
on Big Data. They analyze consumption  and behavioral  data of their customers  and use it for marketing,  product
development,  and product  recommendation.
Big Data refers to data that is so large that it is difficult  to handle them with traditional  data storage,  management,
and analysis  methods;  they are data whose size has exceeded  the limits of what could be managed  as a general
database.  Big Data is difficult to quantify  through  conventional  methods  because  the 3Vs of vol...
