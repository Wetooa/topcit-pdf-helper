# Database Essentials: Relational Algebra & SQL Basics

## 1. Relational Algebra Operations

Relational algebra uses operators to create new relations (tables) from existing ones.

### Basic Relational Algebra Operations

*   **Join (⋈):** Combines tuples from two relations based on a specified condition.
    *   **Theta Join (⋈θ):** Joins using any comparison condition (e.g., `=`, `<`, `>`, `≠`).
    *   **Equi-Join (⋈=):** Joins using only equality (`=`) conditions. Common attributes appear in duplicate columns.
    *   **Natural Join (⋈*):** Joins using only equality (`=`) conditions on common attributes, which appear only once in the result.
*   **Division (÷):** Selects tuples from one relation (R) that are associated with *all* tuples in another relation (S).

### Extended Relational Algebra Operations

These offer more advanced ways to combine or filter data.

*   **Semi Join (⋉):** Returns tuples from the first relation (R) that have a match in the second relation (S) based on common attributes.
*   **Outer Join (⋈+):** Includes all tuples from both relations, even if there's no match. Unmatched fields are filled with `Null` values.
*   **Outer Union (∪+):** Combines two relations even if they have different numbers of attributes. It expands relations by adding `Null` values for missing attributes so they can be merged.

## 2. Introduction to SQL and Database Management

SQL (Structured Query Language) is crucial for managing and processing data in databases.

### Recent Trends & SQL Importance

*   **Relational Databases Dominant:** Most corporate systems still run on relational databases.
*   **SQL Proficiency Needed:** Software developers must be proficient in SQL for efficient data processing.

### SQL Origin

*   Developed by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlain and F. Raymond Boyce in the early 1970s.
*   Originally named **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language).

### Learning Objectives

After studying, you should be able to utilize:
*   Data Definition Language (DDL)
*   Data Control Language (DCL)
*   Data Manipulation Language (DML) for basic operations, group functions, and advanced joins.

### Key Terms

*   SQL
*   Data Definition Language (DDL)
*   Data Control Language (DCL)
*   Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### Practical Business Relevance

Developers often handle all aspects of database management (creation, modification, deletion of tables and data processing). Therefore, a strong understanding of DDL, DCL, and DML is essential for smooth project execution.

## 3. Types of Relational Database Languages (SQL Categories)

SQL is categorized into three main language types based on their function.

| Classification              | Purpose                                                      | Main Commands (Examples)           |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **DDL** (Data Definition Language) | Defines the database schema (structure of data). Used to create, alter, and delete database objects like tables. | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `RENAME` |
| **DCL** (Data Control Language)   | Controls access to data, manages security, integrity, and concurrency. | `GRANT`, `REVOKE`                  |
| **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) | Manipulates data within the database (search, insert, update, delete). | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |

**Note on TCL:** Sometimes, `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` (for transaction control) are separated into a **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** category.

### Evolution of SQL Standards

SQL standards have been periodically updated by ANSI.

*   **1986 (SQL-86):** First SQL standard.
*   **1992 (SQL-92):** Major revision, focusing on relational databases.
*   **1999 (SQL:1999):** Added features like regular expressions, recursive queries, and triggers.
*   **2003 (SQL:2003):** Included XML-related features, window functions, standardized sequences, and auto-generated values.
*   **2006 (SQL:2006):** Further refinements.
*   **SQL/NM (In Progress):** Focuses on consistent access to metadata.

### Characteristics of SQL:1999 (SQL3)

SQL:1999 introduced features often found in object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS).

*   **Relational Characteristics:**
    *   New data types and conditional expressions.
    *   Strengthened type system.
*   **Object-Oriented Characteristics:**
    *   Support for user-defined types (UDTs), objects, object identifiers.
    *   Reference types, functions, and methods.
*   **Other Additional Functions:**
    *   Recursive query support.
    *   Active database functions (e.g., triggers).
    *   Client-server environment support.
    *   Improved security and view update functions.

## 4. Data Definition Language (DDL) Details

DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure (schema) of your database.

### DDL Commands

*   **`CREATE`:**
    *   **Purpose:** To define and create new database objects.
    *   **Examples:** Creating a table, view, index, schema, or function.
    *   **Key points:**
        *   Primary and foreign keys can be defined when creating a table.
        *   Object names must be unique within their scope.

*   **`ALTER`:**
    *   **Purpose:** To modify the structure of an existing database object.
    *   **Examples:** Adding or deleting columns, or modifying constraints in a table.

*   **`DROP`:**
    *   **Purpose:** To delete a database object and all its associated data and structure.
    *   **Key points:**
        *   Before dropping a table, any constraints that reference it must be deleted first.
        *   Some systems (like Oracle) allow `CASCADE CONSTRAINT` option to delete related constraints simultaneously.

*   **`RENAME`:**
    *   **Purpose:** To change the name of an existing database object (e.g., a table).

+ An operation  to create  a new relation  that is composed  of tuples, which is created  by combining
the tuples of two relations  that meet the join condition  in two or more relations.

after the operator  with join attributes  on to the relation  before  the operator.D< «It has the same effect as projecting  the result of performing  natural join on two
relations  using the attribute  of the relation  before the operator.
Outer  join+ In this operation, if a tuple corresponding  to a tuple in one relation  does not exist
in the other relation,  it is not excluded,  but the other is changed  to a Null tuple to
pet include it in the result.

Database
>> Recent  trends and major issues
Even though the types of databases  have been diversified  recently,  most of the information  systems  used
by corporations  and organizations  are still running  on relational  databases.  Therefore, software  developers
should be familiar  with relational  database  language  and query processing  methods  and should be able to
use them proficiently  in order to process  data efficiently.
SQL was developed  by IBM researchers  Donald D. Chamberlain  and F. Raymond  Boyce in the early 1970s.
SQL began with the name of SEQUEL  (Structured  English  Query Language)  and was devised  to manipulate
and receive  the data stored in System  R, which was the semi-relational  database  management  system of
IBM. Recently,  interest  in acquiring  SQL-related  certifications  has been increasing  because  the importance
of SQL has been highlighted.
>> Learning  objectives
1. To be able to utilize a Data Definition  Language  (DDL).
2. To be able to utilize a Data Control Language  (DCL).
3. To be able to utilize the basic operation,  group function,  and advanced  join of a Data Manipulation
Language  (DML).

ESSENCE
+ Preview  for practical  business
Since most of the recent information  systems  store data in a database,  an adequate  database  processing
language  is needed  to process  values by linking a program  to a database.  In particular,  as more than 90%
of the databases  adopted  by a project  are mostly  relational  databases  in the majority  of cases, developers
should be familiar with the relational  database  language.  So how well should developers  familiarize
themselves  with the relational  database  language?  Objects  such as tables and views are managed  by the
data architect  (DA) or the database  administrator  (DBA) in some large-scale  projects;  however,  developers
manage  everything  from table creation/change/delete  to data processing  in most projects.  Therefore,
it is desirable  for the developer  to know all of the data definition  language  (DDL), data control language
(DCL), and data manipulation  language  (DML) of the relational  database,  in order to perform those tasks
smoothly.  That is, relational  database  languages  are one of the key database  build and operation  areas that
developers  should know well, and it is recommended  for developers  to learn those languages  to such a level
that they can use the syntax  quite freely,
