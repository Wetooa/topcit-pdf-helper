*   **Components (Covers entire lifecycle: development to execution & operation):**
    1.  **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** For project setup, coding, and testing (simulators).
    2.  **Mobile Framework (Execution Environment):** Provides a meta (abstraction) layer for "one source, multi-use," acting as middleware to execute platform/device-independent code and offer device API wrappers.
    3.  **Distribution Management (Execution Environment):** Manages mobile app distribution and versioning.
    4.  **Back-end Integrated Interface (Execution Environment):** Standard interface for integrating with and reusing existing legacy systems.
    5.  **Mobile Device Management (MDM) (Operations Environment):** For device management, app management, security management, access control, and lost device management.
    6.  **Service Operations and Management (Operations Environment):** Integrated interface monitoring and management.

### 3. MDM (Mobile Device Management)

*   **Definition:** A solution for efficiently managing diverse mobile devices and applications within an enterprise. It enables management anytime, anywhere via Over-The-Air (OTA) transmissions (device must be on).
*   **Main Functions:**
    *   **Device Management:** Collects device info, manages distribution, identifies device IDs.
    *   **Registration & Tracking:** Registers, approves, recalls devices; freezes device use if lost/stolen.
    *   **Security Policy:** Establishes and enforces security policies based on company/group rules, integrates with internal active directory.
    *   **Software Distribution:** Manages and distributes software updates.
    *   **Authentication:** Authenticates devices.
*   **Component Elements & Roles:**
    *   **MDM Gateway Server:**
        *   Located in DMZ (screened subnet).
        *   Authenticates connections between internal network and mobile devices.
        *   Facilitates communication (e.g., direct push updates).
    *   **MDM Device Management Server:**
        *   Manages and operates mobile devices.
        *   Distributes group policies and software.
        *   Communicates with other enterprise infrastructures.
    *   **MDM Enrollment Server:**
        *   Assigns authentication to recalled devices or upon certification requests.
        *   Uses One-Time Password (OTP) for device certification.
    *   **Databases:** Stores management, configuration, work, and setup data for MDM Device Management and Enrollment Servers.
*   **Deployment Effects (Benefits):**
    *   Increased flexibility and expandability.
    *   Ability to connect to diverse services.
    *   PC-level device management.
    *   Consistent security enforcement.
    *   Easy remote support and troubleshooting.
    *   OS, language, and system support.

### 4. Smart Business Infrastructure

**A. Convergent Infrastructure**

**B. M2M (Machine-to-Machine)**
*   **Definition:** Communication directly between machines.
*   **Purpose:** Integrates information to network/platform to monitor object status, control situations, and send information to users or intelligent devices.
*   **Typical Service Types:**
    *   **Remote Monitoring:** Environment monitoring, remote metering.
    *   **Remote Control:** Remote control of assets, m-POS (mobile point-of-sale).
    *   **Asset Management:** Security systems, vending machines, fleet management, delivery management.
*   **Reasons for M2M Growth:**
    1.  **Expanding Wireless Networks:** Increased coverage and stability.
    2.  **Declining Telecommunication Module Prices:** Lower costs, rapid market penetration.
    3.  **Declining Sensor Prices:** More sophisticated sensors at lower costs, enabling sensing-based services.
*   **M2M Device Components:**
    *   **Module:** Contains a mobile chipset. Crucial for purpose-built devices and standardization.
    *   **Chipset:** The core processing unit.
    *   **Sensor/Input & Output Unit:** Acquires data.
    *   **Data Processing Unit:** Processes acquired data.
    *   **Communication Module:** Sends processed data (e.g., via RS-232, USB).
*   **Standardization:** Crucial for market growth; current top-down approach (service layer defining lower layers) hinders public sharing and standardization.

**C. IoT (Internet of Things)**
*   **Definition:** Creates an environment where *everything* (people, objects, spaces) is connected to the Internet to create, collect, share, and utilize information.
*   **Evolution:** The idea has existed and evolved over time, not a sudden phenomenon.
*   **IoT vs. M2M:**
    *   **M2M:** Often specialized and siloed within specific industry sectors.
    *   **IoT:** Connects these disparate M2M technologies under a universal communication network (the Internet) to offer more diverse and dynamic services. IoT is a broader concept encompassing M2M.
*   **Examples of Services:**
    *   **M2M Roots:** Barcodes, RFID, Process Control.
    *   **IoT Evolution:** Sensor Networks, Big Data, Connected Cars, Smart Grid, NFC/iBEACON, Device-to-Device (D2D).
    *   **Internet of Everything (IoE):** Distributions, Mobile Cloud, Big Data.
*   **Market Outlook:**
    *   **Phase:** Currently in introduction/early growth.
    *   **Growth:** Expected to grow >20% annually, reaching $1.2 trillion by 2022.
    *   **Value Creation:** Reduces transaction costs between physical and digital worlds, improves productivity, creates new markets.
    *   **Trends:** Mobile-centric networks, integration with Big Data, shift from supplier to buyer's market.
*   **Functions Driving Growth:**
    *   Optimization.
    *   Integration with other social infrastructures (cross-industry).
    *   Social infrastructure management.
*   **Social Benefits:** Improves efficiency of social infrastructure, responds to societal needs (broader impact beyond personal convenience).

Mobile Enterprise  Application  Platform  (MEAP) is a platform  that can support  a wide range  of different  device
environments  and permit  the sharing  and the reuse of applications.
+ The main reasons  behind the need for MEAP are reuse and cost savings.
- Allows the same code to be reused for different  smartphone  OS/smartphone  HW/service  provider  environments.
- Through  the sharing  of a common  platform,  companies  can save money that would others have to be spent on
duplicate  infrastructure  and middleware  required  for services.
- Support  for developing  the mobile screens  for different  types of devices.
- Support  for testing  and interworking

MEAP covers the entire life cycle from mobile development  to execution  and operation.  It is composed  of an
integrated  development  environment  (IDE), an execution  environment  framework  that acts a middleware, standard
interface  for integrating  with legacy  system, and a mobile device management  (MDM) for device management  and
security.
