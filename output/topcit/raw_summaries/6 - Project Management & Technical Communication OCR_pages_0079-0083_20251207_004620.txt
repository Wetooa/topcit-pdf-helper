# Project Management & Technical Communication: Learning Guide

## 1. Project Life Cycles

Project life cycles describe how a project progresses from start to finish. There are three main types:

### A) Predictive Life Cycle (Waterfall)
*   **Description:** The entire project scope, schedule, and cost are defined upfront at the beginning. Activities are carried out according to a detailed plan.
*   **Best For:** Projects with mature technology or extensive experience.

### B) Iterative Life Cycle
*   **Description:** A product is developed in parts, repeatedly, to complete the final product.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Incremental Life Cycle:** Project scope is divided into multiple phases. Activities in these phases run in parallel and overlap gradually.
    *   **Evolutionary Life Cycle:** Project is divided into several phases, and each iteration proceeds sequentially.

### C) Adaptive Life Cycle (Agile)
*   **Description:** An agile process that responds quickly to external changes. Its purpose is to flexibly adapt to changing requirements to maximize project value.

## 2. Project Initiation: Planning & Execution Stages

Before a project is contracted and started, it typically goes through specific stages:

### A) Key Stages
1.  **Planning Stage:**
    *   Preliminary work like feasibility analysis and budget planning.
2.  **Acquisition Stage:**
    *   Scope definition.
    *   **RFP (Request For Proposal):** A document issued to solicit proposals from potential vendors.
    *   RFP briefing (if necessary).
3.  **Contracting Stage:**
    *   Evaluation of submitted proposals.
    *   Selection of the business operator (vendor).
    *   Technical negotiations and final contracting.

### B) Importance of Early Planning (Project Cost/Efforts Curve)
*   **Concept:** Spending adequate time on planning in the early stages helps avoid confusion and exponentially increasing costs/efforts later in the project.
*   **Benefit:** Allows for predicting risks, establishing response plans, and handling unexpected problems effectively.
*   **Risk of Poor Planning:** Jumping directly into execution with a poor initial plan can lead to rapid progress initially but cause significant confusion and cost increases later.

### C) The Proposal Process (Developer's View)
*   **Purpose:** To win a project contract based on the acquirer's RFP.
*   **Content:** Outlines the proposal, introduces the proposing company, and details project execution and management.
*   **Process:** Developers submit a proposal, which is evaluated. If selected as the preferred bidder, a contract is concluded after technical negotiation, and the project begins.

## 3. Project Management Methodologies

Common structured approaches to managing projects:

### A) PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
*   **Origin:** Published by PMI (Project Management Institute), a US non-profit.
*   **Structure (6th Edition):**
    *   **5 Process Groups:** Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing.
    *   **10 Knowledge Areas:** Scope, Cost, Schedule, Quality, Risk, Communication, Resources, Procurement, Stakeholder, Integration Management.
    *   **49 Processes** in total.
*   **Key Addition (6th Ed.):** Project manager's **Talent Triangle** (Technical Project Management, Leadership, Strategic and Business Management).
*   **Certification:** PMI offers the PMP (Project Management Professional) qualification.

### B) ISO 21500
*   **Origin:** An international project management standard established by ISO (International Standard Organization).
*   **Similarity:** Overall content is similar to PMBOK.

### C) PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments)
*   **Origin:** Developed in the UK, mainly used in Europe and Australia.
*   **Approach:** A structured methodology focused on practical project management, emphasizing various participants and outputs beyond just the project manager.
*   **Components:**
    *   **7 Principles:** E.g., Continued Business Justification, Learn From Experience, Manage by Stages.
    *   **7 Themes:** E.g., Business Case, Organization, Risk, Quality.
    *   **7 Processes:** E.g., Starting Up A Project, Directing A Project, Managing Product Delivery.

## 4. Agile Methodology

### A) Core Concept
*   **Description:** An adaptive model that continuously creates prototypes, adding and modifying requirements in a timely manner.
*   **Contrast:** Differs from traditional methods that rely on thorough upfront planning and explicit outputs.

### B) Agile Manifesto Principles
The core values guiding Agile software development:
*   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
*   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
*   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
*   **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### C) Scrum (Most Representative Agile Method)
*   **Origin:** Adopted in software development by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in 1995.
*   **Approach:** A mutually progressive development methodology for project management.
*   **Key Processes:**
    *   Sprint Planning
    *   Daily Scrum
    *   Sprint Review
    *   Sprint Retrospective
*   **Main Deliverables:**
    *   Product Backlog
    *   Sprint Backlog
    *   Burndown Charts
*   **Quality Management:** Achieved through repetitive reviews (e.g., daily scrum meetings, sprint reviews).

## 5. PMBOK/ISO 21500 Project Knowledge Areas

This framework divides project management into 10 key areas.

1.  **Project Integration Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Managing processes and activities to identify, define, and coordinate all aspects of the project.
2.  **Scope Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Defining customer requirements and the total products/services provided. Includes designing the **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)** – a hierarchical decomposition of project work.
3.  **Schedule Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Developing a project schedule, allocating resources efficiently, and ensuring project completion within agreed timelines.
4.  **Cost Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Managing cost planning, calculation, budgeting, and controlling activities to complete the project within the approved budget.
5.  **Resource Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Properly securing and utilizing project resources (people, equipment, materials) in a timely manner.
6.  **Communication Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Managing the creation, collection, storage, distribution, control, and monitoring of project information requirements for stakeholders.
7.  **Quality Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Managing quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control activities to meet project requirements.
8.  **Procurement Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Managing activities related to procuring products and services from outside the project (e.g., contract management, change control, contract closing).
9.  **Risk Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Identifying, analyzing, and responding to potential risks to increase the likelihood of project success.
10. **Stakeholder Management:**
    *   **Focus:** Identifying all individuals or organizations that influence the project and developing strategies to effectively manage their expectations and interests.

product  development  and architectural  projects  with much accumulated  technology  or experience.  It is a cycle
in which the entire scope of the project  is defined  at the initiating  stage and the schedule  and cost are carried
out according  to the plan.
The iterative  life cycle is a model in which a product  is divided  into parts that are developed  repeatedly  to
complete  a final product.  Iterative  life cycles can be divided into incremental  and evolutionary  types.
+ Incremental  life cycle: The scope of the project is divided into multiple  phases in which the activities  of the
project  are run in parallel and overlapped  gradually  and repeatedly.
+ Evolutionary  life cycle: The project is divided into several phases, and the iteration itself proceeds
sequentially.

planning,  acquisition, and contracting  stage.
In the planning  stage, preliminary  work such as feasibility  analysis  and budget  planning  of the project  is carried
out. In the acquisition  stage, scope definition  and Request  For Proposal  (RFP) are carried out, and if necessary,
a RFP briefing  can be held. Subsequently,  in the contracting  phase, the proposal  submitted  to select a business
operator  is evaluated,  and the final business  operator  selection  and contracting  are conducted  through
technical  negotiations.
When planning  a new project,  it is necessary  to approve  the unit project or program  according  to the portfolio
under management  to achieve  the organization's  enterprise-wide  strategic  goals. In addition,  a high-level  plan
for the project should be reviewed by considering  whether  there is an integrated  management  program  for
relevant  projects.
There is a Project  Cost/Efforts  Curve as shown below that demonstrates  the importance  of the initial project
planning  stage. If enough  time is spent on planning  in the early stages, unnecessary  confusion  can be avoided
in the latter stages. This is because,  if you predict  various  risks or issues that may occur during initial planning,
and establish  a response  plan in advance,  or a process  for handling  unexpected  problems,  you can respond
effectively  in case of various risks or issues that may arise in the project process.  On the other hand, if the
initial plan is poorly formulated  and executed  right away, the project may seem to be progressing  quickly at
first yet cause confusion  at an exponential  rate as it moves through  the latter stages. Many projects  neglect
the initial planning  stage and jump directly  to the executing  stage, resulting  in a failure of the entire project.
[Figure  24] Project  Cost/Efforts  Curve
From the developer's  point of view, a proposal  is made in advance  to initiate a project. A proposal  is the act
of writing and submitting  a document  to the acquirer  to win the order based on the RFP from the acquirer. It
contains  the proposal  outline, introduction  of the proposing  company,  project execution and management.
After the evaluation  of the submitted  proposal,  if it is selected  as the preferred  bidder, the contract  is
concluded  through  technical  negotiation,  and the project  begins.
