# System Architecture: Application Layer Protocols

## 1. Overview of Application Layer Protocols

### 1.1 What is the Application Layer?
*   The **Application Layer** is the top layer in the networking model.
*   **Function:** Programs at this layer operate end-to-end, meaning they communicate directly between the client and server applications.
*   **Independence:** Intermediate network devices (like routers) do not affect how application layer protocols operate.
*   **Compatibility:** Most widely used application programs use internationally recognized standard application layer protocols to ensure compatibility between different systems.

### 1.2 How Application Layer Programs Communicate
*   Application layer programs use **socket programming** to transmit and receive user data through the **Transport Layer** (e.g., TCP or UDP).
*   **Example Scenario (Web Usage):**
    1.  **Connection Request:** Client (web browser) sends a connection request to the web server (e.g., for `my.server.com` homepage).
    2.  **HTTP GET Request:** Client sends an HTTP GET request (e.g., `GET / HTTP/1.1`) for the homepage.
    3.  **Server Response:** Server acknowledges and sends the homepage data (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK (text/html)`).
    4.  **Connection Termination:** Connection for the homepage is terminated.
    5.  **Repeat for Files:** The process repeats for additional files like `my.pdf`.

## 2. Key Application Layer Protocols

Application layer protocols are used to exchange necessary information between application programs.

### 2.1 Common Application Layer Protocols
*   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** For transferring files.
*   **Telnet:** For terminal connections.
*   **SMTP, POP3, IMAP:** For email transmission and access.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** For mapping hostnames to IP addresses.
*   **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** For network management.
*   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** For data transmission between web clients and web servers.
*   **BitTorrent:** A P2P (peer-to-peer) protocol for file sharing.

### 2.2 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
*   **Definition:** An application layer protocol for hypermedia information systems (connecting text with video, audio, etc.).
*   **History:**
    *   Used since the early 1990s.
    *   **HTTP/0.9:** Simple, low-level data transfer.
    *   **HTTP/1.0:** Introduced MIME-type messages.
    *   **HTTP/1.1:** Current version, designed for reliability.
*   **Model:** Operates as a **request/response protocol** in a client-server environment.
    *   **Client (e.g., web browser):** Sends a request message.
    *   **Server (e.g., Apache HTTP Server):** Sends a response message.
*   **HTTP Request Message Format:**
    *   `<request method, URI, protocol version, MIME type information message>`
*   **HTTP Response Message Format:**
    *   `<protocol version, success or error code, MIME type, server information, etc.>`
*   **Common HTTP Methods (in Request-Line):**
    *   **GET:** Primarily used to *retrieve* content from the server (e.g., accessing a website).
    *   **POST:** Primarily used to *send* user input information to the server (e.g., submitting a form).
*   **HTTP Status Codes (in Response Message):**
    *   **2xx (e.g., 200 OK, 206 Partial Content):** Request processed successfully.
    *   **4xx:** Client error.
    *   **5xx:** Server error.

### 2.3 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
*   **Definition:** A protocol designed specifically for transferring files between systems.
*   **Unique Feature: Two Connections**
    1.  **Control Connection:**
        *   Uses **Port 21**.
        *   Maintained throughout the FTP session.
        *   Used for sending commands from client to server and receiving responses.
    2.  **Data Connection:**
        *   Uses **Port 20** (or other dynamic ports depending on the mode).
        *   Established only when a file transfer starts.
        *   Used for the actual transfer of file data.
*   **FTP Transfer Modes:**
    *   **1. General (Active) Transfer Mode:**
        *   **Concept:** The server initiates a connection to the client's specific port for data transfer.
        *   **Issue:** Can cause problems with firewalls because the server tries to connect *into* the client's network.
        *   **Ports:** Control: 21, Data: 20 (server connects to client's specified port).
        *   **Operation Steps:**
            1.  Client connects to server's port 21 and tells the server which client port to use for data (e.g., 5151).
            2.  Server acknowledges (ACK).
            3.  Server's port 20 attempts to connect to the client's specified data port (e.g., 5151).
            4.  Client acknowledges (ACK).
    *   **2. Passive (PASV) Transfer Mode:**
        *   **Concept:** The client requests a connection to the server's data port.
        *   **Benefit:** Allows clients behind firewalls/proxy servers to connect easily because the client initiates all connections.
        *   **Ports:** Control: 21, Data: 1024 or higher (client connects to server's specified port).
*   **FTP Command Types (Examples):**
    *   **Access Commands:** `USER`, `PASS`, `QUIT` (e.g., for login/logout)
    *   **File Management Commands:** `CWD` (change directory), `DELE` (delete), `LIST`, `MKD` (make directory)
    *   **Data Forming Commands:** `TYPE` (specify data type, e.g., ASCII, binary)
    *   **Port Definition Commands:** `PORT`, `PASV` (switch to passive mode)
    *   **File Transfer Commands:** `GET`, `PUT`, `RETR` (retrieve), `STOR` (store)
    *   **Other Commands:** `HELP`, `NOOP`

[Figure 138] shows the operational  path of the application  program  over the Internet.  It shows that
application  layer programs,  like transport  layer protocols,  operate  on the service  end-to-end.  In other words,
like transport  layer protocols,  such as TCP, the nodes, like wired/wireless  routers  positioned  between  end-
points, do not affect the operation  of transport  layer protocols.  Although  users can generate  and exchange
them as needed, the most widely used application  programs  tend to use the internationally  recognized
standard  application  layer protocols  in order  to ensure compatibility.

[Figure 139] Virtual Scenario  of Application  Layer Operation
This section describes  the part related to the HTTP protocol  in [Step 1] and [Step 3-4] of the network
operational  procedure  in user A’s web usage scenario  @ in “l. Network  concept”. A web browser  and an
application  program  are connected  to the web server program,  httpd, through  a TCP connection  and plays
the role of fetching  the web content  that is desired by user Athen converting  it into a user-friendly  form.
The web browser  uses the HTTP/1.1  protocol  for communication  with the webserver.  The HTTP/1.1  protocol
is a text-based  application  layer protocol [8]. Text data created, according  to the HTTP/1.1 protocol,  is
delivered  to the other application  layer program  through  the transport  layer protocol.
The application  layer program uses socket programming  to transmit  and receive user data through  the
transport  layer. Socket programming  is a programming  technique  that is crucial for implementing  the
application  layer protocol,  but it is out of the scope of this guide's  contents.  Refer to other books for more
details.

01 What is Application  Layer Protocol?
Anyone managing  a network  system or developing  a network  application  program  often encounters  application
layer technology.  The application  layer protocol  is used to exchange  necessary  information  between  application
programs.  Widely used application  layer protocols  include FTP [1] for file transfer,  telnet [2] for terminal  connection,
SMTP [3], POP3 [4], and IMAP [5] for e-mail transmission  and access, DNS [6] for mapping  hostnames  and IP
addresses,  and SNMP [7] for network  management.  HTTP [8], which is used for data transmission  between  web
clients and webservers,  is also an application layer  protocol.  The BitTorrent  protocol  is also a widely used application
layer protocol,  although  it is a P2P (peer-to-peer)  protocol,  not a method  of accessing  network  infrastructure,  as
conventional  communication  protocol  does.
02 HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol)  is an application  layer protocol  for a hypermedia  information  system that
connects  text with video and audio files. It has been used for transferring  web contents  since the early 1990s [8].
The first version, HTTP/0.9,  was a simple protocol  for low-level  data transfer  through  the Internet,  but MIME-type
messages  have been defined and used since HTTP/1.0 (RFC  1945). HTTP/1.1 is the current  version in use and is
designed  to be more reliable  than HTTP/1.0.
Like most standard  application  protocols,  the HTTP protocol  implements  a request/response  protocolthat  is suitable
for a client-server  environment.  Since web browsers,  such as Microsoft’s  Internet  Explorer,  Google Chrome,  Mozilla
Firefox, and web servers, such as Apache HTTP Server, imp...
