# Information Security Learning Guide

## 1. IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)

IPSec is a suite of protocols that provides security for IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet.

### 1.1 Transport Mode vs. Tunnel Mode

IPSec operates in two main modes:

*   **Transport Mode:**
    *   **What it protects:** Only the payload (data) of the IP datagram (upper-layer protocol).
    *   **IP Header:** The original IP header remains unchanged.
    *   **Use Case:** Typically used for host-to-host protection (e.g., protecting TCP fragmentation or ICMP packets). Operates right above the IP layer.
    *   **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** Encrypts the IP payload; authentication is optional.
    *   **AH (Authentication Header):** Authenticates the IP payload and *selected parts* of the IP header.

*   **Tunnel Mode:**
    *   **What it protects:** The *entire* original IP datagram, including its header.
    *   **IP Header:** A *new, external* IP header is created, and the original IP datagram becomes its payload.
    *   **Use Case:** Primarily used for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to connect entire networks or hosts to networks. A router often acts as an IPSec proxy.
    *   **Anonymity:** No router can inspect the internal IP header while the datagram is in transit.
    *   **ESP:** Encrypts *all internal IP datagrams* (including the internal IP header); authentication is optional.
    *   **AH:** Authenticates *all internal IP datagrams* and *selected parts* of the *external* IP header.

### 1.2 Security Association (SA)

*   **Purpose:** To establish secure communication, IPSec needs to know which authentication/encryption algorithms, keys, and other security parameters to use. An SA stores this information.
*   **Identification:** Each SA is uniquely identified by:
    *   **Security Parameter Index (SPI):** A randomly generated value.
    *   **Destination IP Address.**
*   **Direction:** One SA is needed for secure communication in one direction. For two-way communication between two parties, *two* SAs are required.
*   **Process (Simplified):**
    1.  **Initiation:** System A wants to communicate securely with System B.
    2.  **SA Lookup:** System A finds the relevant SA for System B in its Security Association Database (SAD).
    3.  **Encryption & Send:** Using the SA's encryption key and algorithm, System A encrypts the IP datagram, adds the SPI to the IPSec header, and sends it.
    4.  **Receive & SA Lookup:** System B receives the encrypted datagram, uses the SPI and source IP address (A) from the IPSec header to find the corresponding SA in its SAD.
    5.  **Decryption:** System B uses the SA's key and algorithm to decrypt the IP datagram.

### 1.3 IKE (Internet Key Exchange)

*   **Function:** IKE handles the cryptographic key management for IPSec.
*   **Key Management:** It determines, distributes, creates, stores, negotiates, modifies, and removes SAs.
*   **Key Requirement:** Four keys are typically needed for two-way communication (a pair of sending/receiving keys for integrity and another pair for confidentiality).
*   **Process:** IKE establishes SAs through secure authentication between two applications by exchanging messages.

### 1.4 IPSec Utilization

*   Implementing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
*   Providing security for application layer services (e.g., secure remote access, e-commerce).

## 2. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security)

### 2.1 Concept

*   **Origin:** Developed by Netscape as SSL (version 3.0), later standardized by IETF and renamed TLS (Transport Layer Security).
*   **Position:** Sits between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer (TCP) in the TCP/IP model.
*   **Purpose:** Provides reliable end-to-end secure services over TCP.
*   **Common Use:** Most widely used with HTTP, resulting in **HTTPS**.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **SSL Connection:** A temporary, peer-to-peer transport that provides secure services. All connections are associated with a single session.
    *   **SSL Session:** An association between a client and a server that defines shared cryptographic security parameters. It's established via the handshake protocol and reused across multiple connections to avoid re-negotiating security parameters each time.

### 2.2 Structure and Operation

SSL is composed of four main protocols:

*   **Handshake Protocol:**
    *   **Purpose:** Mutual authentication between server and client. Negotiates the encryption algorithm, MAC algorithm, and cryptographic keys to be used.
    *   **Timing:** Performed *before* any application data is transferred.
*   **Record Protocol:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides confidentiality and integrity for SSL connections.
    *   **Function:** Encrypts application data messages using the negotiated symmetric key.
*   **Change Cipher Spec Protocol:**
    *   **Purpose:** Notifies the other party that the newly defined authentication and encryption system (cipher specification) will be applied from now on.
    *   **Message:** A simple one-byte message with a value of 1.
*   **Alert Protocol (Warning Protocol):**
    *   **Purpose:** Delivers warnings or fatal error messages during SSL operation.
    *   **Message:** A 2-byte message; the first byte conveys the severity (Warning=1, Fatal=2).

### 2.3 Operating Procedure (Simplified Handshake)

1.  **Client Hello:** Client sends a "Hello" message, requesting an SSL connection.
2.  **Server Hello:** Server responds with "Server Hello," its digital certificate, and its public key (may also request client's certificate).
3.  **Client Key Exchange:** Client verifies the server's certificate. It then generates a session key (pre-master secret), encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it. (If requested, the client also sends its own certificate).
4.  **Change Cipher Spec (Client):** Client sends a "Change Cipher Spec" signal, indicating it will now use the newly negotiated algorithms and key for encryption.
5.  **Change Cipher Spec (Server) & Encrypted Data:** Server acknowledges, sends its own "Change Cipher Spec," and then encrypted data exchange begins using the agreed-upon security parameters.

### 2.4 SSL Utilization

*   **Installing an SSL Certificate:**
    1.  Create a private key on the web server.
    2.  Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
    3.  Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA).
    4.  Receive the SSL certificate from the CA and install it on the web server (or SSL accelerator).

*   **How to Check SSL Application:**
    *   **URL Bar:** Displays "https://" and a padlock icon.
    *   **Warnings:** May show a security warning if the page switches between secure (HTTPS) and non-secure (HTTP) content.
    *   **Certification Seal:** Reputable sites often display a security certification seal (e.g., GeoTrust, VeriSign).

*   **Considerations on Load:**
    *   **Problem:** The SSL handshake process is CPU-intensive, creating a heavy workload on servers.
    *   **Solution:** **SSL Accelerators** are hardware (PCI cards or dedicated devices) or software functions (in web accelerators or L4 switches) designed to offload SSL processing from the main CPU.
    *   **Post-Application Steps:**
        *   Change all relevant URLs (connection, web application source) to "https://".
        *   Improve response speed for static content (images, JavaScript, CSS) by using SSL web browser caching or a web accelerator to offload SSL processing.

## 3. WLAN Security (Wireless LAN Security)

### 3.1 Characteristics of WLAN

*   **Medium:** Wireless LANs use radio waves, broadcasting data through the air.
*   **Exposure:** This means data is inherently exposed to all wireless LAN users in range during transmission.
*   **Vulnerability:** WLANs are inherently more vulnerable than wired LANs due to the shared, open nature of the radio communication medium.
*   **Importance:** Security must be a primary concern, especially in public wireless LAN environments where the risk of incidents is high.

### 3.2 WLAN Structure (IEEE 802.11)

*   **Basic Service Set (BSS):**
    *   A fundamental unit composed of stations (STAs) that compete for access to the same wireless medium.
    *   All STAs within a BSS operate under the same MAC (Media Access Control) protocol.
*   **Extended Service Set (ESS):**
    *   An environment where multiple BSSs are connected to a "distribution system" (e.g., a wired network).
    *   This allows STAs in different BSSs to communicate with each other.

+ Transport  mode and tunnel mode
AH and ESP support  transport  mode or tunnel mode. As shown in [Figure 63], IP headers  do not change and
only the payload  of the IP datagram  is encrypted  in transport  mode, whereas  all IP datagrams  are encrypted
and transmitted  as the payload  of a new IP packet  in tunnel mode. In general,  the router plays a proxy role of
IPSec in tunnel mode.
The transport  mode is mainly used to protect  the upper layer protocol,  which is the payload range of the IP
datagram.  For example, it is used to protect TCP fragmentation  or ICMP packets. IPSec in transport  mode
operates  right above the IP layer. ESP encrypts the  IP payload,  but it does not encrypt  the IP header in
transport  mode, and authentication  is optional.  AH only authenticates  the IP payload and selected  parts of
the IP header  in transport  mode.
Tunnel mode protects  all IP datagrams.  To this end, an “external”  IP datagram  that has a new external  IP
header is created. No router can inspect the internal IP header while this datagram  is transported.  For this
reason, the IP datagram can be transported  to the external network,  through  a conceptual  tunnel, using
tunnel mode.
ESP in tunnel mode encrypts  all internal IP datagrams,  including  the internal IP header, and authentication
is optional.  AH in tunnel mode authenticates  all internal IP datagrams  and selected  parts of  the external IP
header.

+ Security  Association  (SA)
To establish  secure communication  with the other party, using IPSec, authentication  and encryption
algorithms  to be used by two communication  entities,  as well as encryption  keys, are needed.  The security
algorithm  and key information  should be exchanged  and saved before full-scale  communication,  and the
records  of this information  are called SA. Since there are many SAs in one system,  SAs are identified  by the
security  parameter  index (SPI), which is given randomly,  and a destination  IP address. Since one SA is needed

for secure communication  in one direction,  two SAs are needed for two communication  entities in order to
establish  two-way  communication.

B) SSL
@ Concept
SSL is a protocol developed  by Netscape’s  Hickman in 1994 and standardized  by the Internet  Engineering
Task Force (IETF) after the SSL version 3.0 and named as TLS (Transport  Layer Security).  Most web browsers
support  SSL. The SSLprotocol  is positioned  between  the application  layer and the transport  layer in the TCP/
IP protocol  structure.  The protocol  is designed  to use TCP to provide  reliable end-to-end  secure services.  Even
though SSL can be us'ed in various application  layer protocols,  it is actually...
