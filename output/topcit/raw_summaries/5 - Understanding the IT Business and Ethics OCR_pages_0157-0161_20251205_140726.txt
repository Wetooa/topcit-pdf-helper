*   **V2N (Vehicle-to-Network) Service:**
    *   **Definition:** Vehicles communicate with a server or mobile device via a network (cloud or Internet).
    *   **How it Works:**
        *   A **TCU** (Telecommunication Control Unit) in the vehicle communicates with a back-end server.
        *   The server then communicates with mobile devices to provide user information and control the vehicle.

#### 1.2. Connected Car Service

*   **Definition:** A core technology for self-driving cars, built on advances in telematics, mobile communication, and cloud services.
*   **Functionality:** Allows cars to connect with other cars, surroundings, and infrastructure.

The V2V service is a service in which vehicles,  the main agents of the traffic system, exchange  information  via
wireless  communication  with their surrounding  vehicles.  The service allows vehicles  to send/receive  messages  about
their positions,  traffic flow information,  and road traffic information.  Major V2V services  include roadside  information
and obstacle  notification  services,  road construction  notification  services,  intersection  traffic signal notification
services,  nearby  vehicle  information  notification  services,  and emergency  vehicle  access  notification  services.

information  received  from a multitude  of vehicles  and base stations,  and then sends information  about the traffic,
road traffic conditions,  and others to the base stations,  and the base stations  will relay them to vehicles.  Examples
of V2I services  include real-time  traffic information  collection  and provision services,  toll collection  service, roadside
information  and obstacle  notification  service, and road construction  notification  service and protected  zone

+ Connected  car service
Connected  car is a core technology  of self-driving  cars whose development  has been driven by advances  made in
telematics  technology  made possible  by the development  of mobile communication  and cloud services.  Connected
cars can provide  services  like transportation  information  services,  music services  in cars, and information  services  to
car riders based on their connectivity  to other cars, surroundings,  and infrastructure.
Examples  of services  that connected  cars can provide include information  services  using augmented  reality, services
that help drivers by recognizing  and notifying  them about road conditions  ahead, and fully autonomous  driving and
automatic  parking  that do not require  any driver response.

Among  the social changes  brought  about by advanced  digital environment,  the changes  that could affect the
education  environment  are the increased  number  of couples  who decide to live together  without  tying the knot,
the continuously  declining  birth rate, the arrival of an age when individual  choices  are respected,  and the rapid aging
of the population.  To respond  to these societal changes,  the government  established  a national strategy  on smart
education  along with a basic plan on informatization  of education  in the country.
