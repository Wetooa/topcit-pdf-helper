# Information System Architecture & Sizing Guide

## 1. Core System Architecture Components

Information systems rely on several key components working together.

### 1.1 Web Application Server (WAS)
*   **Purpose:** Middleware for stable processing of web client requests and developing distributed systems. It acts as an engine for database queries and business logic.
*   **Functions:** Supports component development, application development, web services, distributed objects, security, and integration with legacy systems.
*   **Examples:** Tomcat, Jetty, JEUS, JBoss, WebLogic, WebSphere, Node.js.

### 1.2 Transaction Processing (TP) Monitor
*   **Purpose:** Middleware for managing distributed transactions. It monitors transactions (minimum processing units between active sessions and systems) to maintain consistency across various protocols.
*   **Standard:** Most products comply with the DTP (Distributed Transaction Process) model by X/Open.
*   **Examples:** Tmax, Tuxedo.

### 1.3 DB Server (Database Management System - DBMS)
*   **Purpose:** Provides technology and a query language for accessing and modifying structured data. It's a large-scale, consolidated data storage with minimal duplication, accessible concurrently by multiple users.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Data Independence:** Separates application programs from data storage details.
    *   **Efficient Access:** Allows quick data retrieval through queries.
    *   **System Catalog:** A system table used by database administrators (DBAs) that lists definitions of all data objects stored in the database.
*   **Examples:** Oracle, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Cubrid.

## 2. Information System Capacity Calculation (Sizing)

Sizing is crucial for planning system resources.

### 2.1 Challenges in Sizing
*   **Inaccurate Calculations:** Often based on experience, leading to incorrect hardware estimates.
*   **Business-Specific Needs:** Hardware size depends on business nature, load increase, and user frequency, making it hard to determine appropriateness.
*   **Low Interest:** Despite hardware being a large part of total project costs, sizing often receives less attention than software development.
*   **No Correction Mechanism:** Difficult to correct over/underestimated hardware components once set by contractors or suppliers.

### 2.2 Concept of Sizing
*   **Definition:** Estimating or calculating a system's size using mathematical methods, based on actual work and applications.
*   **Relation to Capacity Planning:** Sizing is a lower-level, temporary concept within broader capacity planning/management.
*   **Nature:** Predictive, often called "size estimation."
*   **Goal:** Determine performance requirements and performance based on system architecture and application work.

### 2.3 Hardware Size Calculation Methods
To ensure accuracy, applying the right method is important.
*   **1. Mathematical Calculation Method**
    *   **Concept:** Calculates capacity based on sizing factors (e.g., number of users) and applies a correction factor.
    *   **Strength:** Clear basis for sizing, simpler calculation.
    *   **Weakness:** Inaccurate correction factors lead to incorrect results; difficult to provide evidence for correction factors.
*   **2. Reference Method**
    *   **Concept:** Estimates size by comparing approximate values from existing business systems with similar workloads (e.g., number of users, DB size).
    *   **Strength:** Relatively safe calculation, comparable to existing systems.
    *   **Weakness:** Weak evidence as it's comparative, not a direct calculation.
*   **3. Simulation Method**
    *   **Concept:** Models the workload for the target job and simulates it to calculate size.
    *   **Strength:** Relatively accurate values.
    *   **Weakness:** Requires significant time and cost.

## 3. Targets for Size Calculation

Sizing generally targets hardware, specifically servers, and focuses on key components.

### 3.1 Hardware Sizing Areas
*   **Servers:** PCs or peripherals are excluded; focus is on server hardware.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **CPU:** Calculates CPU size needed to process tasks; selects server model with adequate performance.
    *   **Memory:** Calculates memory usage by system software and applications for each server, based on CPU size and server configuration.
    *   **Disk:** Calculates disk usage by OS, system software, database, and database archives/backups for each server, based on CPU size and server configuration.
    *   **Storage:** Calculates external storage size needed, based on server size and CPU.

### 3.2 Performance Standards for Sizing
Different metrics are used depending on the system type and component.
*   **CPU:**
    *   **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) / OLTP & Batch:** tpmC (transactions per minute C)
    *   **Webserver:** SPECWeb2009
    *   **WAS (Application Server):** SPECjbb2005
*   **Storage:** IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), SPC-1

## 4. Reference Architecture for Size Calculation

Understanding the system's conceptual model is crucial for accurate sizing. Most information systems use a 3-tier architecture.

### 4.1 3-Tier Architecture
Divides an application into three logical and physical computing tiers.
*   **1. Presentation Layer:**
    *   User input collection.
    *   Standard interface.
    *   Access to business services.
*   **2. Business Logic Layer:**
    *   Includes data processing rules.
    *   Defines application business logic.
    *   Maps business functions to actions on business objects.
*   **3. Data Service Layer:**
    *   Data storage.
    *   Prevention of data mismatching errors.
    *   Access to mainframe databases.

### 4.2 Reference Models for 3-Tier Physical Server Configuration
Government standards suggest three models for physical server arrangement:
*   **Reference Model 1 (Layer 1):**
    *   **Configuration:** Web, application (WAS), and database layers all physically reside on a **single server**.
    *   `[WEB / WAS / DB] <-> Internet Network <-> User`
*   **Reference Model 2 (Layer 2):**
    *   **Configuration:** Web and application (WAS) layers are on **one server**, while the database layer is on a **separate DB server** (two servers total).
    *   `[WEB / WAS] <-> Internet Network <-> [DB server]`
*   **Reference Model 3 (Layer 3):**
    *   **Configuration:** Web, application (WAS), and database layers each reside on **separate servers** (three servers total).
    *   `[Web server] <-> [Application Server] <-> [Database Server]`

## 5. Size Calculation Procedure (High-Level)

The general procedure for sizing involves:
1.  **Reference Data Investigation:** Gather existing data and information.
2.  **Task Analysis:** Understand the specific tasks and workloads.
3.  **Application of Reference Model:** Select and apply the appropriate reference architecture model (e.g., 3-tier model).
4.  **Direction & Basic Data/Weight Factor for Each Reference Model:** Define specific parameters and weighting factors based on the chosen model.

02 Information  System  Capacity  Calculation
When implementing  an information  system,  many hardware  suppliers  or system integrators  use the items and rates
for sizing calculation,  based on their experience,  leading  to inaccurately  calculated  sizes.
Moreover,  since the hardware  size must be calculated  according  to the nature of the business,  load increase  rate, and
use frequency  by the users, it is difficult to determine  the appropriateness  of the hardware  size in the information
system  implementation  projects.
For that reason, hardware  sizing has usually been dependent  on the project contractor  or hardware  supplier. It has
gained relatively  low interest,  compared  to software  development,  although  the share of hardware  in the information
system  implementation  project  is very large in the total project  cost. Therefore,  there is no way to correct  it, even if a

hardware  component  is over or underestimated  by a project  contractor  or a hardware  supplier.
As such, this chapter  reflects  the government  guidelines  for calculating  hardware  size.
A) Concept  of size calculation
System sizing is to estimate  or calculate  a system’s  size using a mathematical  methodology,  based on actual
work and applications.  It can be defined as a lower-level  concept  of capacity  planning  or capacity  management  to
determine  performance  requirements  and performance  based on the system architecture  application,  as shown in
[Figure 81]. Sizing is temporarily  performed  for a specific  system  or server, and it is also called size estimation  because
it has a predictive  nature.

Sizing is a matter of prediction,  and the calculation  method significantly  affects the accuracy  of the calculation.
Hardware  size calculation  methods  are generally  classified  into the mathematical  calculation,  reference,  and simulation
methods,  as shown in [Figure 82]. It is necessary  to apply an appropriate  sizing method  to get accurate  sizing. This
guideline  uses a mathematical  calculation  method.  However,  it is necessary  to use all three methods  appropriately  for
size calculation,  in order to increase  the accuracy  of the calculation  results and objectivity.
