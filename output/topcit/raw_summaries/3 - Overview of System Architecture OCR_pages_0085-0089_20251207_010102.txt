## Learning Guide: Storage Systems and Management

### 1. Introduction to Data Storage Systems

*   **Need:** Modern multimedia services require storing increasing volumes of data.
*   **Solution:** Large-capacity storage systems group multiple disks to handle data beyond a single disk's capacity.
*   **Classification:** Storage systems are classified based on their connection method to a computer:
    *   Direct Attached Storage (DAS)
    *   Network Attached Storage (NAS)
    *   Storage Area Network (SAN)

### 2. Types of Storage Connection

#### A. Direct Attached Storage (DAS)

*   **Connection:** Directly connects disks to a single computer system via cables (e.g., Fiber Channel, SCSI).
*   **Management:** The computer system manages the file system directory.
*   **Analogy:** Works like an external hard disk.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Simple configuration.
    *   Low cost (no separate switch needed).
    *   High speed (direct connection).
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Limited number of disks can be connected.
    *   Files cannot be shared with other computers (single point of connection).

#### B. Network Attached Storage (NAS)

*   **Connection:** Connects to computer systems over a network (e.g., LAN, WAN) using an Ethernet network interface.
*   **Key Feature:** Has a separate dedicated file system management server (controller).
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Easier data management due to the dedicated server.
    *   Multiple servers and computer systems on the same network can share and use the storage, regardless of physical location.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Speed and capacity are limited by the network speed.

#### C. Storage Area Network (SAN)

*   **Purpose:** Developed to overcome limitations of DAS (disk limit, management) and NAS (network speed delay).
*   **Connection:** Uses a **dedicated fiber channel switch** for fast connections.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   High speed (8Gbps - 16Gbps possible with Fiber Channel).
    *   Scalability for connecting more servers and storage units.
    *   Less impact on the general network load.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Very fast data access.
    *   Highly scalable.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   High cost (requires dedicated switch and expensive cables).
    *   Can lead to consistency problems (locking issues) when multiple systems share a specific file.

### 3. IP-SAN: Network-Based SAN

*   **Concept:** A type of SAN that uses the existing **Gigabit Ethernet Internet Protocol (IP)** instead of a dedicated fiber channel.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Increases interconnectivity by using existing Ethernet networks.
    *   Unifies network management.
    *   Overcomes distance limitations of traditional SANs (due to IP's reach).
*   **Main Types:** FCIP, iFCP, and iSCSI (iSCSI is the most widely used).

#### A. Fiber Channel over IP (FCIP)

*   **Purpose:** Connects remote SANs.
*   **How it Works:** Encapsulates Fiber Channel data into TCP/IP packets for transfer over an IP network.
*   **Function:** Groups geographically scattered SANs into a large "fiber channel fabric."
*   **Disadvantage:** A failure in one SAN within the fabric can affect other SANs in different regions.

#### B. Internet Fiber Channel Protocol (iFCP)

*   **How it Works:** Provides a dedicated TCP/IP connection to regional SANs using an **iFCP gateway**.
*   **Key Difference from FCIP:** Does not create a massive fabric, so a SAN failure in one region does not affect SANs in other regions.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   High compatibility (hardware and software).
    *   Can be implemented without changing existing infrastructure (by converting protocols via a gateway).

#### C. Internet SCSI (iSCSI)

*   **How it Works:** Encapsulates **SCSI commands** (commands for interacting with storage devices) into IP packets and transfers this block data over TCP/IP.
*   **Reliability:** Uses technologies like IPSec to ensure data integrity.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Reduces network storage implementation cost (uses existing network environment).
    *   Most widely used IP-SAN type.

### 4. Storage Capacity Management

#### A. Thin Provisioning

*   **Problem:** Traditional "thick logical unit number (LUN)" allocation wastes storage space by pre-allocating more than what's immediately needed.
*   **Solution:** A storage virtualization technology that allocates data by mapping actual storage space only when data is written, using a "thin LUN."
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Flexibly expands disk space as needed by users (common in cloud computing).
    *   Offers a higher data utilization rate compared to conventional thick LUNs.

#### B. Data De-duplication

*   **Purpose:** Increases disk space efficiency by identifying and removing redundant (duplicated) data when saving it.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Inline Method:** Removes redundant data immediately as it enters the storage system.
    *   **Offline Method:** Stores all new data first, then identifies and removes redundant data later.

### 5. Storage Disk Scheduling & Performance

#### A. Disk Scheduling

*   **Concept:** A technique to efficiently process multiple Input/Output (I/O) requests made to a disk drive (which uses a rotating magnetic disk). The order of processing requests and head movement significantly impacts performance.
*   **Goals/Purposes:**
    *   Maximize the number of I/O requests serviced per unit time.
    *   Maximize throughput (data processed per unit time).
    *   Minimize the average response time for requests.
    *   Minimize the overall response time.
    *   Minimize the variation (inconsistency) of response times.

#### B. Disk Performance Measurement Indicators

*   These indicators are used to compare different disk scheduling techniques.
*   **Key Indicators:**
    *   **Access Time:** Total time to read or write data.
    *   **Seeking Time (Seek Time):** The time it takes for the disk's read/write head to move from its current position to the track containing the desired data.
    *   **Rotational Latency (Rotational Delay):** The time it takes for the desired sector (containing the data) to rotate under the read/write head after the head has reached the correct track.
    *   **Data Transfer Time:** The time taken to actually transfer the data once the head is positioned correctly over the desired sector.
*   **Note:** Recent disk drives use internal buffers and store all data in a track to minimize rotational latency.

B) Connection  of storage  unit and server
Multimedia  services,  using a large volume of data, led to computer  systems  storing an increased  volume of data. A
large-capacity  storage  system is necessary,  since a single disk cannot  support  the increasing  data capacity.  A storage
system logically  groups multiple  disks in order to store large capacity  data that a single disk cannot handle. It is
classified  into DAS, NAS, and SAN, depending  on how it is connected  to the computer.
@ Direct attached  storage  (DAS)
The storage  connects  a computer  system with disks directly  through  a fiber channel  or SCSI cable in order to utilize
the storage  capacity.  It allows the computer  system to manage  the file system directory.  Since the storage is
directly  connected  to the computer  system, it works like an external hard disk at high speed. Its advantage  is that
its configuration  is simple, and the cost is low without  a separate  switch, but there is a limitation  in the number  of
disks that can be connected.  Moreover,  files in the storage  cannot  be shared with other computers,  since it is directly
connected  to a computer.

@ Network  attached  storage  (NAS)
The storage has a separate  file system management  server (controller)  to manage  the storage  media such as HDD
and SSD. It is connected  to a computer  system  through  an Ethernet  network  interface  like LAN or WAN. Since it has
a separate  file system management  server, it is easier to manage  data, and multiple  servers  can share the storage.
Moreover,  multiple computer  systems  on the same network  can use the storage,  regardless  of the physical  location.
As the storage  is connected  over a network,  its speed and capacity  are limited by the network  speed.

A disadvantage  of the DAS type is the limitation  of the number  of disks, and the difficulty  of management,  while
the NAS type has a problem  of possible  speed delay, depending  on the network  connection.  SAN was developed  to
overcome  the disadvantages. It uses a dedicated  fiber channel switch for fast connection,  and it enabled  the ability
to scale up the number  of connected  servers and storage,  with less impact to the connected  network  load. Using
the fiber channel  allows the connection  to speed up to 8Gbps - 16Gbps.  However,  it increases  costs since it requires
the dedicated  switch and expensive  cables, and it can cause a consistency  problem,  due to locking, when multiple
computer  systems  share a specific  file.

C) IP-SAN
@ Concept  of IP-SAN
This type of SAN uses the gigabit  Ethernet  Internet  protocol  (IP), instead of a fiber channel.  While the SAN requires
a SAN switch and SAN storage  disks, it increases  interconnectivity,  since it is connected  using the existing  Ethemet
network.  It can unify the network  management  and overcome  the distance  limitation  of SAN, since it can use an IP
IP-SAN  includes  FCIP, iFCP, and iSCSI, while iSCSI is the most widely-used  type.
@ Fiber Channel  over IP (FCIP)
FCIP is used to connect  a remote  SAN. It encapsulates  data to TCP/IP  for interconnection  when transferring  a frame
to a remote location.  It groups the scattered  SANs into a massive  fiber channel  fabric. A failure of a SAN can affect
SANs in other regions  included  in the fabric.

© Internet  fiber channel  protocol  (iFCP)
iFCP provides  a TCP/IP connection  dedicated  to regional  SAN, using the iFCP gateway.  Unlike FCIP a SAN failure does
not affect SAN in other regions,  since it does not create a massive  fabric. Since it converts  protocols  using a gateway
and can be implemented  without  changing  the infrastructure,  it provides  highly compatible  interconnectivity  in both
hardware  and software.

@ Internet  SCSI (iSCSI)
iSCSI encapsulates  SCSI commands  into IP packets  and transfer  the I/O block data through  TCP/IP. Technologies  like
IPSec ensure reliability.  It reduces  the network  storage implementation  cost, since it can use the existing  network
environment  as is.
