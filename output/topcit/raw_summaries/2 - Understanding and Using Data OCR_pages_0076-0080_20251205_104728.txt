## Database Learning Guide: Normalization (4NF, 5NF) & Denormalization

### 1. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

**Purpose:** To eliminate **multi-valued dependencies (MVDs)** and prevent associated anomalies.

**Anomalies Prevented (even without 4NF):**
*   **Input Error:** Entering redundant data for independent multi-valued attributes (e.g., re-entering a technology code for an employee supporting multiple projects).
*   **Modification Error:** Changing data in multiple places when an independent multi-valued attribute is updated (e.g., changing a project code means updating all related technology entries for that employee).
*   **Deletion Error:** Deleting one piece of information unintentionally removes other, unrelated information (e.g., deleting an employee's technology might also delete their project assignment history).

**How to Perform 4NF:**
1.  Identify tables where independent multi-valued attributes exist within the same table.
2.  Decompose (split) the original table into new tables where each multi-valued dependency is represented in its own relation.
3.  **Example Scenario:**
    *   **Original problem:** An `Employee` has multiple `Holding Skills` and supports multiple `Projects`. `Holding Skills` and `Support Project` are independent multi-valued facts about an employee.
    *   **Relationships:**
        *   Employee supports a project (Employee ↔ Project)
        *   Employee has a certain technology (Employee ↔ Technology)
        *   **Crucially:** The technology used in a project is *not* directly tied to this specific employee's skill set or project support; these are independent facts about the employee.
    *   **4NF Solution:**
        *   Create an `Employee` table (Employee ID, Employee Name, Address).
        *   Create an `Employee_Skills` table (Employee ID (FK), Technology Code (FK)).
        *   Create an `Employee_Projects` table (Employee ID (FK), Project Code (FK)).
        *   Create `Skill` table (Skill Code, Skill Name) and `Project` table (Project Code, Project Name) as needed.

### 2. Fifth Normal Form (5NF) / Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)

**Concept:** A relation `R` is in 5NF if all **join dependencies** that exist in `R` can be satisfied by the candidate key(s) of `R`. This means `R` cannot be decomposed into smaller tables without losing information, where rejoining those smaller tables would yield the exact original table (no "spurious tuples").

**Characteristics:**
*   Normalization occurs based on the **primary key**.
*   There are **join relationships between independent attributes** (e.g., A-B, A-C, B-C).
*   The table is created by being **separated into associative relations**.
*   It often applies when three or more attributes (A, B, C) have semantic relationships (A-B, A-C, B-C) but **no direct three-way relationship (A-B-C)** exists or is implied.

**Anomalies Prevented (even without 5NF):**
*   **Input Error:** Cannot input a new A-B association without considering/knowing A-C and B-C associations.
*   **Modification Error:** Modifying an A-B association requires changing multiple records due to A-C and B-C associations.
*   **Deletion Error:** Deleting an A-B association unintentionally deletes A-C and B-C association information.

**How to Perform 5NF:**
1.  Identify a table with three or more primary key attributes where there are direct binary (two-way) relationships between them, but no direct semantic multi-way relationship for all attributes together.
2.  Decompose the table into separate tables, each representing one of the binary or ternary relationships that truly exists.
3.  **Example Scenario:**
    *   **Attributes:** Supplier (S), Part (P), Project (PN).
    *   **Relationships:**
        *   A supplier supplies a certain part (S ↔ P).
        *   A supplier has supported a certain project (S ↔ PN).
        *   A certain part has been used for a certain project (P ↔ PN).
        *   **Crucially:** There is **no direct association** about *how* a specific supplier used a specific part for a specific project (S-P-PN). The three relationships are independent.
    *   **Original problem:** Storing all S, P, PN in a single table without this direct S-P-PN relationship leads to redundancy and anomalies.
    *   **5NF Solution:**
        *   Decompose the single table into three separate tables, each representing one of the existing two-way relationships:
            *   `Supplier_Part` table (Supplier ID (PK), Part ID (PK))
            *   `Supplier_Project` table (Supplier ID (PK), Project ID (PK))
            *   `Part_Project` table (Part ID (PK), Project ID (PK))
        *   This ensures that no information is lost when rejoining, and anomalies are prevented.

### 3. Denormalization

**Definition:** The process of intentionally introducing redundancy or combining normalized data models (entities, attributes, relationships) to **improve system performance** and **simplify development/operations**.

**Considerations:**
*   Always prioritize **data consistency and integrity** over performance. Denormalization should be a calculated choice after normalization.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Investigate Denormalization Targets (When to consider it):**
    *   **Frequent Range Processing:** Many processes access frequently used tables, and always search within a specific range.
    *   **Wide Range Processing:** Large tables are frequently accessed across a wide data range, and performance is poor without reducing the processing range.
    *   **Statistical Processes:** Statistical information is often required, leading to the creation of a separate statistics table.
    *   **Too Many Table Joins:** Querying becomes technically difficult or slow due to an excessive number of joins.

2.  **Consider Inducing Other Methods (Alternatives to Denormalization):**
    *   **View Creation:** Use views to simplify complex queries involving many joins without changing the underlying data structure.
    *   **Clustering Application:** Reorganize physical data storage based on a specific clustering key to improve query performance (suitable for query-oriented tables).
    *   **Index Adjustment:** Optimize indexes to ensure sufficient performance without denormalization.
    *   **Application Development:** Improve performance by changing the logic applied within the application itself.

3.  **Apply Denormalization (If other methods are insufficient):**
    *   **Table Denormalization:** Merging or splitting tables.
    *   **Attribute Denormalization:** Adding redundant attributes.
    *   **Relationship Denormalization:** Modifying relationships to reduce joins.

**Actual Denormalization Techniques:**

1.  **Table Denormalization:**
    *   **Merging Tables:**
        *   **Purpose:** Improve performance when there are many join operations.
        *   **When to merge:**
            *   1:1 relationship tables.
            *   1:M relationship tables (if the "many" side is frequently accessed with the "one" side).
            *   Super/sub-type relationship tables.
    *   **Splitting Tables:**
        *   **Purpose:** Reduce lockup and contention, and improve performance when only specific attributes are accessed frequently.
        *   **Caution:** Performance might degrade for full table searches due to needing union operations.
        *   **Types of Splitting:**
            *   **Vertical Split:** Splitting columns when only specific attributes are frequently accessed together.
                *   *Example:* A `Payment` table with many columns could be split into `Payment_Basic_Info` (frequently accessed) and `Payment_Audit_Info` (less frequently accessed).
            *   **Horizontal Split:** Splitting rows when the schema is the same, but data values are used differently for different rows (e.g., querying history by year).
                *   *Example:* A `Payment History` table could be split into `Payment_History_January`, `Payment_History_February`, etc., to allow faster access to monthly data.

Normalization)
A) Concept  of the fifth normalization
+ If all join dependencies  that exist in relation R can be satisfied  by the candidate  key of relation R, relation  R is called
the fifth normal  form.
B) Characteristics  of the fifth normalization
@® Normalization  occurs in the primary  key.
@ There should be a join relationship  between  independent  attributes.
© Created  after being separated  into associative  relations.
@ When there are three attributes,  A, B, and C, there is a semantic  relationship  as follows. However,  an anomaly  occurs
when creating  a table using these attributes.
+ Relationship  between  A and B: A and  B are related.
+ Relationship  between  A and C: A and C are related.
+ Relationship  between  C and B: C and B are related.
+ Relationship  between  A, B, and C: There is no relationship  in which A, B, and C are all related.
C) Performing  the fifth normalization
@ When there is an attribute  that has the primary  of SN, CM, and PN, it can be created  as a table, as follows.
+ SN: ID of the supplier  (PK)
+ CN: ID of the part (PK)
+ PN: ID of the project  (PK)
@ The association  preconditions  of each identifier  are as follows.
+ A supplier  has an association  in which a certain part is supplied.  (A and  B are related.)
+ There is an association  in which the supplier  has supported  a certain project.  (A and C are related.)
+ There is an association  in which a certain part has been used for a certain project.  (B and C are related.)
+ However,  there is no association  about how a certain supplier  has used a certain part for a certain project.  (A, B, and
C are not related.)
+ Despite  the above constraints,  it is designed  as a single table, as follows.
+ If it is designed  as a single table despite  these preconditions,  input error, modification  error, and deletion  error can
occur even without  performing  the fifth normalization.

<Table 30> Classification  of anomalies
Type Anomaly
If a supplier  wants to input new association  information  for a part, the supplier  should consider  the association
between  the supplier  and project  and the association  between  the part and project.
Modification  | To modify  the association  information  for a supplier  and a part, multiple  records  should be modified  because
error other associations  should also be considered.
If the association  information  for a supplier  and a part is deleted,  the association  information  for a supplier  and
a project, as well as the association  information  for a part and a project,  are also deleted.
