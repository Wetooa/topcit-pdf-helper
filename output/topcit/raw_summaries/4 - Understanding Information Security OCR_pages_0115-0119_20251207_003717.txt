## **Information Security Learning Guide: TCP/IP & Network Attacks**

### **1. TCP/IP Protocol Suite Overview**

The TCP/IP model simplifies the OSI model's 7 layers into 4 layers, focusing on internet communication.

*   **Application Layer:**
    *   **OSI Equivalent:** Application, Presentation, Session layers.
    *   **Function:** Manages high-level communication, data formatting, and session control.
    *   **Protocols:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP.
*   **Transport Layer (Host-to-Host Transport Layer):**
    *   **OSI Equivalent:** Transport layer.
    *   **Function:** Manages data exchange between virtual ports for applications. Ensures reliable data transfer.
    *   **Protocols:** TCP, UDP, SCTP, IGMP, ICMP, ND, MLD.
*   **Internet Layer (Network Layer):**
    *   **OSI Equivalent:** Network layer.
    *   **Function:** Manages addressing (IP addresses) and routing of data packets across networks.
    *   **Protocols:** IP (IPv4), IPv6, ARP, ICMPv6.
*   **Network Interface Layer (Network Access Layer):**
    *   **OSI Equivalent:** Data Link & Physical layers.
    *   **Function:** Physically transfers TCP/IP packets over media like Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Handles MAC addressing and physical signals.
    *   **Protocols:** 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi.

### **2. Security Functions by TCP/IP Layer**

Initially, TCP/IP was designed for free information exchange, not security. Security protocols were added later as the internet evolved.

*   **Application Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **PGP & S/MIME:** Provide email security (encryption, digital signatures).
    *   **Kerberos:** Provides strong authentication services.
    *   **SSH (Secure Shell):** Supports secure remote access.
*   **Transport Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **SSL (Secure Socket Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security):**
        *   Acts above the Transport Layer.
        *   Provides secure, end-to-end communication and data integrity for application data.
        *   TLS is the IETF standard successor to SSL.
*   **Internet Layer Security Protocols:**
    *   **IPSec (IP Security):**
        *   Acts above the Internet Layer.
        *   Provides authentication and encryption at the IP packet level.
        *   Used to implement VPN services.

### **3. Types of Network Attacks and Countermeasures**

#### **A. DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks**

**Goal:** Disturb normal server operation by overloading it, impacting **availability**.

*   **Land Attack:**
    *   **What it is:** Sends a packet where the source and destination IP addresses are identical to the target's IP. This causes the target host to enter an infinite loop trying to send/receive the packet, crashing or stalling the system.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Block incoming packets where the source IP address matches the server's own IP address using routers or packet filtering.
*   **Ping of Death Attack:**
    *   **What it is:** Sends an ICMP (Ping) packet larger than the normal allowed size. When fragmented and reassembled, it causes system overload or crash.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Block ICMP protocols using firewalls or other network devices.
*   **SYN Flooding Attack:**
    *   **What it is:** Exploits the TCP 3-way handshake vulnerability. The attacker sends many SYN requests but doesn't complete the handshake, leaving many "half-open" connections. This exhausts the server's connection table, preventing legitimate connections.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Reduce the waiting time for SYN reception status; install an intrusion prevention system (IPS).
*   **Boink Attack:**
    *   **What it is:** A DoS attack that manipulates sequence numbers in packets (e.g., sending abnormal, out-of-order sequence numbers repeatedly). This forces the target system to perform excessive processing to reassemble and combine packets, causing overload.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Similar to Ping of Death or SYN Flooding (e.g., traffic filtering, intrusion prevention).
*   **DDoS (Distributed DoS) Attack:**
    *   **What it is:** An evolved DoS attack that uses **multiple** attack sources (often compromised "zombie" computers) to launch a coordinated attack, making it harder to block.

#### **B. Sniffing Attack (Eavesdropping)**

**Goal:** Eavesdrop on network traffic; also known as a **passive attack**.

*   **How it works:**
    *   On shared LANs, computers can technically see all traffic.
    *   Network interface cards (NICs) have a filtering function to ignore frames not addressed to their MAC address.
    *   **Promiscuous Mode:** Attackers set their NICs to "promiscuous mode" to bypass this filter and capture *all* traffic on the LAN segment.
*   **Sniffing with Switches:**
    *   Switches send traffic only to the intended destination. To sniff on a switched network, attackers use techniques like:
        *   Switch jamming
        *   ARP redirect (ARP spoofing)
        *   ICMP redirect
        *   MAC spoofing
*   **Detection:** Periodically check if hosts on the network are operating in promiscuous mode (e.g., using Ping, ARP, DNS, or induction methods).

#### **C. Spoofing Attack (Disguising Identity)**

**Goal:** Disguise identification information (IP, MAC, hostname, etc.) to deceive systems, often to facilitate other attacks.

*   **ARP Spoofing:**
    *   **What it is:** The attacker sends fake ARP messages to map their own MAC address to another device's (e.g., gateway or server) IP address, or vice versa. This reroutes traffic through the attacker's machine.
    *   **Mechanism:** Attacker tells client "Server's MAC is CC (attacker's MAC)" and tells server "Client's MAC is CC (attacker's MAC)." Both client and server then send packets to the attacker, allowing them to read and forward traffic (Man-in-the-Middle).
    *   **Countermeasure:** Manually set static ARP table entries to prevent dynamic changes. This needs to be done after every system reboot.
*   **IP Spoofing:**
    *   **What it is:** An attacker changes their IP address to mimic a trusted host. This is often used to exploit "trust authentication" systems that grant access based solely on IP address without a password.
    *   **Countermeasure:** Avoid using trust authentication unless absolutely necessary. Rely on stronger authentication methods.
*   **DNS Spoofing:**
    *   **What it is:** An attacker takes control of a DNS server or intercepts DNS requests. They then provide a fake IP address for a legitimate domain, redirecting users to an attacker-controlled system instead of the intended one.
    *   **Mechanism:** User requests address for "example.com" -> attacker intercepts -> attacker returns IP address of their malicious site.
    *   **Countermeasure:** For critical servers, register their IP addresses directly in the host file to bypass DNS queries. (Realistically, this is impractical for all servers).

### **4. Security Protocols and Solutions: IPSec**

#### **A. IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)**

*   **Concept:**
    *   **Purpose:** Developed to address security vulnerabilities in IPv4 (lack of authentication, susceptibility to eavesdropping/packet alteration).
    *   **Function:** Provides security services (encryption, authentication, key management) directly to IP packets, securing all applications running over IP.
    *   **Mandatory for IPv6:** It's an optional feature in IPv4 but a basic, fundamental function in IPv6.
*   **Composition & Operation:**
    *   IPSec operates at the IP layer, transparently to end-user applications.
    *   It's typically implemented on network devices like routers or firewalls at the edge of a network (e.g., for traffic leaving a LAN) to ensure secure communication between networks.

transport  layer. The concept  of this layer includes,  not only the application  layer, but also the presentation
layer and the session  layer of the OSI reference  model.
+ Transport  layer: Also known as the host-to-host  transport  layer. This layer manages  data exchange  between
virtual ports that are managed  by the application  program,  such as the TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocol.  This:
layer corresponds  to the transport  layer of the OSI reference  model.
+ Internet  layer: Also known as the network  layer, this layer manages  the addressing  and routing  functions,  and
it corresponds  to the network  layer of the OSI reference  model.
The network  interface  layer in [Figure 58] is not a concept  that is dependent  on the structure  of the TCP/
IP protocol.  It is also referred to as a network  access layer. The network  interface  layer is randomly  selected
by the network  interface  layer and practically  transfers  TCP/IP packets  through a physical medium,  such as
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet  or IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi. This layer includes  the functions  of both the data link layer, which
manages  the MAC function  of the OSI 7-layer reference  model, and the physical layer that defines electrical
signals.

Since the purpose  of designing  the TCP/IP protocol structure  lies in free information  exchange,  the concept
of security  is not considered  in the design process.  As TCP/IP is used as the core protocol  of the Internet,
and the application,  like e-Commerce,  is developed  or used, protocols  with security  functions  are added to

reference  model.
+ Security  protocols  related to the application  layer
There are various  security  protocols  related to the application  layer, such as PGP and S/MIME that provide
e-mail security  function,  Kerberos  that provides  authentication  functions,  and SSH (secure shell) that
supports  secure  remote  access,  etc.
+ Security  protocols  related  to the transport  layer
SSL (Secure Socket Layer)/TLS (Transport  Layer Security)  is a protocol  that acts above the transport  layer,
which provides  the secure transport  layer services to the application  layer. TLS is the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) standard  for SSL, and it provides  end-to-end  security  and data integrity.
+ Security  protocols  related  to the Internet
The IPSec (IP Security)  protocol  that acts above the Internet  layer, which provides  security  features,  such as
authentication  and encryption,  to the Internet  layer. This protocol  is used to implement  VPN services.

C) Types of network  attacks  and countermeasures
@ DoS attack
The DoS attack disturbs  the normal operation  of a specific server by causing  various types of load. It is an
attack on availability,  one of the security services.  Typical DoS attacks include land attacks, ping of death
attacks,  Syn flooding  attacks,  and Boink attacks.
+ Land attack
An attack that sends a packet  to the target, by making  the IP address  of the source and destination  identical
to the attacker's  IP address.  Server  operation  fails, due to serious  failure in the IP protocol  stack because  the
host that receives  the packet  falls into an infinite loop of receiving  and sending  the packet.
This attack can be responded  to by blocking  packets  whose source IP address  is the same as the server's  IP
address,  among  the packets  flowing  into the network,  using a router or packet  filtering  tool.
+ Ping of death attack
When an attacker  makes an ICMP packet that much larger than the normal  size and sends it, the packet is
divided into many small fragments  and transmitted  to the attacking  network.  Accordingly,  the attack target

system must process  all those small packets.  As a result, it takes a lot more load than the normal Ping
command,  and the performance  of the system is degraded.
This attack can be responded  to by blocking  ICMP protocols,  which sends the Ping command,  using  a firewall
and other devices.
