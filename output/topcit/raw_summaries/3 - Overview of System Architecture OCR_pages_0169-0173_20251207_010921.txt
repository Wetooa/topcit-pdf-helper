## Networking Essentials: Protocols and Addressing

### 1. Bellman-Ford Algorithm

*   **Purpose:** Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex (`s`) to all other vertices (`u`) in a weighted graph. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Initializes distances from the source.
    *   Repeatedly "relaxes" all edges `|V| - 1` times (where `|V|` is the number of vertices).
    *   **Relaxation:** For an edge `(u,v)` with weight `w(u,v)`, if the current distance to `v` (`v.d`) is greater than the distance to `u` (`u.d`) plus the edge weight, `v.d` is updated (`v.d = u.d + w(u,v)`).
    *   **Negative Cycle Detection:** If, after `|V| - 1` iterations, an edge can still be relaxed, it indicates the presence of a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source.

### 2. Routing Protocol Classification

Routing protocols guide data packets across networks. They are classified by routing type and Autonomous System (AS).

*   **Autonomous System (AS):** A collection of IP networks and routers under the control of one or more network operators, having a single and clearly defined routing policy.

#### A. Routing Types

1.  **Static Routing:** Manual configuration of routes by an administrator.
2.  **Dynamic Routing:** Routers automatically discover and update routes using routing protocols.

#### B. Dynamic Routing Protocols (Based on AS)

1.  **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP):**
    *   Operates *within* a single Autonomous System (AS).
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Distance-Vector:** Routers exchange their entire routing tables with neighbors (e.g., RIP, IGRP).
        *   **Link-State:** Routers share information about their direct links with all other routers in the AS, building a full network topology map (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS).
        *   **Hybrid:** Combines aspects of both (e.g., EIGRP).
    *   **Common Protocols:**
        *   **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Distance-vector.
        *   **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Link-state.
        *   **IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** Cisco-proprietary distance-vector.
        *   **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** Cisco-proprietary hybrid.
        *   **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** Link-state.

2.  **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP):**
    *   Operates *between* different Autonomous Systems (ASes).
    *   **Common Protocol:**
        *   **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Uses a path-vector algorithm.

#### C. Overview of Specific Routing Protocols

| Protocol | Algorithm Type | Key Characteristics |
| :------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RIP**  | Distance-Vector| - Delivers routing table updates every 30 seconds via broadcasting. <br> - Max hop count: 15 (16 means unreachable). <br> - Does not support VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks). <br> - Does not reflect network state (bandwidth, delay). <br> - No load balancing. |
| **IGRP** | Distance-Vector| - Cisco proprietary, improves on RIP. <br> - Reflects network state (bandwidth, delay, load, reliability). <br> - Max hop count: 255. <br> - Does not support VLSM. <br> - Supports load balancing. |
| **OSPF** | Link-State     | - Information about changes (e.g., new routes, link failures) spreads quickly. <br> - All routers within an AS have the same network topology information. <br> - Supports VLSM and load balancing. <br> - Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths. |
| **BGP**  | Path-Vector    | - The primary EGP, connects different ASes (e.g., connecting ISPs). <br> - Uses TCP for reliable communication. <br> - Makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, and rules. |

### 3. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) Addresses

#### A. What is an IPv4 Address?

*   A **32-bit numerical identifier** used at the IP layer to uniquely identify devices (routers, hosts) connected to the Internet.
*   **Structure:** Divided into four 8-bit sections (octets), separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   **Components:**
    *   **IP Address:** The full unique identification for a device on the network.
    *   **Network ID:** Identifies the specific physical network the device belongs to.
    *   **Host ID:** Identifies the specific device within that network.
    *   **Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit mask that distinguishes the network ID from the host ID within an IP address.

#### B. Flexible IP Allocation

*   **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing, RFC 1519):** An IP addressing method that allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses by not restricting network parts to fixed 8-bit boundaries. It uses a `/` notation (e.g., `/24`) to indicate the number of bits in the network part.
*   **Subnetting:** Dividing a single large IP network address into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This is done by "borrowing" bits from the host ID portion for the network ID.
*   **Supernetting:** Combining multiple small network IDs into one larger network ID.

#### C. IPv4 Address Designation System (Classes)

Before CIDR, IPv4 addresses were divided into classes based on the first few bits.

*   **Network Address:** Assigned by Internet address resource management organizations.
*   **Host Address:** Assigned by network administrators to individual hosts.

| Class | Address Range               | Purpose                         | Network/Host Structure (Octets) | Default Subnet Mask |
| :---- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------ |
| **A** | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255   | Large networks                  | Network | Host | Host | Host | 255.0.0.0           |
| **B** | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | Medium-sized networks           | Network | Network | Host | Host | 255.255.0.0         |
| **C** | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | Small networks                  | Network | Network | Network | Host | 255.255.255.0       |
| **D** | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | Multicast (one-to-many communication) | -                               | -                   |
| **E** | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | Reserved for experimental/future use | -                               | -                   |

#### D. Special IPv4 Addresses

These addresses have specific functions and are not used for general host identification on the public internet.

| Address Type             | Address Pattern            | Usage                                                                 | Routable? |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| **Network Address**      | `NetworkID.0.0.0`          | Identifies the entire network.                                        | Yes       |
| **Directed Broadcast**   | `NetworkID.255.255.255`    | Sends data to all hosts on a specific network.                        | Yes       |
| **Local Loopback**       | `127.X.X.X` (commonly 127.0.0.1) | Used for internal system testing and communication within a single device. | No        |
| **Limited Broadcast**    | `255.255.255.255`          | Sends data to all hosts on the local network (within the router's scope). | No        |
| **"This Host"**          | `0.0.0.0`                  | Used by a host that doesn't know its own IP address (e.g., during DHCP request). | No        |
| **APIPA**                | `169.254.X.X`              | **Automatic Private IP Addressing:** Automatically assigned when DHCP is unavailable. | No        |
| **Private IP Addresses** |                            | Used in private networks (LANs) without requiring public registration. | No        |
| **Class A Private**      | `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`|                                                                       | No        |
| **Class B Private**      | `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`|                                                                       | No        |
| **Class C Private**      | `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`|                                                                       | No        |

C) Routing  protocol  types
The routing  protocol  is classified  into static routing  and dynamic  routing,  depending  on the routing  type, as shown in
(Figure 122]. The dynamic  routing  method is divided into the EGP (Exterior  Gateway  Protocol)  method  and the IGP
(Interior  Gateway  Protocol)  method, according  to the classification  of AS (Autonomous  System).  The IGP (Interior
Gateway  Protocol)  method  is further  divided into the distance  vector method,  the link-state  method,  and the hybrid
method,  according  to the routing  setting  method.

Overview  of System Architecture )
When classifying routing protocols,  based on AS, the routing protocol  within the AS is called the inter gateway
protocol  (IGP). The leading IGP includes  the routing information  protocol  (RIP), using a distance  vector routing
algorithm,  and the open shortest  path first (OSPF),  using a link-state  routing  algorithm.  The routing  protocol  between
AS is called the exterior  gateway  protocol  (EGP). The leading  EGP is the border  gateway  protocol  (BGP) that uses a
path-vector  routing  algorithm.
D) Routing  protocol  type
The routing protocol includes  RIP, which uses the distance-vector  routing  algorithm  and delivers  the routing  table
information  every 30 seconds  through  broadcasting,  IGRP. which improves  some of the RIP problems  by reflecting  the
network  state (bandwidth,  delay time, load, etc.), OSPF, which uses the link-state  routing  algorithm,  and BGP, which
connects  between  AS. <Table 50> shows  the details  of each protocol.

06 IPv4 Overview
A) What is an IPv4 (Internet  Protocol  Version  4) address?
The IPv4 address  is the 32-bit address  used on the IP layer, as shown in [Figure 123]. It is an identifier  that makes the
router or host connection  to the Internet  unique and universal.

The elements  of the IPv4 address  include an IP address,  which is a unique identification  address  given to all
communication  networks  that are connected  to the Internet  and computers  connected  to the network, a network
ID, which identifies  TCP/IP hosts in the same physical  network,  a host ID, which identifies  the TCP/IP host on the
network,  and the 32-bit subnet mask, which specifies  the network  name for the iP address  from the hostname.
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain  Routing,  RFC 1519) is a method  of expressing  the IPv4 address  and one of IP allocating
methods  that does not divide the network  part from the host part in 8-bit units. Moreover,  subnetting  and
supernetting  can flexibly  express  the network  and host Ips, according  to the number  of IPs required by the network,
without  dividing  the IPv4 address  and the network  ID into fixed 8-bit units. Here, subnetting  refers to dividing ...
