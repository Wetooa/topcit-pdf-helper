### 3. Understanding Data

**3.1. Data, Information, and Knowledge**

*   **Data**
    *   **Concept:** Raw, collected resources; basic facts discovered, investigated, or created in the real world.
    *   **Characteristic:** A natural state, free of human judgment.
    *   **Key Point:** Phenomenon, Factual data.

*   **Information**
    *   **Concept:** Data that has been organized, classified, and systematized for a specific purpose according to certain rules.
    *   **Characteristic:** Created when raw data are processed into a specific form to achieve a purpose.
    *   **Key Point:** Treatment and Processing.

*   **Knowledge**
    *   **Concept:** Generalized matter derived from several pieces of concrete information; created by analyzing the meaning and relationships of informational data.
    *   **Characteristic:** Requires establishing correlations between information. Involves human interpretation, meaning, and value judgment. Used for decision-making or creating added value.
    *   **Key Point:** Added value, Generalization, Decision-making, Internalized ability (wisdom).

**3.2. Types of Data Processing Systems**
Data processing systems are categorized by how data is organized and accessed.

*   **Batch Processing System**
    *   **Concept:** Data is collected over a period or in a certain amount, then processed all at once.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   System-centered (focus on high system performance, low processing cost).
        *   Requires preparatory work (collecting, classifying, organizing raw data into a file).
        *   Requires standby time (no immediate processing).
        *   Modifying changes before collective processing is complex.
    *   **Examples:** Payroll, grade processing, utility bill processing.

*   **Online Processing System (Real-time Processing System)**
    *   **Concept:** Data is processed immediately upon transfer to the computer.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   User-centered (focus on immediate response, higher processing cost, lower system performance requirements).
        *   No preparatory work needed.
        *   Maintains data currency (up-to-date).
        *   Difficult to maintain, repair, or restore.
    *   **Examples:** Airline/railroad seat reservations, bank deposit processing, stock trading systems.

*   **Distributed Processing System**
    *   **Concept:** Data is processed by connecting geographically dispersed processors and databases over a network.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Operates in a client/server model.
        *   Improves operation speed and reliability.
        *   Increases efficient use of resources.
        *   Software development is difficult.
        *   Relatively high security level and design complexity.

### 4. Understanding the Database

**4.1. The File Processing System**

*   **Concept:**
    *   Historically, a method of storing and retrieving paper documents.
    *   Since the 1960s, includes computerized records.
    *   Designed to arrange and manage user-recorded data on a physical disk, often using a hierarchical directory structure.
    *   Each application program accesses an individual file for searching, inputting, deleting, and modifying data.

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Application programs must directly implement the logical file structure as a physical file structure.
    *   Application programmers need extensive knowledge of the physical data structure to implement data access methods.
    *   Data sharing is difficult because each application often has its own data; typically, one file exists for one application only.

*   **Problems with File Systems:**
    *   **Lack of Data Independence (Program Dependent):** Changes to file structure require changes to all programs accessing it.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Data can differ depending on when it's retrieved (e.g., duplicated data in different files might not be updated simultaneously).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Semantically identical values might not be consistent across different files.
    *   **Low Sharing & Use Convenience:** Difficult to share, poor security management, and low economic feasibility due to redundancy and maintenance.

**4.2. The Database**

*   **Concept & Core Characteristics:**
    *   A database manages data centrally to minimize duplication.
    *   It has four fundamental characteristics:
        *   **Integrated Data:** Data is stored in one place as intensively as possible, eliminating or minimizing duplication (controlled redundancy).
        *   **Stored Data:** Data is saved in computer-accessible storage media (e.g., disk).
        *   **Operational Data:** Data required to perform an organization's unique functions (not temporary input/output data).
        *   **Shared Data:** Data jointly owned, maintained, and used by multiple application programs within an organization.

*   **Database Characteristics:**
    *   **Real-time Accessibility:** Supports immediate responses to occasional and informal queries.
    *   **Continuous Evolution:** Constantly changing due to data input, modification, and deletion (dynamic characteristics, accurately reflecting the current state).
    *   **Concurrent Sharing:** Supports multiple users accessing and sharing the same data simultaneously in different ways.
    *   **Content Reference:** Data can be accessed and retrieved by using its contents (e.g., searching for a specific value).

Database )
+ Preview  for practical  business
There are many cases in which a database  is used like an existing  file system,  and tables are created  in the
database,  but each table is actually  dependent  on individual  applications,  screens,  and reports.
For example,  when developing  a book management  system  for each team a booklist  table can be created
for each team during implementation  of the database  in the same way as managing  books using Excel files.
However,  if tables are designed  in the same way as Excel files, the advantages  of the database,  including
integration,  storage,  operation,  and sharing,  cannot  be utilized at all.
In this case, the complexity  of the application  program  also increases,  causing  problems  that can lead to
serious symptoms,  such as an increase  in the development  cost, problems  with data integrity  (lack of
consistency  due to data duplication),  and deterioration  of data processing  performance.  Therefore,  these
problems  can be prevented,  and the advantages  of the database  can be maximized  and applied  to system
development  only when we understand  the definition  and characteristics  of the database  (integration,
storage,  operation,  sharing)  and its advantages,  and apply them to practical  business.

01 Understanding  Data
A) Concept  and characteristics  of data, information,  and knowledge
@ Data
Data refers to the collected  resource  itself, which are the basic data discovered,  investigated, collected,  and created
in the real world. That is, data are related  to a fact, which refers to a natural  state free of the values  and judgments  of
human beings.
Q Information
Information  refers to various data that are organized,  classified,  and systematized  for certain purposes  according  to
certain rules. When data are processed  in a certain form, the information  necessary  for achieving  a specific  purpose  is
created,
@ Knowledge
Knowledge  refers to matter  that is generalized  from several  items of concrete  information.  It is created  while analyzing
and studying  the meaning  and relationship  of informational  data. Correlations  between  information  should be
established  to convert  information  into knowledge.  Therefore,  information  can vary significantly  depending  on how one
assigns  meaning  to informatized  data, analyzes  the relationship,  and judges  the values of the human  being. Enterprises
and institutions  manage  such information  or knowledge  in such a way as to make decisions  or create  added value.
