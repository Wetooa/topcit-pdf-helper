## Network Protocols Learning Guide: UDP & SCTP

### 1. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**A) Characteristics of UDP**

*   **Connectionless:** Sends and receives data without a prior connection setup.
*   **Unreliable:** Does NOT guarantee delivery, order, or error-free transmission. It's a "best effort service."
*   **Simple:** Minimal overhead compared to TCP.
*   **Independent Datagrams:** Each UDP datagram is standalone; no sequence numbers are assigned.
*   **No Flow Control:** No window mechanism, so packet overflow can occur.
*   **Limited Error Control:** Only includes a checksum to detect errors. If an error is found, the datagram is discarded.
*   **No Congestion Control:** Does not manage network congestion.
*   **Application Layer Responsibility:** Applications using UDP often need to implement their own flow, error, and sequence control if reliability is required (e.g., for real-time video, the application handles frame ordering and discarding delayed/corrupt data).
*   **Suitable For:** Applications where speed and low overhead are critical, and some packet loss is acceptable (e.g., video/audio streaming, online gaming, DNS).

**B) Common UDP Uses**

*   Simple request-response communication without built-in flow/error control.
*   Applications that implement their own flow/error control.
*   Multicasting (sending data to multiple destinations simultaneously).
*   Network management protocols (e.g., SNMP).
*   Routing update protocols (e.g., RIP).

**C) Well-Known UDP Ports**

| Service                  | Port | Description                       |
| :----------------------- | :--- | :-------------------------------- |
| NTP (Network Time Protocol) | 123  | Corrects host time over the network. |
| BOOTP Server, DHCP Server | 67   | Network IP address management.    |
| BOOTP Client, DHCP Client | 68   | Network IP address management.    |
| TFTP (Trivial FTP)       | 69   | Simpler file transfer than FTP.   |
| Kerberos                 | 88   | Computer network authentication.  |
| Syslog                   | 514  | System logging.                   |
| RIP (Routing Information Protocol) | 520  | Routing protocol.                 |
| RIPng                    | 521  | IPv6 routing protocol.            |
| Timed (Time Server)      | 525  | Time synchronization service.     |
| OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) | 698  | Routing protocol.                 |

**D) UDP Header Structure**

A UDP packet, called a **user datagram**, has a fixed 8-byte header.

| Field          | Length  | Description                                        |
| :------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source Port**    | 2 Bytes | Port number of the sending application (0-65,535). |
| **Destination Port** | 2 Bytes | Port number of the receiving application.          |
| **Length**         | 2 Bytes | Total length of the UDP header + data.             |
| **Checksum**       | 2 Bytes | Value for detecting data errors. (Calculated over pseudo-IP header, UDP header, and data). If zero, checksum is optional. |

### 2. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)

**A) Overview & Purpose**

*   A newer transport layer protocol designed for multimedia communication.
*   Combines advantages of both UDP (multi-streaming) and TCP (reliability, congestion control).

**B) Key Characteristics**

*   **Process-to-Process:** Provides communication between applications.
*   **Connection-Oriented:** Establishes a connection called an **association**.
*   **Multi-homing:**
    *   An association can connect multiple IP addresses at each endpoint.
    *   Provides network-level fault tolerance (if one path fails, another can be used).
    *   One IP is primary, others are alternatives.
*   **Multi-stream:**
    *   Allows multiple independent streams of data within a single association.
    *   Prevents "head-of-line blocking" where one blocked message delays all subsequent messages (common in TCP).
*   **Reliability:** Uses acknowledgments (ACKs) to confirm data arrival and retransmits lost data.
*   **Full Duplex:** Data can be sent in both directions simultaneously.

**C) SCTP Numbering Systems**

*   **Transmission Sequence Number (TSN):** Used to number individual data chunks for reliable transmission (similar to TCP's sequence number).
*   **Stream Identifier (SI):** A 16-bit number to distinguish different streams within an association.
*   **Stream Sequence Number (SSN):** Used to distinguish data chunks belonging to the *same stream* for ordered delivery within that stream.
*   **Data Units:** SCTP uses "data chunks" instead of bytes (like TCP).

**D) SCTP Functions**

1.  **Association Start and End:**
    *   Uses a **four-way handshake** to establish an association:
        1.  Endpoint A sends `INIT`.
        2.  Endpoint Z sends `INIT ACK` (with a cookie).
        3.  Endpoint A sends `COOKIE ECHO` (copying the cookie).
        4.  Endpoint Z sends `COOKIE ACK`.
    *   **SYN Attack Prevention:** The main system resource (Transmission Control Block - TCB) is only allocated at endpoint Z after receiving a valid `COOKIE ECHO`, preventing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks seen in TCP's three-way handshake.

2.  **Sequenced Delivery:**
    *   User messages are organized into streams, identified by an **SI**.
    *   **SSNs** ensure ordered delivery within each stream.
    *   One stream being blocked does not prevent other streams from transmitting data (multi-stream advantage).

3.  **User Data Fragmentation:**
    *   Like TCP, user messages are fragmented if they exceed the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
    *   Fragments are reassembled at the SCTP layer.

4.  **Acknowledgment and Congestion Avoidance:**
    *   Data chunks are assigned a **TSN** for reliability.
    *   Receiving side acknowledges (ACKs) received TSNs.
    *   If an ACK is not received within a timeout, packets are retransmitted.
    *   Congestion avoidance procedures are similar to TCP.

5.  **Chunk Bundling:**
    *   Allows multiple user data chunks or control chunks to be combined into a single SCTP packet for efficiency.

6.  **Packet Validation:**
    *   Uses a **Verification Tag (VT)** and a 32-bit checksum in the common header.
    *   **VT:** A unique value chosen during association setup; all packets in that association must carry the correct VT, or they are discarded.
    *   **Checksum:** A 32-bit CRC32c checksum (more robust than the 16-bit checksums in UDP/TCP/IP) prevents data corruption.

7.  **Path Management:**
    *   Manages the transport address, port, and IP address used for destination.
    *   **Primary Path:** Default path for transmitting/receiving packets.
    *   **Alternative Path:** If the primary path fails, an available address from the multi-homing setup can be used as an alternative.

**E) SCTP Packet Structure**

*   SCTP packets consist of a **General Header** followed by one or more **Chunks**.
*   **General Header Components:**
    *   **Source Port No.:** Same as TCP and UDP.
    *   **Destination Port No.:** Same as TCP and UDP.
    *   **Verification Tag (VT):** Identifies the association, repeated in all packets.
    *   **Checksum:** 32-bit CRC-32 (more robust than 16-bit checksums in TCP/UDP/IP).

*   **Chunks:**
    *   Carry control information or user data.
    *   Common fields in all chunks: `Type`, `Flag`, `Length`.
    *   **Type Field:** Indicates the specific chunk type (e.g., Payload Data, INIT, ACK).
    *   **Flag Field:** Defines special flags for certain chunks.

**F) Major SCTP Chunk Types**

| Type | Chunk Type      | Description                         |
| :--- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| 0    | Payload Data    | Carries user application data.      |
| 1    | INIT            | Initiates an association.           |
| 2    | INIT ACK        | Acknowledges an INIT.               |
| 3    | SACK            | Selective Acknowledgment.           |
| 4    | HEARTBEAT       | Used for keep-alive.                |
| 5    | HEARTBEAT ACK   | Acknowledges a HEARTBEAT.           |
| 6    | Abort           | Abruptly terminates an association. |
| 7    | SHUTDOWN        | Initiates graceful shutdown.        |
| 8    | SHUTDOWN ACK    | Acknowledges SHUTDOWN.              |
| 9    | ERROR           | Reports an error.                   |
| 10   | COOKIE ECHO     | Carries the security cookie.        |
| 11   | COOKIE ACK      | Acknowledges COOKIE ECHO.           |

03 UDP (User Datagram  Protocol)
A) Characteristics  of UDP
User datagram  protocol (UDP) provides  a connectionless  service for sending  and receiving  data without  a pre-
configuration  process  for connection.  Unlike TCP. it is a protocol  that does not guarantee  the reliability  of the
transport  layer level.
Each user datagram  of UDP is an independent  datagram  and is not assigned  a number, unlike TCP. UDP is a very
simple protocol,  and there is no flow control, so there is no window  mechanism,  and packet overflow  may occur.
Error Control also has no other error control mechanism,  except for checksum.  When the receiver  detects  an error
through  a checksum,  the user datagram  is removed,  and congestion  control is not provided.  Due to this nature of the
UDP transport  protocol,  the application  layer may be necessary  in order to define and implement  the flow control
and error control. As described  above, since the UDP has a continuous  minimum  transmission  rate, despite some
packet loss, due to a lack of reception  confirmation  and retransmission  function,  it is suitable  for video play service
and is considered  to provide the best effort service. In particular,  for playing video that is transmitted  in real time,
the transmitting  side must separately  include the image frame order in the data. The receiving  side must store it in a
separate  buffer, according  to the frame order and process  it in order. In the case of a streaming  method,  instead  of a
download  method,  if there is a delay for more than a certain time, or if only the B and P frames are received  without
the | frame, the application  layer needs to maintain  the real-time  property  by destroying  the data.
The UDP protocol  is mainly  used for the following  purposes.
+ Aprocess  requiring  simple request-response  communication,  without  flow and error controls
+ Aprocess  with internal  flow and error control techniques
+ Multicasting  transmission  technology
+ Management  processes,  like SNMP
+ Route update  protocols,  such as the routing information  protocol  (RIP)
<Table 66> below shows well-known  ports for widely used UDP services.  It supports  the NTP service that corrects
the host time through  the network,  the BOOTP  and DHCP services  that are network  IP management  protocols,  the
TFTP service  that is simpler  than FTP, the RIP and OLSR services  that are routing  protocols,  and the Kerberos  service
that is a computer  network  authentication  protocol.

B) UDP protocol
A UDP packet, called the user datagram,  has a fixed-size  8-byte header  made of four 2-byte (16-bit)  fields, as shown
below. Each field of the UDP header  is used for the purposes  shown in <Table 67>.
<Table  67> User Datagram  Header  Fields
Field Length Description
Source  Port 2Bytes The port number  of the source packet in the range of 0-65,535
Destination  Port 2Bytes The port number  of the destination  packet
Length 2Bytes The length of the entire packet, including  the UDP header  and data fields
Checksum 2Bytes A value to detect a data error
Data octets Variable | Storage  of data to be transmitted
The source port refers to the port of the transmitting  process,  and the destination  port refers to the port of a specific
destination  host. The length is the sum of the UDP header  (minimum  8) and the data size. The checksum  is the result
of adding 16-bit 1's complement  to the pseudo-IP  header, UDP header, and data. The checksum  field is filled with
zeros before the calculation.
As described  above, unlike TCP. the UDP protocol  is simple to implement  because  it receives  data from the application
layer and sends it down to the IP layer. It also analyzes  the UDP user datagram,  that is received  from the IP layer, and
delivers  it to an appropriate  application  program.
04 SCTP (Stream  Control  Transmission  Protocol)
A) Characteristics  of SCTP
The stream control transmission  protocol (SCTP) is a new transport  layer protocol  designed  by combining  UDP
and TCP advantages  for multimedia  communication  [3]. The service characteristics  of the SCTP are described  in
the following  table. The SCTP association  is a broader  concept  than the end-to-end  TCP connection. In an SCTP
association,  one or more IP addresses  can be connected  at each endpoint.  It is called multi-homing,  and it enables
network-level  fault tolerance. SCTP is called association  in order to highlight  its multi-homing  nature. While a stream
is transmitted  and received  to an end-to-end  connection  in TCP multiple streams  can be transmitte...
