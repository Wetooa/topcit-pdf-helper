05 Latest  Technologies  and Trends
A) Neuromorphic  chip
Neuromorphic  chip, a core technology  for neuromorphic  computing,  is a new semiconductor  type that processes
information  in a way that is similar  to human  thinking,  by implementing  brain behavior  in silicon as much as possible.
+ There are several cores in a semiconductor  chip, and electronic  devices, such as transistors  and memory,  are
embedded  into the core.
+ Some of the devices  in the core play the role of neurons  and neural cells in the brain, and the memory  chip plays a
synaptic  function  that links neurons.
+ Since the core, which acts as an artificial  neuron, is configured  in parallel like the human brain, it can process  a large
amount  of data with little power  and increase  the ability to learn and operate  like the human brain.

Neuromorphic  computers  do not only operate  in a preprogrammed  way, like conventional  semiconductor-based
computers,  but they can develop  their processing  power by detecting  the surrounding  context  and learning
autonomously.  Since devices  equipped  with the neuromorphic  chip can increase  learning,  operation  capability,  and
power efficiency,  they can apply intelligence  to all computing,  ranging  from loT, smartphones,  robots, automobiles,
cloud computing,  and supercomputing.
However,  there is still a lack of understanding  of how human neural circuits process  data at the system level, and
neuromorphic  computers  still remain at a level that simulates  single neurons.  There are many problems  to resolve

there is no clear leading  group with clear superior  competitiveness.

A quantum  computer  is a new conceptual  computer  that can simultaneously  process  a large volume  of information  at
a high speed, based on the principle  of ultra-high-speed,  large-capacity  computing  technology  optimized  for specific
operations,  according  to the principle  of overlapping  and entanglement  inherent  in quantum  mechanics.
