## 1. Overview of Information Security

### 1.1. Concept
*   **Information Security:** Protecting information (administratively, physically, technically) from damage, alteration, or leakage during collection, processing, storage, and transmission.

### 1.2. Need for Information Security
*   Increasing need for privacy guarantees and prevention of cybercrimes.
*   Growing concerns about leakage of domestic technologies and information due to globalization and internet connectivity.

### 1.3. Goals of Information Security (CIA Triad)
The three primary goals are:
*   **Confidentiality:** Preventing unauthorized users from accessing or viewing original information while it's stored or transmitted.
    *   *Example:* Encryption of customer data.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring information remains accurate and unaltered during transmission and storage. Preventing unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   *Example:* Using hash functions to detect changes.
*   **Availability:** Ensuring authorized users can access and use information when needed.
    *   *Example:* Maintaining server uptime and application functionality.

## 2. Basic Information Security Terms

### 2.1. Authentication
*   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of subjects (sender/receiver) and confirming that exchanged information has not been altered or deleted.

### 2.2. Non-repudiation
*   **Non-repudiation:** Security technology to prevent a sender or receiver from falsely denying sending or receiving a message.
    *   **Non-repudiation of Origin:** Prevents the sender from denying they sent a message.
    *   **Non-repudiation of Delivery:** Prevents the receiver from denying they received a message.
    *   **Non-repudiation of Receipt:** Prevents the receiver from denying they received a message.

### 2.3. Cryptography
*   **Cryptography:** Techniques and protocols for secure communication in the presence of adversaries.
    *   **Cryptographic Techniques:**
        *   **Symmetric Key Cryptosystem:** Uses the *same* key for both encryption and decryption.
        *   **Public Key Cryptosystem:** Uses *different* keys (a public key for encryption, a private key for decryption).
    *   **Cryptographic Protocols:** Rules or procedures using cryptographic techniques to achieve security goals like authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.

### 2.4. Digital Signature
*   **Digital Signature:** Provides data integrity and signature authentication.
    *   **How it works:** A hash value of a document is calculated, then signed using the sender's private key.
    *   **Efficiency:** Signing the hash value is more efficient than signing the entire message repeatedly.
    *   **Security:** Difficult to find another message with the same hash value, making the signature reliable.

### 2.5. Hash Function
*   **Hash Function (Hash Algorithm):** A mathematical function that converts an input of any length into a fixed-length, short output (hash value/code).
    *   **Key Characteristic:** Does not use a key, and the same input always produces the same output.
    *   **Use:** Primarily for integrity verification; can detect if an input message has been altered.

### 2.6. Malware
*   **Malware:** Malicious software designed to perform harmful actions against computers, file systems, or networks.
    *   **Worms:** Independent malware that replicates and spreads itself to other computers.
    *   **Viruses:** Malicious code inserted into other programs; it performs harmful actions and spreads when the host program runs.
    *   **Trojan Horse:** A program that appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious code, which executes when the user runs the program.

## 3. Major Security Solutions

### 3.1. Firewall
*   **Firewall:** A security solution placed between a public network (e.g., internet) and a private network to protect the private network.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Packet Filtering Gateway:** Blocks or allows packets based on a set of rules.
        *   **Proxy Server:** Provides authentication for specific hosts to access a private network.
        *   **Combined:** Uses both methods for increased security.

### 3.2. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
*   **IPS:** Detects and blocks unauthorized or abnormal behaviors (intrusions) in real-time within a target system or network.
    *   **Purpose:** Real-time detection and blocking of illegal activities like hacking, and defending against attacks that may bypass firewalls.

### 3.3. Virtual Private Network (VPN)
*   **VPN:** Technology allowing secure use of public networks as if they were a private network, providing access control, authentication, and confidentiality without building physical private networks.
    *   **Representative Technologies:** IPSec, SSL.
    *   **Implementation:** Can be implemented in dedicated systems, routers, or firewalls.

### 3.4. Single Sign-On (SSO)
*   **SSO:** Allows a user to log in once to one system or site and then access other linked systems or sites without re-authenticating.
    *   **Purpose:** Integrates user authentication across multiple systems that typically manage user information separately.

### 3.5. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
*   **WAF:** A security solution positioned in front of a web server.
    *   **Function:** Monitors incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic and blocks malicious attacks targeting web applications (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) before they reach the web server.

### 3.6. Network Access Control (NAC)
*   **NAC:** Checks if a user's computer complies with security policies (e.g., user authentication, anti-virus installation) when attempting to access an internal network.
    *   **Function:** Controls network access based on pre-defined security policies if compliance is not met.

### 3.7. Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)
*   **WIPS:** Continuously monitors a wireless LAN to automatically detect and block access from unauthorized wireless devices.
    *   **Purpose:** Enhances wireless LAN stability and enables integrated management by detecting and blocking intrusion attempts via unauthorized access points (APs) or user devices.

### 3.8. Enterprise Security Management (ESM)
*   **ESM:** Integrates security management functions to provide a consistent administrator and user interface.
    *   **Aim:** Build an efficient, policy-oriented, and systematic integrated security management system for all enterprise systems.

### 3.9. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
*   **SIEM:** Extends ESM by providing an early warning and monitoring system for intelligent threats.
    *   **Function:** Offers correlation analysis and forensic capabilities on large amounts of data, helping to trace threats rather than just collecting and analyzing logs. Includes corporate compliance response functions.

---

## 4. New Technical Terms

### 4.1. Blockchain
*   **Blockchain:** A distributed ledger designed so that network participants can store and verify data.
    *   **Structure:** Transactions occurring over a certain period (e.g., 10 minutes) are collected into a "block." These blocks are then sequentially linked together to form a "chain."
    *   **Purpose:** Used in cryptocurrency systems (like Bitcoin) to record all transactions in a public, distributed ledger.

+ Preview  for practical  business
Assistant  manager  Kim, working  for company  A has overseen  the development,  deployment,  and
maintenance  of Java source programs.  He used to check web pages and servers  on a regular  basis.
In this process, he should ensure the availability  of numerous  source codes that he is managing,  and
he should manage  the performance  and capacity  to ensure the availability  of the server, so that the
applications  can work properly.  He should also take technical  protection  measures,  like encryption,  to
maintain  the confidentiality  of customer  information  that is saved by the application.
He is trying to ensure confidentiality,  integrity,  and availability  of business  information.  Let’s take a
closer look at the concepts  and goals of information  security.
01 Overview  of information  security
A) Overview  of information  security
@® Concept  of information  security
Information  security  refers to protecting  information  administratively,  physically,  and technically  in order
to prevent  damage,  alteration,  and leakage  of information  while being collected,  processed,  stored, and
transmitted  information.
@ Need for information  security
The need to guarantee  privacy  and prevent  crimes on the Internet  is gradually  increasing.  Concerns  about the
leakage  of major domestic  technologies  and information are also increasing,  due to globalization,  as the entire
world is connected  through  the Internet.

[Figure 1] Three goals of information  security
* Confidentiality  means that the original information  is not exposed  to unauthorized  users while being stored and
transmitted.
+ Integrity  means  that the original information  is maintained  while sending  and receiving  it, without  illegal creation,
modification,  or deletion.
+ Availability  means that authorized  users can access and use the requested  information  when necessary.
02 Basic terms of information  security
A) Authentication
Authentication  refers to a method  of verifying  whether  the information  exchanged  between  the sender and
receiver,  who are the subjects  of the information,  has not been altered or deleted,  and whether  the subjects
(sender  and receiver)  are legitimate.
B) Non-repudiation
Non-repudiation  refers to security  technologyto  prevent  the repudiation  after receiving  and sending  a message,
by verifying  the fact of message  receiving/sending.  Non-repudiation  can be classified  into the following  three
categories:
@® Non-repudiation  of origin
Non-repudiation  of origin refers to the prevention  of the sender’s  claim that the message  was not received
after actually  receiving  the message.

Information  security )
@ Non-repudiation  of delivery
Non-repudiation  of delivery  refers to the prevention  of the receiver's  claim that the message  was not delivered
after actually  sending  the message.
® Non-repudiation  of receipt
Non-repudiation  of receipt refers to the prevention  of the receiver's  claim that the message  was not received
after actually  receiving  the message.
C) Cryptography
Cryptography  is largely  classified  into cryptographic  techniques  and encryption  protocol  techniques.
@® Cryptographic  techniques
Cryptographic  techniques  can be divided into the symmetric  key cryptosystem,  in which the encryption
key and the decryption  key are the samewhile  in the public key cryptosystem,  the encryption  key and the
decryption  key are different,  depending  on whether  the encryption  key and the decryption  key are the same.
@® Cryptographic  protocols
Cryptographic  protocols  refer to the protocols  that use cryptographic  techniques.  As a protocol  means a series
of finite phases  where more than 2 persons  participate  to achieve  a certain purpose,  the cryptographic  protocol
should prevent  repudiation  by a participant,  or a third party, to ensure a certain purpose  of the concerned
cryptographic  protocol  (authentication,  confidentiality,  integrity,  non-repudiation,  etc.), as well as the meaning
of each message.
D) Digital signature
A digital signature  is the method  of providing  both data integrity  and signature  authentication,  by performing
a hash operation  on a specific document,  using the signature’s  private key. Signing  the entire message  is very
inefficient  because  the public key opera...
