### 1. Open Innovation

**Definition:** Open innovation involves an enterprise collaborating with external entities to enhance its innovation capabilities. It's crucial because rapid IT advancements and convergence make it hard for companies to rely solely on internal R&D.

**Types of Open Innovation:**

1.  **Inward Open Innovation:** Obtaining knowledge or ideas from outside sources (companies, research centers, universities) during research, development, and commercialization.
    *   **Forms:**
        *   Technology Purchase
        *   Joint Research
        *   Sub-contracted Research
        *   Joint Venture Establishment
        *   Venture Investment
        *   Acquisition
2.  **Outward Open Innovation:** Sending a company's knowledge or ideas to the outside world for commercialization through other business models.
    *   **Forms:**
        *   Technology Sale
        *   Spin-off

### 2. IT Business Integration and Expansion

#### A. Business Platform

**Definition:** A basic structure (ecosystem) used to produce or sell various products and services. In today's market, competition is often between *corporate ecosystems*, making platforms a key strategy for competitive advantage.

**Role of a Platform:**
*   Foundation for creating and delivering value to participating companies.
*   A medium that connects and complements values produced by stakeholders.

**Key Functions:**
*   **Promote Exchanges:** Provides spaces for stakeholders to connect.
*   **Reduce Costs:** Offers time-consuming or costly functions on the platform.
*   **Increase Trust:** The platform's brand offers a sense of safety and trust to users.
*   **Create Advertising Revenue/Contact Points:** Services for broadcasters, magazines, etc.
*   **Provide Third-Party Services:** Facilitates exchanges between different groups.

**Example (Apple vs. Nokia):**
*   **Nokia (Symbian OS):** Focused on enterprise, complex development, high barriers for developers. Failed to become a standard, lost market share despite early entry.
*   **Apple (iOS):** Emphasized entertainment, built a content-centered ecosystem (App Store), attracted numerous developers. Successfully connected stakeholders and created value.

**Types of Business Platforms:**

| Type                 | Definition                                      | Purpose                                                    | Scope                 | Example                                     |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Product Platform** | Universal components for a broad range of products | Cost savings (reduced development/production costs)        | In-house              | Nokia (various phone series components)     |
| **Customer Platform**| Core customer group targeted by a company         | Increased revenue (customer solidification, diversified products) | Outside the company   | Woongjin Coway (home visit service network)|
| **Transaction Platform**| Infrastructure for transactions with external suppliers| Industry leadership (market position through partnerships) | Outside the company   | Apple (iTunes Store for 3rd party content)  |

**Future Outlook:** Business models will expand, and the platform market will continue to grow, likely at an accelerated pace.

#### B. API Economy

**Definition:** A business model where a company exposes its internal business assets or services to third parties as **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. This creates new business values through the production and consumption of new assets.

**Why it's Important:**
*   Allows companies to respond effectively to market demands.
*   Enables "assemblable" business models across channels.
*   Improves operational and business agility.
*   APIs provide a **platform-neutral environment** for application connections.
*   Facilitates sharing of customer data and marketing insights among member companies.

**Benefits:**
*   **For App Developers:** Utilize API open data to build new applications and offer customized services.
*   **For Companies:**
    *   Generate revenue by releasing data/services (e.g., Amazon, Twitter, Google).
    *   Maximize internal/external efficiencies by sharing core assets.
    *   Enhance service quality and stability (e.g., E*Trade's stock trading API).

**Challenges:**
*   Developing and managing APIs is complex.
*   Essential management tasks: account management, authentication, security.
*   Requires systemized management due to increasing number and diversity of APIs.

**API Value Chain:**
The flow of value from API providers to end-users:
1.  **Business Assets:** Company's core data/services.
2.  **Web APIs:** Assets exposed through APIs.
3.  **Developers:** Use APIs to build innovative applications.
4.  **Apps:** Applications built using APIs.
5.  **End Users:** Use apps based on customer insights, leading to increased sales for the original business.

**Strategic API Management:**
*   Companies providing APIs must understand the needs of both developers and end-users.
*   Implement systems for monitoring and managing released APIs.
*   Provide clear documentation and communication channels for external developers.
*   Crucial for managing diverse customer contact points in the mobile-centric era.

#### C. Servitization

**Definition:** A fundamental business model transformation where a product evolves into a **service bundle** that continuously delivers value throughout the customer experience lifecycle. This shifts competition towards services, where revenue is linked to the availability, reliability, and performance of a company's assets.

**Trends:**
*   Accelerating in traditional manufacturing sectors.
*   Companies are moving away from product-only sales models.
*   Increased focus on differentiating through combining products with software.

**SW (Software) Convergent Models for Products:**

1.  **Product-Centered Model:** Strengthens service elements without sacrificing the sales-oriented product model.
2.  **Usage-Based Model:** Producer retains ownership but sells the *right to use* the product (e.g., subscription, pay-per-use).
3.  **Additional Sales-Oriented Model:** Producer sells diverse value-added services based on an already sold product.

**Why it's Important:**
*   Companies strengthen software convergence capabilities to be flexible and competitive.
*   Software convergence is a key factor in determining product value and corporate performance.
*   Optimizes business models for rapidly changing consumer environments.

**Examples of Convergent Products and Services:**

| Industry       | Company     | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Electronics    | Apple       | Built a service ecosystem using iTunes, App Store.                                                       |
| Electronics    | Xerox       | Transformed from a facsimile manufacturer to a supplier of document management systems.                     |
| Electronics    | Philips     | Acquired Health Watch (2006) to venture into the healthcare service market.                               |
| Automobile     | GM          | Acquired 5.5 million customers through OnStar (telematics services subsidiary).                         |
| Heavy Industry | Caterpillar | Provides remote management service for excavators (GPS-based analysis, parts, fuel efficiency, monitoring).|
| Infrastructure | Vinci       | Airport/road/parking operation services account for 56% of operating profits despite 14% of total revenue. |

Understanding  the IT Business  and Ethics )
Open innovation  can be divided into inward open innovation  and outward  open innovation.  In inward open innovation,
an enterprise  obtains know-how  or ideas from an outside  company,  research  center or university  during the course
of researching,  developing,  and commercializing  a specific item. In outward  open innovation,  a company  sends its
knowledge  or ideas to the outside  world in order to commercialize  them through  other business  models.  There are six
main forms of inward open innovation:  technology  purchase,  joint research,  sub-contracted  research,  establishment
of a joint venture,  venture  investment,  and acquisition.  As for outward  open innovation,  technology  sale and spin-off
are its two main forms.
With the rapid advances  made in IT technology, convergence  as a trend is gaining momentum  and the pace of
development  of new products  through  convergence  has become  much faster than before, making it difficult  for
companies  to keep up with the pace of market changes  simply by dint of their own R&D efforts. Open innovation
capability  as a means of strengthening  innovation  capability  in the face of structural  transformation of technology
and business  management  is expected  to have a huge impact  on the growth  of companies  in the coming  years,

@ Business  platform
A platform is a basic structure  commonly  used to produce  or sell various products.  Today, as competition  among
corporate  ecosystems  in the business  market intensifies,  the platform  is increasingly  being viewed as a key strategy
for securing  a competitive  edge using one’s enterprise  ecosystem.
This signifies that as goods and services  become  ever more complex  and the network  effects between  suppliers  and
consumers  increase,  the pattern of competition  is changing  from competition  between  companies  to competition
between  corporate  ecosystems.  The platform  is the foundation  for creating  and delivering  values to the participating
companies,  and its role as a medium  can determine  the fate of the enterprise  eco-system.  The main functions  of a
business  platform  are described  below.
<Table  64>Major  functions  of the business  platform
Category Description
Promote Promote  exchanges  between  interested  stakeholders  by providing  locations  where they can connect  with
exchanges each other.
Reduce  costs Reduce  costs by providing  time-consuming  and costly functions  on the platform.
Increase  trust — The platform  brand can offer a sense of safety  and trust to the actual users.
Create  advertising  revenues  or develop  consumer  points  of contact  by providing  services  to broadcasters,
magazines,  newspapers,  etc.
Provide  third-party  services  to promote  exchanges  between  different  groups.Provide  third-
party services
The importance  of the platform  is clearly illustrated  by the examples  of Apple and Nokia. Although  Nokia entered  the
smartphone  market  earlier  than Apple, its platform  was edged out of the market  by competition  with Apple.
Symbian,  Nokia's operating  system, had a very complex  development  environment  because  it was geared for the
enterprise  market  and focused  on enterprise  application.  It failed to become  a standard  because  the entry barriers  to
developers  were too high. However,  in the case of Apple, it emphasized  the entertainment  functions  of the iOS and
built an online contents-centered  ecosystem  (App Store) which attracted  the participation  of numerous  developers.
In other words, the platform  became  a medium  that connected  and complemented  the values produced  by
