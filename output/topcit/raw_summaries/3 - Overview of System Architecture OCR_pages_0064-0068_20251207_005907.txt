## Computer System Architecture: A Learning Guide

This guide covers the fundamental structure, processing, and memory organization of computer systems.

---

### **1. Computer Structure & Architecture Types**

#### **1.1 Basic Computer Structure**
A computer system typically consists of:
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The "brain" that executes instructions.
*   **Memory:** Stores data and instructions.
*   **I/O Devices:** Input (e.g., keyboard) and Output (e.g., monitor) tools for user interaction.
*   **System Bus:** Connects all these components, allowing them to communicate.

#### **1.2 Types of Computer Architecture**

Two primary architectures define how the CPU interacts with memory:

*   **Von Neumann Architecture (1945)**
    *   **Concept:** Uses a single memory and a single bus for both instructions and data.
    *   **Operation:** CPU reads commands (instructions) and reads/writes data from/to the *same* memory.
    *   **Limitation:** Instructions and data cannot be accessed simultaneously, creating a "bottleneck."

*   **Harvard Architecture**
    *   **Concept:** Uses separate memories and separate buses for instructions and data.
    *   **Operation:** CPU can read instructions and access data in parallel.
    *   **Advantage:** Improves performance by solving the Von Neumann bottleneck.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Bus system design becomes more complex.

*   **Modern High-Performance CPUs**
    *   Combine both architectures.
    *   **Inside CPU (CPU & Cache):** Apply Harvard architecture (separate cache for instructions and data).
    *   **Outside CPU (CPU & Main Memory):** Apply Von Neumann architecture.

---

### **2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

The CPU is the most critical part of a computer, responsible for executing programs and processing data.

#### **2.1 CPU Definition**
*   Interprets instructions.
*   Handles arithmetic and logical operations.
*   Processes data.

#### **2.2 CPU Execution Process**
The CPU follows specific steps to execute instructions:

*   **Commonly Performed for All Instructions:**
    1.  **Instruction Fetch:** Reads an instruction from memory.
    2.  **Instruction Decoding:** Interprets the fetched instruction to determine the required action.
*   **Performed When Necessary (Data-Related):**
    3.  **Data Fetch:** Reads data from memory or I/O if the instruction requires it.
    4.  **Data Processing:** Performs operations (e.g., arithmetic, logic) on the fetched data.
    5.  **Data Storage:** Stores the results of the execution.

#### **2.3 CPU Components**
A CPU consists of several key hardware modules connected by buses:

1.  **Control Unit (CU):**
    *   Generates control signals.
    *   Interprets program codes (instructions) and manages their execution sequence.
2.  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
    *   Executes arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    *   Executes logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
3.  **Registers:**
    *   Small, high-speed temporary storage areas within the CPU.
    *   Store instructions awaiting processing or intermediate results of operations.
    *   **Key Register Types:**
        *   **PC (Program Counter):** Stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
        *   **IR (Instruction Register):** Holds the instruction currently being executed.
        *   **AC (Accumulator):** Stores results of ALU operations.
        *   **MAR (Memory Address Register):** Stores the memory address for read/write operations.
        *   **MBR (Memory Buffer Register):** Temporarily holds data read from or written to memory.
        *   **SP (Stack Pointer):** Points to the top of the stack in memory.
4.  **Buses:**
    *   Common transmission lines connecting CPU, memory, and I/O units.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Address Bus:** Transmits memory addresses generated by the CPU.
        *   **Data Bus:** Transmits data between CPU, memory, and I/O units.
        *   **Control Bus:** Transmits control signals from the CPU to manage system components.

#### **2.4 Instruction Cycle**
The instruction cycle is the complete process the CPU performs to execute a single instruction, repeating from program start until power-off or error. It consists of four main phases:

1.  **Fetch Cycle:**
    *   **Action:** Fetches an instruction from the memory location pointed to by the Program Counter (PC).
    *   **CPU Components Involved:** PC, MAR, MBR, IR, CPU internal bus.
2.  **Indirect Cycle (Optional):**
    *   **Action:** If an instruction uses indirect addressing, this cycle reads the actual data address from memory *before* execution.
    *   **CPU Components Involved:** MAR, IR, MBR, CPU internal bus.
3.  **Execution Cycle:**
    *   **Action:** The CPU decodes the fetched instruction and performs the specified operation (e.g., arithmetic, logic, data transfer).
    *   **CPU Components Involved:** AC, ALU, Control Unit.
4.  **Interrupt Cycle (Optional):**
    *   **Action:** Checks for interrupt requests. If an interrupt occurs, the current PC value is saved, and the starting address of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is loaded into the PC.
    *   **CPU Components Involved:** MBR, PC, MAR, SP.

### **3. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**

ISA refers to the set of machine language instructions a microprocessor can recognize, understand, and execute. It defines how software communicates with hardware.

#### **3.1 Leading ISAs: CISC and RISC**

*   **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**
    *   **Concept:** Embeds many complex, multi-step instructions into the hardware.
    *   **Execution:** A single CISC instruction can perform multiple low-level operations.
    *   **Instruction Length:** Variable length. Stores only necessary info, reducing code waste and program size.
    *   **Control System:** Micro-program type (instructions are translated into a sequence of micro-operations).
    *   **Compiler:** Simpler structure (less work for the compiler as hardware handles complexity).
    *   **Registers:** Fewer general-purpose registers.
    *   **Examples:** Intel x86 series processors.

*   **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**
    *   **Concept:** Embeds a few, simple, single-cycle instructions into the hardware.
    *   **Execution:** Complex operations are performed as a sequence (set) of simple RISC instructions.
    *   **Instruction Length:** Fixed to 32 bits (standardized size). Easier to apply pipelining (overlapping instruction execution).
    *   **Control System:** Hard-wired type (faster execution as instructions are directly interpreted).
    *   **Compiler:** More complex structure (compiler must break down complex tasks into simple instructions).
    *   **Registers:** Many general-purpose registers.
    *   **Examples:** ARM, MIPS processors.

---

### **4. Memory Unit Hierarchical Structure**

Computer memory is organized in a hierarchy based on speed, cost, and capacity. Higher levels are faster, more expensive per bit, and smaller in capacity, but are accessed more frequently by the CPU.

*   **Registers:**
    *   **Level:** Highest, directly within the CPU.
    *   **Characteristics:** Fastest, most expensive per bit, smallest capacity, highest CPU access frequency.
*   **Cache Memory (Internal Memory):**
    *   **Level:** Between CPU and Main Memory.
    *   **Characteristics:** Very fast, expensive, small capacity. Stores frequently accessed data/instructions from main memory.
*   **Main Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory):**
    *   **Level:** Primary working memory.
    *   **Characteristics:** Moderately fast, less expensive than cache, larger capacity. Directly accessible by the CPU.
*   **Auxiliary Memory (External Memory / Secondary Storage):**
    *   **Level:** Lowest. Examples: Hard drives (HDD/SSD), USB drives.
    *   **Characteristics:** Slowest, cheapest per bit, largest capacity, lowest CPU access frequency. Used for long-term storage of data and programs.

B) Types of computer  architecture
The types of computer  architecture  include the von Neumann  architecture,  which is a structure  that applies the
stored-program  design principle'  , suggested  by von Neumann  in 1945, and the Harvard  architecture  which separates
instruction  memory  and data memory.  As shown in [Figure 31], these two types have different  memory  structures,
and each has advantages  and disadvantages.
+ Von Neumann  architecture:  The CPU can read commands  from the memory  and can read and write data both from
the memory  and to the memory.  Instructions  and data cannot be accessed  simultaneously  because  they use the
same signal bus and memory.
+ Harvard architecture:  It solves computer  bottlenecks  by storing commands  and data in different memories  and
improves  performance  by reading  and writing commands  in parallel. However,  the bus system design becomes
complex.

ESSENCE
Since the von Neumann  and Harvard  architectures  each has advantages  and disadvantages,  the most recent high-
performance  CPUs apply both architectures  in their design. In other words, they separate  the cache memory  for
instruction  and data, and they apply the Harvard  architecture  inside the CPU (CPU and cache) and the von Neumann
architecture  outside  CPU (CPU and memory),  as shown in [Figure  32].
