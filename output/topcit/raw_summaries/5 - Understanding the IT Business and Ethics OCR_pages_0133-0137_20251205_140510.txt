### Section 1: Servitization

**What is Servitization?**
*   A business model transformation where a **product evolves into a service bundle**.
*   Focus shifts from selling products to **delivering continuous value** throughout the customer lifecycle.
*   Revenue generation is tied to the **availability, reliability, and performance** of a company's assets.

**Why is it Important?**
*   Traditional product sales models are becoming less effective.
*   Companies find it hard to **differentiate products based on merits alone**.
*   Servitization, especially by **combining products with software**, offers a path to differentiation and competitive edge.
*   Software convergence capabilities are now crucial for product value and corporate performance.

**Three Software-Convergent Models for Servitization:**

1.  **Product-centered model:** Strengthens service elements *without* abandoning the core product sales model.
2.  **Usage-based model:** Producer retains ownership but sells the *right to use* the product (e.g., subscription, pay-per-use).
3.  **Additional sales-oriented model:** Producer sells diverse *value-added services* based on an already sold product.

**Examples of Servitization:**

*   **Apple:** Built a service ecosystem (iTunes, App Store).
*   **Xerox:** Transformed from facsimile manufacturer to document management systems supplier.
*   **Philips:** Acquired Health Watch to enter healthcare service.
*   **GM (OnStar):** Provides telematics services (e.g., navigation, emergency assistance).
*   **Caterpillar:** Offers remote management for excavators (analysis, parts, fuel efficiency, monitoring).
*   **Vinci:** Airport/road/parking operation services generate a disproportionately high percentage of operating profits compared to total revenues.

*   **Key Benefit:** Allows rich web applications (video, voice, 2D graphics) *without requiring separate plug-ins* (like Flash or ActiveX).
    *   *Example:* Accessing Kakao Talk or using word processors/games directly via a web browser without installation.
*   **Overcomes:** Problems associated with older plug-in solutions (e.g., functional expansion through CSS3 and JavaScript APIs).
*   **Design Principles:** Compatibility, practicality, interoperability, and universal access.
*   **New Features:**
    *   **Semantic Markup:** 26 new markups for clearer semantic representation than HTML4.
    *   **APIs:** New functions like `web form`, `canvas`, and `web socket` for web-based application development.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Less JavaScript code needed for the same functionality compared to HTML4.
    *   Better for mobile environments (sensitive to network speed).
    *   Maximizes scalability and efficiency for corporate business solutions.

**2. Responsive Web / Adaptive Web**
*   **Problem Solved:** Users want consistent web content quality across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) despite different screen sizes and specifications. Developing a separate web version for every device is impossible.
*   **Definition (Responsive Web):** A web design approach that creates an **optimal user environment by adapting to different devices and screen sizes**.
    *   The website's layout and content **automatically change size and arrangement** to fit the user's device.
*   **Current Trend:** Mobile web users now exceed regular internet web users, making responsive design essential.

@ Servitization
The term “servitization”  refers to a fundamental  transformation  of the business  model in which a product  evolves
into a service bundle that continues  to deliver value throughout  the lifecycle  of a customer  experience.  This means
that the system of competition  has shifted to around service  whose revenue  generation potential is intimately  tied
to the availability,  reliability  and performance  of the company’s  assets. In particular,  this phenomenon  is expected  to
accelerate  in the traditional  manufacturing  sector  where revenues  are generated  from the sales of goods.
As the traditional  product  sales model gives way to a service model and as companies  find it increasingly  difficult  to
differentiate  themselves  on the merits of their products  alone, many are striving  to differentiate  themselves  through
servitization,  ie. by combining  their products  with software.  The software  model for the servitization  of a product  can
be one of three types, as shown below,
<Table  65>SW  convergent  model of products
Type of model Description
Product-centered  model | A model which features  strengthened  service  elements  without  sacrificing  the sales-oriented  model.
A model in which the producer  retains  the ownership  but sells the right to use the product  to anUsage-based  model outside  party,
Additional  sales-oriented  | A model in which the producer  sells diverse  value-added  services  based on a product  that has
model already been sold.
Many companies  are strengthening  their software  convergence  capabilities  so as to be able to respond  flexibly  to
the changing  environment  and secure a competitive  edge in the market  through  servitization.  Software  convergence
capabilities  are becoming  a key factor in determining  the value of products  and corporate  performance.
Many companies  are converging  their products  and software  to optimize  their business  models and respond to the
rapidly changing  consumer  environment.
<Table 66>Examples  of convergent  products  and services  of major companies®
Industry Company Description
Apple Built a service ecosystem  using iTunes, App Store.
. Transformed  itself from a facsimile  manufacturer  into a supplier  of document  managementElectronics Xerox
systems.
Philips Acquired  Health Watch in 2006 to venture into the healthcare  service market.
Automobile cM Acquired  5.5 million customers  through  OnStar, its subsidiary  company  which supplies
telematics  services.
Through  a GPS-based  remote management  system,  Caterpillar  provides  a service  for
Heavy industry Caterpillar analyzing  the status and history of excavator  equipment,  replacing  parts, improving  fuel
efficiency,  and monitoring  illegal use
Airport/road/parking  operation  services  account  for 56% of operating  profits although  they
tala Vinci only bring in 14% of the total revenues.

>> Recent  trends and key issues
The rapid development  of IT network  and IT infrastructure technologies  has not only brought  about
a revolution  in the IT industry,  but also introduced  IT-based  innovations  across all industries. Existing
products  are being reborn as products  with new values through  convergence  with IT technology,  while
technologies  that received  little or no attention  in the early stages of their development  are now becoming
a reality and attracting  renewed  interest  due to their integration  with other technologies.  Meanwhile,  public
services  built around smart infrastructures  have greatly improved  efficiency  in managing  public services.
Diverse industries  are constantly  turning  out new products  that feature convergence  services.  However, it
must be understood  that these market  changes  and paradigm  shifts would not have occurred  without  the
latest IT business  services  and technologies.
