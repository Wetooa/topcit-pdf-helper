### **03. Software Development Methodology**

A **Software Development Methodology** defines the structured approach for creating software. It outlines development phases, activities, deliverables, verification procedures, and standards from planning to implementation.

#### A) Why We Need Software Development Methodologies:
*   **Boost Productivity:** Accumulate and reuse past development experience.
*   **Effective Management:** Facilitate efficient project oversight.
*   **Improve Communication:** Provide formal procedures, standard terminology, and clear deliverables.
*   **Ensure Quality:** Verify and approve each phase to maintain a certain quality level.

#### B) Comparison of Software Development Methodologies:

| Item                    | Structural Methodology               | Information Engineering Methodology | Object-Oriented Methodology           | CBD Methodology                       |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Overview/Focus**      | Focuses on activities/processes.     | Focuses on data.                    | Focuses on objects and classes.       | Develops/combines reusable components. |
| **Key Principles**      | Requirements definition, structuralization, stepwise refinement, modularization. | Information strategy, business analysis, system design. | Analysis, design, development, testing based on object concepts. | *(Implicit: Component reuse, modularity)* |
| **Characteristics**     | Divide and conquer, program logic-centric, structured modules. | Supports business systems, data integration focus, program logic linked to data. | Data and logic unified (objects), emphasizes interfaces, reuse via inheritance, smooth analysis-design transition. | Modular interfaces, component-based implementation, aims for "black box" reuse. |
| **Major Deliverables**  | Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), program specifications. | Business process/conceptual diagrams, data structure diagrams. | Use case, sequence, class diagrams.     | Use case, sequence, class, component diagrams, reuse plans. |
| **Sample Tools**        | Teamwork, SA                         | Cool Gen, SA                        | Rose, SA, Plastic, Cool Joe, Together | Component, EJB                        |
| **Supported Languages** | COBOL, C, VB, PASCAL                 | COBOL, C, VB, PASCAL                | C++, JAVA, VB                         | Generally language-agnostic.          |

#### C) Software Development Phases:

1.  **Requirements Analysis:**
    *   **Goal:** Understand exactly what the user needs the software to do. This is often the hardest part.
    *   **Importance:** It's the critical first step. Thorough analysis early on significantly reduces overall development costs, shortens development time, and prevents quality issues later.

2.  **Design:**
    *   **Goal:** Translate conceptual requirements into a physical system structure.
    *   **Process:** Determines the system's architecture, breaks it into sub-systems, and allocates components (hardware/software).
    *   **Importance:** Directly impacts software quality and stability. Poor design leads to unstable, difficult-to-maintain systems.

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   **Goal:** Write the program code based on the design specifications to satisfy the requirements.
    *   **Key Task:** Adhere strictly to detailed design and user guides. Establishing and following a clear **coding standard** is crucial for code clarity and consistency.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Inspect and evaluate the system to ensure it meets requirements and identify any discrepancies between expected and actual results (manually or automatically).
    *   **Purpose:** The final step in assuring software quality. It's a series of tasks designed to find faults and facilitate modifications for quality improvement.

### **04. Agile Development Methodology**

**Agile Methodologies** are a set of approaches to software development that emerged from the Agile Manifesto. They prioritize iterative development, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.

#### A) Types of Agile Methodologies:
*   **Most Widely Adopted:**
    *   **Scrum:** (Ken Schwaber/Jeff Sutherland) – Popular for project management.
    *   **eXtreme Programming (XP):** (Kent Beck/Erich Gamma) – Popular in early days, now often used with Scrum.
*   **Other Key Types:**
    *   **Lean Software Development:** (Mary Popendieck/Tom Poppendieck) – Applies lean production principles to software, often used with Scrum.
    *   **Agile Unified Process (AUP):** (Scott Ambler)

#### B) Agile Development Methodology - eXtreme Programming (XP):

#### 1. XP Overview:
*   **Creator:** Established by Kent Beck and others in the late 1990s.
*   **Nature:** A lightweight, iterative development method.
*   **Suitability:** Best for small to medium-sized development teams.
*   **Focus:** Emphasizes specific development techniques like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration.
*   **Application:** Often combined with other agile methods like Scrum rather than used in isolation.
*   **Structure:** Built upon core values and practices designed to achieve these values.

#### 2. XP Development Procedure & Terminology:
*   **User Stories:** Brief descriptions of desired functions from a user's perspective, used for requirements gathering and communication.
*   **Spike:** A simple, experimental program created to explore difficult requirements or potential technical solutions, reducing risk.
*   **Release Planning:** Establishes the project's overall deployment plan, dividing it into regular, short iterations (1-3 weeks).
*   **Acceptance Test:** Testing performed by the customer before a release to verify it meets their needs.
*   **Smaller Releases:** Frequent, small-scale deployments that provide early benefits and value to the customer.

#### 3. XP Values:
*   **Communication:** Essential for team success; fosters problem-solving and stronger team dynamics among customers, developers, and managers.
*   **Simplicity:** Always aim for the simplest possible solution that meets current requirements, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
*   **Feedback:** Seek frequent and rapid feedback to enable continuous, gradual improvement, rather than striving for initial perfection.
*   **Courage:** Be brave enough to adapt to changes, actively solve problems, and deliver solutions quickly. This value underpins simplicity and feedback.
*   **Respect:** The fundamental value; mutual respect among all team members is crucial for a project's success.

#### 4. Extreme Programming Practices:
XP suggests 12 core practices:

| Practice                  | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Design**         | Design only for current needs, keeping it as simple as possible.             |
| **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** | Write automated tests *before* writing the actual code.                  |
| **Refactoring**           | Improve the internal structure of existing code without changing its external behavior. |
| **Coding Standard**       | Use consistent coding standards for clarity and effective team communication. |
| **Pair Programming**      | Two developers work together at one computer, collaboratively writing code.  |
| **Collective Code Ownership** | All team members share responsibility for all code and can improve any part of it. |
| **Continuous Integration** | Integrate code changes frequently (multiple times a day) to detect issues early. |
| **Planning Game**         | Collaborative planning that balances business and technical needs, updated iteratively with feedback. |
| **Small Release**         | Deliver small, functional releases frequently to customers.                  |
| **Metaphor**              | Use simple analogies or stories to describe the system's architecture and functionality. |
| **40 Hours/Week**         | Maintain a sustainable 40-hour work week to ensure quality and prevent burnout. |
| **On-Site Customer**      | A customer representative works directly with the development team at the development site. |

#### C) Scrum:

#### 1. Scrum Overview:
*   **Purpose:** An agile project management methodology; an empirical approach based on estimation and continuous adjustment.
*   **Origin:** Modeled after "The New Product Development Game" (1986). Formalized for software development by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in 1995.
*   **Structure:** Composed of three fundamental units (roles).

#### 2. Type of Scrum Units (Roles):

| Role             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Product Owner** | Represents stakeholders, defines and prioritizes the **Product Backlog** (a list of all desired product features). They are key in sprint planning but should minimize involvement in the development team's daily operations once a sprint begins.                                  |
| **Scrum Master** | A facilitator who helps the development team follow Scrum principles and values. Their primary responsibility is to remove any obstacles (**impediments**) that hinder the team's progress and ensures the Scrum process is understood and enacted. |

C) Software  development  phases
Software  development  activities  are defined  by the software  lifecycle.
@ Requirements  analysis
+ The hardest  thing in software  development  is deciding  exactly  what to develop.
+ Software  requirements  analysis is practically  the first step in software  development  and is the phase of
understanding  what the user needs.
+ Itis a critical phase that can reduce the development  costs in the entire development  phase.
+ If investment  is channeled  into analyzing,  defining  and managing  the requirements  well in the early stages,
the entire software  development  period can be shortened  and excessive  costs and quality deterioration  can
be prevented  in advance.
@ Design
+ The software  requirements  analysis  process  is a conceptual  step, whereas  the design process  is the first step
in physical  realization.
+ When designing  a system,  the structure  of a system,  which is composed  of sub-systems,  is determined,  and
sub-systems  are allocated  to the components,  such as hardware  or software.
+ Design directly  affects  quality.
+ If a system  is not designed  properly,  its stability  deteriorates.
+ Unstable  systems  are difficult  to maintain
@® Implementation
+ The goal of the software  implementation  phase is to program it in a way that the requirements  can be
satisfied based on the design specification.
+ The program  should be written according  to the description  in the detailed  design and user’s guide.
* One of the most important  tasks in the implementation  phase is to decide on a coding standard  and write
the code clearly based on that standard.
