## 2. Statistical Process Control (SPC)

**SPC** stands for **Statistical Process Control**. It is a management technique that uses statistical data and analysis to control and improve processes, especially in manufacturing, to ensure consistent product quality.

### Key Aspects of SPC:

*   **Statistical:** Relies on statistical data and analysis.
*   **Process:** Focuses on a given product's quality specifications and process capability.
*   **Control:** Allows businesses to manage product conditions during production.

### Objectives & Effects of SPC:

*   **Continuous Improvement:** Repeatedly improves processes.
*   **Maintain Quality:** Sustains high rates of satisfactory quality goods.
*   **Defect Analysis:** Conducts engineering analysis of defect causes to find solutions.
*   **Uniform Quality:** Aims to produce goods of uniform quality within a narrow range.
*   **Reduce Variation:** Minimizes process variations.
*   **Stabilize Processes:** Establishes foundations for producing zero-defect goods.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Enhances productivity, leading to significant cost savings and higher profits.

### Constituent Elements of SPC:

1.  **Deviation:**
    *   Indicates product quality attributes.
    *   Refers to the distribution of values around a central point or the trend of this value.
    *   Occurs due to **common causes** (inherent to the process) or **assignable causes** (specific, identifiable issues).
2.  **Process Management & Capability:**
    *   Managerial ability to reduce deviations.
    *   Aims to keep deviations within an allowable range by repeatedly eliminating common and assignable causes.
3.  **Distribution & Statistics:**
    *   Schematic diagram showing deviation trends.
    *   Goal: Minimize distribution range by continuously managing common causes and eliminating assignable causes.

### Tools Used in SPC:

*   **Data Collection Instruments:** Work logs, checklists, inspection device data.
*   **Statistical Techniques:** Control charts, histograms, scatter plots, Pareto diagrams, cause-effect diagrams.

## 3. Recent Trends in IT Business Services

The IT business landscape emphasizes customer-centricity and integrated operations.

### Key Trends:

*   **Customer-Centric Quality:** Service quality is defined by customer requirements. Understanding customer needs is paramount.
*   **Integrated Value Chains:** IT business services are interconnected, involving customers, partner companies (suppliers), and other stakeholders. Integrated analysis across the entire value chain is crucial.
*   **End-to-End Process Management:** The trend is towards operating the entire "purchase-production-sales-post management" cycle as a single, connected process, rather than fragmented operations.
*   **Continuous Quality Control:** Quality control must extend from the very beginning to the very end of a service, including supplier services.
*   **Systematic Information Flow:** Effective management of information flow between general-purpose internal systems (e.g., ERP) is vital for continuous quality control.

---

## 4. Core IT Business Systems

IT business services are supported by various systems, enhancing competitiveness and innovation.

### A. Enterprise Solutions (General-Purpose Work Support Systems)

**Enterprise Solutions** are information systems that support management activities to maximize business efficiency and gain competitive advantages. They are not just tools but crucial enablers for business survival and growth.

*   **Definition:** A collective term for information systems that support management activities to maximize business efficiency and competitive advantages.
*   **Value:** Depends on how business processes are defined and not solely on system functions.
*   **Scope:** Includes IT planning, job-specific solutions, system building, and ongoing maintenance.

**Key Enterprise Solution Systems:**

*   **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning):** Integrates all facets of an operation, including product planning, development, manufacturing processes, sales, and marketing.
*   **SCM (Supply Chain Management):** Manages the flow of goods, data, and finances related to a product or service, from raw materials to delivery.
*   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** Manages all interactions with current and potential customers to improve business relationships.

These systems help enterprises maintain close customer relationships by analyzing their needs.

### B. Decision-Making Support Systems

These systems aid decision-makers in maximizing business value.

*   **DSS (Decision Support System):** Computerized systems used to support decision-making activities in an organization or a business.
*   **BI (Business Intelligence):** Uses strategies and technologies for data analysis of business information.
*   **EDW (Enterprise Data Warehouse):** The backbone for DSS and BI. It collects internal and external data for analysis, providing a unified source of truth for decision-making.

---

## 5. IT Service Management (ITSM)

**ITSM** is a management technique for the systematic management of IT services. It focuses on delivering IT services that meet user needs and improve service quality.

### Key Aspects of ITSM:

*   **Frameworks:** Leverages frameworks like **ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library)** for defining IT service processes and activities.
*   **Standards:** Can be combined with international standards like **ISO/IEC 20000** to improve and enhance IT service quality.
*   **Service Levels:** Requires defining and managing **Service Levels** in advance to ensure user satisfaction.
    *   **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A contract that defines the level of service expected from a vendor.
    *   **SLM (Service Level Management):** The process of managing service levels to ensure they meet agreed-upon targets and satisfy customers.

### Practical Application Example (Company K):

Company K, a trading company, adopted ITSM to:

*   **Improve Quality:** Enhance the quality of IT resource maintenance and repair.
*   **Stabilize Operations:** Stabilize IT infrastructure operation.
*   **Advanced Processes:** Deploy advanced operational processes.

**Implementation with ITIL:**

*   **ITIL-based Processes:** Implemented to improve operational efficiency.
*   **Transparent Management:** Real-time monitoring of service levels.
*   **Supplier Management:** Effective management of suppliers to preserve high service quality.
*   **Malfunction Prevention:** Strategies for preventing malfunctions and real-time monitoring/analysis of key logs.

**Tools & Benefits:**

F) Understanding  SPC
© Overview  of SPC
SPC stands for “Statistical  Process  Control’:  This term contains  the word ‘statistical’  because  it relies on statistical
data and analysis  techniques;  the word ‘process’  because  it represents  a given product  quality specification  and
the capacity  of the process; and ‘control’  because  the technique  allows enterprises  to control the condition  of the
product  when it is produced.
+ SPC is a management  technique  that allows enterprises  to make repeated  improvements  to a process  and maintain
high rates of production  of goods of satisfactory  quality.
+ SPC allows enterprises  to conduct  an engineering  analysis  of the causes of defects  and establish  the best way of
rectifying  the problem  in a reasonable  manner.
@ Effects  of SPC
The objective  of using the SPC technique  is to produce  goods of uniform quality within a narrow range of quality
distribution.  Therefore,  SPC-oriented  management  reduces  process  variations  and ultimately  stabilizes  each

process,thus  laying the foundations  for the production  of zero-defect  goods. With SPC, enterprises  can produce
high-quality  goods, and enhance  their productivity  to levels that will lead to significant  cost reductions,  thereby
contributing  to higher profits.
@ Constituent  elements  of SPC
<Table 33> Constituent  elements  of SPC
Component  elements Description
+ Aproduct  attributes  which indicates  the product’s  quality. Deviation  refers to the distribution  of
Deviation values around a central value or the trend of this value.
+ Deviations  occur mainly due to a common  caused  or an assignable  cause.6
Process  management + Managerial  ability for reducing  deviation.
and process + Deviations  are kept within the allowable  range of the product  by the repeated  elimination  of common
capability causes and assignable  causes. .
+ This refers to a schematic  diagram  of the deviation  trend caused by common  causes  and assignable
causes.
Distribution  and * Creating  a minimum  amount  of spraying  is an important  goal: In order to achieve  this goal, the cause
statistics of ‘coincidence’  must be continuously  managed  and the cause of ‘sputum’  removed.
+ Keeping  the distribution  to a minimum  range is an important  goal: In order to meet this goal, an
enterprise  must continuously  manage  the common  cause and eliminate  the assignable  cause.
Besides  the component  elements  described  above, statistical  data must be collected  for the variance  analysis.
The instruments  used in data collection  include the work log, checklists,  and inspection  device  data among other
things.
The statistical  techniques  used in SPC analysis  include the control chart, histogram,  scatter  plot, Pareto diagram,  and
cause-effect  diagram.
