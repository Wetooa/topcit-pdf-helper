## Learning Guide: Modern IT Concepts

### I. Blockchain

**What is Blockchain?**
A decentralized system where transaction ledger data is recorded, managed, and verified in "blocks" across all network participants (nodes). Unlike traditional methods, there's no central server.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Decentralized:** No central server. All network nodes work together to prove and guarantee data integrity.
*   **Improved Security:** Transactions are accepted only after consent from over half of the network nodes, making modification/manipulation impossible.
*   **Transparency of Transactions:** All participants share ledgers, disclosing transaction details.
*   **Enhanced Safety:** The distributed nature means the network can recover even if some nodes experience errors or abnormalities.
*   **Improved Economics:** Reduces centralized management and financial transaction costs by removing the need for a central server.
*   **Protection of Personal Data:** Lessens the risk of data collection burdens, security issues, or leaks from central system errors or hacking.

**How Blockchain Transactions Work (Concept):**
1.  **Initiation:** User A wants to transfer money to User B.
2.  **Block Creation:** Transaction data is generated as a "block."
3.  **Sharing:** The block is shared with all network participants.
4.  **Validation:** Participants cross-validate the transaction data.
5.  **Registration:** Once validated (by >50% of nodes), the block is registered onto the blockchain.
6.  **Completion:** Money transfer from A to B is complete.

### II. Smart Infrastructure

#### A. Smart City

**Definition:** An urban model that solves city problems and improves quality of life by adopting new technologies like ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and Big Data.

**Purpose:** Addresses issues such as:
*   Aging infrastructure
*   Energy shortages
*   Environmental pollution
*   Crime

**Technologies Used:** AI (Artificial Intelligence), Big Data, 5G mobile technologies.

**Service Areas:** Smart traffic, smart environment, public safety, public welfare, smart energy.

#### B. Smart Grid

**Definition:** A next-generation power system that integrates IT technologies with existing power grids to monitor and control power supply and demand in real-time, matching production and consumption.

**Key Differences: Traditional Grid vs. Smart Grid**

*   Improves electricity quality and reliability through efficiency and distributed energy sources (e.g., renewables).

**Characteristics:**
*   Consumers can actively participate in energy management.
*   Supports diverse ways of generating and storing electricity.
*   Leads to new products, services, and markets.
*   Provides high-quality electricity.
*   Enables connection to both centralized and distributed power generation sources (e.g., renewable energy).

**Smart Grid Components:**
1.  **Smart Grid Platform:**
    *   **Core:** Intelligent devices, bi-directional communication, sophisticated control systems.
    *   **Function:** Manages distributed and intelligent power grids.
    *   **Operations:** Supports renewable energy applications, intelligent electric vehicle charging stations, smart metering, power grid monitoring, demand response.
    *   **Intelligent Devices:** Have electronic sensors and meters to monitor the grid state, capable of basic autonomous decisions.
2.  **Smart Grid Applications:** Utilize the platform for specific functions (e.g., monitoring, managing electricity grid, smart metering, V2G - Vehicle-to-Grid).

**IT Infrastructure Role:**
*   Optimizes energy efficiency.
*   Encourages consumption changes through real-time, bi-directional information exchange.
*   Requires open system networks and protocols to foster new products, services, and markets.
*   Communication infrastructure must provide reliable end-to-end services between intelligent devices.
*   Development must adhere to standards for interoperability across various interfaces.

#### C. Micro Grid

**Definition:** An extension of a smart grid. A group of interconnected consumers and Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) that can operate as a single controllable entity. It can connect to the main grid or function independently.

**Simplified View:** A local power grid connecting electricity users with distributed energy resources (like wind and solar). It can be self-sufficient but also connect to the regular grid when needed.

**Examples (South Korea):** Pilot testing in Jeju Island's smart grid complex, Gapado, Marado, and Ulleungdo.

#### D. Smart Water Grid

**Definition:** A smart technology that leverages ICT to manage water, including the essential substance itself, water supply, and sewage water.

*   Production of drinkable water.
*   Transportation of water.
*   Processing and reuse of water.
*   Integrates traditional and diverse water resources (underground, rainwater, reclaimed sewage, saline water).

Since all nodes in the blockchain  network  are responsible  for block creation  and verification,  and a transactions  is
accepted  only when more than half of the nodes approve  the transaction,  it is impossible  to modify  or manipulate  the
transaction  arbitrarily.
B) Smart  infrastructure
@ Smart  city
There is much news and interest  around the concept  of smart cities. A smart city can be defined as an "urban
model that can solve various urban problems  and improve  the quality of life in a city through  the adoption  of new
technologies  like ICT and Big Data."?
Smart cities are seen as an answer  to the problems  of aging infrastructures,  energy shortages,  environmental
pollution  and crime faced by cities around the world. To build such a smart city, the latest technologies  like Al, Big
Data, 5G mobile technologies  are employed  in the development  of “smart  traffic’, “smart  environment’,  “public safety’,
“public  welfare”  and “smart energy”  services.  Smart city concept  is the leading  example  of smart infrastructure.

@ Smart grid
Smart grid refers to a next-generation  power system that combines  IT technologies  with existing  power grids to
monitor  and control the supply & demand  of power supplies  in real time to match the production  and consumption
of electric  power. In traditional  power systems  the generation  of power is centralized  which means power producers
unilaterally  supply power to consumers.  Power plants are built to meet the estimated  maximum  consumption  level,

but they are less efficient  because  they cannot  flexibly  handle  fluctuations  in demand.  However,  in a smart  grid, power
suppliers are able to flexible set the power prices and control the supply and consumers  can check their cumulative
power usage levels and the power prices. These two aspects  result in efficient  consumptions  of power. A smart grid
can also benefit producers  of renewable  energy sources  whose supply of power can often be unpredictable  because
power  from renewable  energy  sources  can be sold at high prices when the demand  for power  is at its peak.
A comparison  of traditional  electric  power grid and the Smart Grid reveals  the following  differences.
