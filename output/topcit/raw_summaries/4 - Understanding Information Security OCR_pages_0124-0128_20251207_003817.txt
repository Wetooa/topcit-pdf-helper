# Learning Guide: Information Security Essentials

## 1. SSL Protocol

### 1.1 Operating Procedure (SSL Handshake)
The SSL protocol establishes a secure connection through a 5-phase handshake:

*   **Phase 1: Client Hello**
    *   The client initiates an SSL connection by sending a "Hello" message to the server.
*   **Phase 2: Server Hello**
    *   The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, its server certificate, and its public key.
    *   *(Optional):* The server may also request a client certificate.
*   **Phase 3: Client Verification & Key Exchange**
    *   The client verifies the server's certificate for validity.
    *   The client creates a **session key** (for encryption) and encrypts it using the server's public key, then sends it to the server.
    *   *(Optional):* If the server requested a client certificate, the client sends it.
*   **Phase 4: Cipher Specification Negotiation**
    *   Both parties agree on the encryption algorithm and key that will be used for data exchange, based on security negotiation.
*   **Phase 5: Encrypted Data Exchange**
    *   Encrypted data is exchanged between the client and server according to the negotiated cipher specification.

### 1.2 Utilization

#### A. Installing an SSL Certificate on the Server
To apply SSL to a web server:
1.  Generate a **private key** on the web server.
2.  Create a **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)** document.
3.  Send the CSR to a **Certification Authority (CA)** to request an SSL certificate.
4.  Receive the SSL certificate from the CA and install it on the web server (or an **SSL accelerator**, if used).

#### B. How to Check SSL Application
You can verify if SSL is applied to a web server by observing:
*   **URL Bar:** Displays "https://" and a padlock icon.
*   **Security Warnings:** A security warning window appears if you move from an HTTPS page to an HTTP page.
*   **Security Seal:** A security certification seal (e.g., GeoTrust, VeriSign) is displayed.

#### C. Consideration on Load After SSL Application
*   **CPU Workload:** The SSL handshake process is computationally intensive and puts a heavy load on the CPU.
*   **SSL Accelerator:**
    *   **Purpose:** A hardware or software solution to offload the CPU-intensive SSL processing.
    *   **Implementation:** Can be a separate PCI card, dedicated equipment, or a function integrated into web accelerators and L4 switches (often requiring a license).
*   **Post-Application Steps:**
    *   Change all relevant URLs in web applications and configurations to "https://".
    *   Improve web application response speed for static content (images, JavaScript, CSS) by utilizing SSL web browser cache or a web accelerator.

## 2. WLAN Security

### 2.1 Characteristics of WLAN
*   **Broadcast Nature:** Wireless LAN (WLAN) communicates using radio waves, broadcasting data in the air. This means data is exposed to all wireless LAN users during transmission.
*   **Higher Vulnerability:** Due to its broadcast nature, WLAN is inherently more vulnerable to security threats than wired LANs.
*   **Public WLAN Risk:** Public wireless LANs (e.g., public Wi-Fi hotspots) are particularly susceptible to security incidents.
*   **IEEE 802.11 Structure:**
    *   **BSS (Basic Service Set):** A fundamental unit consisting of stations (STAs) that share the same wireless medium and MAC protocol.
    *   **ESS (Extended Service Set):** An environment where multiple BSSs are connected via a Distribution System (DS) to allow communication between them.

### 2.2 Security Threats and Responses
The inability to physically control the communication medium (radio waves) makes WLANs vulnerable to various threats.

#### A. Technical Security Threats
These involve exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless technology.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Eavesdropping/sniffing sensitive user data by collecting radio waves.
    *   **Illegal Access:** Unauthorized access and infiltration into the internal network.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.**
    *   **Jamming/Denial of Service (DoS):** Attacks using large packet transmissions to disrupt service.
    *   **Hacking Weak Settings:** Exploiting old or weak security protocols like **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**.
*   **Responses:**
    *   **Standard Protection:** Configure strong security features on the wireless **AP (Access Point)**, such as **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)**.
    *   **Advanced Protection (for corporate/sensitive data):** Implement professional wireless security systems like **WIPS (Wireless Intrusion Prevention System)**.

#### B. Administrative Security Threats
These arise from human error or inadequate management practices.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Insufficient Management:** Poor oversight of wireless LAN equipment and devices.
    *   **Lack of User Awareness:** Users' lack of security knowledge leading to intrusions.
    *   **Improper Access:** Allowing unauthorized outsiders to access internal APs or insiders to access external APs due to poor radio wave management.
*   **Responses:**
    *   Establish and implement management plans for all wireless access devices and terminals.
    *   Regularly educate users and conduct security awareness training.
    *   Continuously monitor for and check illegal internal and external access attempts.

#### C. Physical Security Threats
These involve physical access or damage to wireless hardware.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Exposed APs:** Wireless APs are often installed in accessible, exposed locations to optimize signal transmission, making them vulnerable to:
        *   Theft or physical damage.
        *   Power shutdown or LAN cable disconnection, leading to service failure.
    *   **Lost Devices:** Loss of wireless devices can leak stored WLAN access credentials and security settings, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Responses:**
    *   Ensure wireless APs are securely placed and not exposed to unauthorized access.
    *   Periodically change security setting information (e.g., Wi-Fi passwords).
    *   Implement device management and loss prevention plans for all WLAN-enabled devices.

### 2.3 Wireless LAN Security Standards

#### A. IEEE 802.11i Services
*   **Background:** The initial WLAN security protocol, **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**, proved highly vulnerable to various attacks (e.g., brute-force).
*   **Purpose:** The IEEE 802.11i standard was developed to address WEP's weaknesses and provide robust security for wireless LANs.
*   **Key Goals:**
    *   Strong user authentication.
    *   Secure key exchange mechanisms.
    *   Advanced wireless section encryption algorithms.
*   **Implementation:** Achieved through **IEEE 802.1X authentication**, a **4-way handshake** for key exchange, and the **CCMP (Counter Mode With CBC-MAC Protocol)** encryption algorithm.

#### B. IEEE 802.11i Components
The 802.11i standard defines services and utilizes specific protocols and algorithms, collectively forming a **Robust Security Network (RSN)**.
*   **Core Services:**
    *   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of both the user and the authentication server (AS), and generates a temporary key for the client-AP link.
    *   **Access Control:** Manages message routing and key exchange based on authentication, often using various authentication protocols.
    *   **Privacy through Message Integrity:** Encrypts MAC layer data and adds a message integrity code to prevent tampering. This provides confidentiality, data origin authentication, integrity, and replay protection.
*   **Key Protocols & Algorithms:**
    *   **Authentication Protocol:** IEEE 802.1X Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
    *   **Encryption Algorithms:**
        *   **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol):** An older algorithm, used in WPA.
        *   **CCMP (Counter Mode With CBC-MAC Protocol):** A stronger algorithm, standard for WPA2.
    *   **Key Management:** Uses a 4-way handshake.

Phase 1 The client sends a “Hello” message  to the server.
The server  sends a Server Hello message,  server  certificate,  and public key to the client, together  with a clientPhase 2certificate  request  if it is needed.
The client verifies  the validity  of the server's  certificate, creates  a session  for encryption,  and encrypts  it
Phase 3 with the server's  public key. If the cipher specification  and server  request  the client's  certificate, the client's
certificate  is also sent.
The client sends signals  to exchange  encrypted  data, using the algorithm, and the key is defined  in cipherPhase  4 paaane . -
specification  through  security  negotiation.
Phase 5 Encrypted  data is exchanged  according  to the cipher specification  for which security  negotiation  is performed.
® Utilization
+ Installing  an SSL certificate  in the server
An SSL certificate  should be installed  in the web server to apply SSL.  A certificate  signature  request
document,  called CSR (Certificate  Signing Request)  should be created and requested  to the certification
authority  after creating  a private key in the running  web server. Then, an SSL certificate  should be received
from the certification  authority  and installed  in the web server in order to set the web server. If the SSL
accelerator  is used, the certificate  can also be installed  in the SSL accelerator.

+ Consideration  on the load after SSL application
Various  computing  tasks created  during the SSL handshake  process put a heavy workload  on the CPU. The
SSL accelerator  is a solution  released  to solve such a heavy workload  on the CPU. The SSL accelerator  can
be installed  on the server as a separate  PCI card or dedicated  equipment.  Recently,  since the web accelerator
and L4 switch provide an SSL accelerator  as a separate  function,  only a separate  SSL accelerator  license
needs to be purchased.
The connection  URL and the URL included  in the web application  source should be changed  to “https://”  after
applying  SSL. In addition,  the web application  response  speed can be improved  when the SSL load of the
static content,  such as images,  JavaScript,  CSS (CascadingStyleSheets),  etc. is increased,  using an SSL web
browser  cache or a web accelerator.
03 WLAN security
A) Characteristics  of the WLAN
Since incoming  and outgoing  data is broadcast  in the air in the wireless LAN, using radio waves, the  data is
exposed  to all wireless  LAN users while it is being transmitted.
The use of wireless  LAN is increasing  rapidly because  it has various  advantages  and convenience.  However,
security is more vulnerable  than wired LAN because  of the characteristic  of using radio waves as a
communication  medium.  Therefore,  security  should be considered  more seriously.  In particular,  there is a high
possibility  of various security  incidents  in the environment  that is opened to the public, like a public wireless
LAN. Therefore,  security  should be taken into account.
[Figure 66] shows the structure  of the general WLAN, defined by the IEEE 802.11. In this figure, the Basic
Service  Set (BSS) is a unit composed  of stations  (STAs)  that compete  for access  to the same wireless  medium,
while running  with the same MAC protocol.  And the extended  service set refers to an environment  in which
multiple  basic service sets can be connected  to a distribution  system  in order to communicate  with each other.
