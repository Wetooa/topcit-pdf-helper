Computer System Architecture
Clustered Systems
•A type of multiprocessor system that is loosely coupled .
•Designed for high-availability , achieved through redundancy .
•Composed of two or more nodes (computer system)  joined 
together . 
•Each node can monitor other nodes. If a node fails, a monitoring 
node can take over the task and resources, allowing the former 
node to restart Has two types:
•Symmetric  – all machines are running applications, but requires to be 
able to run more than one application in a system.
•Asymmetric  - one machine is hot-standby mode ready to take cover
•Can provide high-performance computing  (greater than SMP) 
through parallelization .
