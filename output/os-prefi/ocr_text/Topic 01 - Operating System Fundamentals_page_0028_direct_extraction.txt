Computer System I/O Structure
•I/O Structure
•I/O Operation : 
1.The device driver loads the appropriate registers within the device 
controller 
2.The device controller examines the contents of these registers to 
determine what action
3.The controller starts the transfer of data from the device to its local buffer .
4.The device controller informs the device driver via an interrupt  that it has 
finished its operation. 
5.Device driver then returns control to the operating system, possibly 
returning the data or a pointer to the data if the operation was a read. For 
other operations, a status information is returned instead
This is fine for small amounts of data, but inefficient for larger ones. To solve 
this, direct memory access ( DMA) is used.
