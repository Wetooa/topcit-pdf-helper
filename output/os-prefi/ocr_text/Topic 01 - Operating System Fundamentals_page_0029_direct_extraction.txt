Computer System I/O Structure
•I/O Structure
This is fine for small amounts of data, but inefficient for larger ones. To solve 
this, direct memory access ( DMA) is used.
After setting up buffers, pointers, and 
counters for the I/O device, the device 
controller transfers an entire block of data 
directly  to or from its own buffer storage 
to memory, with no intervention by the 
CPU.
Only one interrupt is generated, to signal 
that the operation is done.
