## Learning Guide: Computer System Fundamentals

### 1. Computer System Booting Sequence

The boot process is the sequence of operations that a computer performs when it is turned on. It involves loading essential software to get the system ready for use.

*   **Bootstrap Program:** The initial program loaded when a computer starts. Its primary job is to locate and load the operating system's kernel into memory.
*   **Kernel:** The core part of the operating system. It manages the system's resources (like memory and CPU) and provides an interface between hardware and software.
*   **Daemon:** Background processes that run continuously, performing specific tasks without direct user interaction (e.g., managing network connections, printing services).

### 2. Computer System Storage Structures

Computer systems use a hierarchy of storage to balance speed, cost, and capacity.

#### A. Storage Hierarchy Principles

*   **CPU Storage:** The CPU needs incredibly fast access to data.
*   **Speed Gap:** There's a challenge because very large storage is typically much slower than what the CPU needs, creating a "speed gap."
*   **General Rules:**
    *   **Higher levels in the hierarchy are faster.**
    *   **Faster storage is more expensive per bit.**
*   **Volatility:**
    *   **Volatile Memory:** Requires power to maintain the stored information. Data is lost when power is removed (e.g., RAM).
        *   Generally, anything above an SSD in the hierarchy (like CPU registers, cache, main memory) is volatile.
    *   **Nonvolatile Memory:** Retains information even without power (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).
        *   SSD and below in the hierarchy are nonvolatile.

#### B. CPU CORE REGISTERS

Registers are the fastest and smallest type of memory in a computer system.

*   **Location:** Located directly inside the CPU core.
*   **Speed:** The fastest possible memory available to the CPU.
*   **Size:** Extremely small, measuring only in bits or bytes.
*   **Purpose:** Hold immediate data that the CPU is actively processing (e.g., operands for calculations like "1 + 1").
*   **Volatility:** Volatile (data is lost when power is removed).
*   **Examples:** Common registers include RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSP, RBP (these are general-purpose registers used for various operations).
