## Linux Command Learning Guide

This guide covers essential commands for managing files, processes, and basic shell scripting.

---

### 1. File & Directory Management

Commands for organizing and manipulating files and folders.

*   **`cp SOURCE DESTINATION`**: Copies files or directories.
    *   `-r`: Copy recursively (required for directories).
    *   `-i`: Prompt before overwriting an existing file.
    *   `-u`: Copy only if SOURCE is newer than DESTINATION, or if DESTINATION doesn't exist.
    *   `-v`: Show verbose output (progress).
    *   *Example:* `cp -r mydir /backup/`
*   **`mv SOURCE DESTINATION`**: Moves or renames files or directories.
    *   `-i`: Ask before overwriting.
    *   `-u`: Move only if SOURCE is newer than DESTINATION, or if DESTINATION doesn't exist.
    *   `-v`: Show verbose output (progress).
    *   *Example:* `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` (rename)
    *   *Example:* `mv file.txt /new/location/` (move)

---

### 2. File Viewing & Editing

Commands to inspect and modify file contents.

*   **`cat FILE`**: Displays the entire content of a file to the terminal.
    *   *Useful for short files.*
*   **`less FILE`**: Displays file contents page by page, allowing scrolling.
    *   **Navigation within `less`:**
        *   `SPACE`: Scroll down one screen.
        *   `b`: Scroll up one screen.
        *   `/keyword`: Search for a specific keyword.
        *   `q`: Quit `less`.
*   **`nano FILE`**: Opens a file in the Nano text editor for editing.
    *   **Nano Shortcuts:**
        *   `CTRL-X`: Exit the editor. (Will prompt to save if changes are made).
        *   `CTRL-O`: Save current changes to the file.
        *   `CTRL-W`: Search for text within the file.

---

### 3. File Permissions & Ownership

Commands to control who can read, write, or execute files.

*   **`chmod PERMISSIONS FILE`**: Modify file permissions.
    *   **Adding/Removing Permissions:**
        *   `chmod +w script.sh`: Adds write permission for the current user (if no category specified, applies to owner).
        *   `chmod -x script.sh`: Removes execute permission for the current user.
        *   *Categories:* `u` (user/owner), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all).
            *   *Example:* `chmod u+x script.sh` (add execute for owner)
            *   *Example:* `chmod go-w file.txt` (remove write for group and others)
    *   **Octal Notation (`chmod 755 FILE`):**
        *   Uses three digits (0-7) to set permissions for **Owner**, **Group**, and **Others**.
        *   Each digit is a sum of:
            *   **4** = Read (`r`)
            *   **2** = Write (`w`)
            *   **1** = Execute (`x`)
            *   **0** = No permissions
        *   **Example `755`:**
            *   **7** (Owner): `rwx` (4+2+1)
            *   **5** (Group): `rx` (4+1)
            *   **5** (Others): `rx` (4+1)
    *   *Example:* `chmod 755 myscript.sh` (Owner has full, Group and Others can read/execute)
*   **`chown USER:GROUP FILE`**: Change the owner and/or group of a file.
    *   *Example:* `chown john:devs report.txt` (changes owner to `john` and group to `devs`)
    *   *Example:* `chown jane file.txt` (changes only the owner to `jane`)

---

### 4. Process Management

Commands to monitor and control running programs.

*   **`ps aux`**: Lists all active processes running on the system.
    *   `a`: Show processes for all users.
    *   `u`: Display detailed user information for each process.
    *   `x`: Show processes not associated with a terminal.
*   **`top`**: Displays real-time system statistics and a list of running processes, sorted by CPU usage by default.
    *   **Navigation within `top`:**
        *   `q`: Quit `top`.
        *   `k`: Kill a process (prompts for PID).
        *   `M`: Sort processes by memory usage.
*   **`kill PID`**: Sends a signal to terminate a process by its Process ID (PID).
    *   *To find PID, use `ps aux` or `top`.*
    *   **`kill -9 PID`**: **Force kill** (SIGKILL). Immediately terminates the process; it cannot ignore this signal. Use as a last resort.
    *   **`kill -15 PID`**: **Graceful kill** (SIGTERM). Asks the process to terminate gracefully, allowing it to save data or clean up before exiting. This is the preferred method.

---

### 5. Shell Script Components

A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands for the shell to execute.

*   **Shebang (`#!`)**:
    *   The **first line** of a script, specifying the interpreter to use (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).
    *   Crucial for the script to execute properly.
*   **Comments (`#`)**:
    *   Lines starting with `#` are ignored by the shell interpreter.
    *   Used to explain the script's logic or add notes.
    *   *Example:* `# This script lists files`
*   **Variables**:
    *   Store data within the script.
    *   **Assignment:** `variable_name="value"` (no spaces around `=`).
    *   **Access:** Use `$` before the variable name (e.g., `echo "Hello, $variable_name!"`).
*   **Input and Output**:
    *   **`echo "TEXT"`**: Prints text or variable content to the terminal.
    *   **`read VARIABLE_NAME`**: Reads user input from the terminal and stores it in the specified variable.
*   **Control Statements**: Dictate the flow of execution.
    *   **`if` / `else`**: Conditional execution.
        ```bash
        if [ "CONDITION" ]; then
            # Commands if condition is true
        else
            # Commands if condition is false
        fi
        ```
    *   **`for` loop**: Iterates over a list of items.
        ```bash
        for i in {1..5}; do
            echo "Iteration $i"
        done
        ```
    *   **`while` loop**: Repeats commands as long as a condition is true.
        ```bash
        count=1
        while [ "$count" -le 5 ]; do
            echo "Count: $count"
            count=$((count + 1)) # Increment count
        done
        ```
*   **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code.
    ```bash
    greet() {
        echo "Hello, $1!" # $1 refers to the first argument passed to the function
    }
    greet "Alice" # Calls the function 'greet' with "Alice" as the argument
    ```
*   **Exit Status (`$?`)**:
    *   A special variable holding the exit status of the **last executed command**.
    *   **`0`**: Indicates successful execution.
    *   **Non-zero (1-255)**: Indicates an error or failure.
    *   *Example:*
        ```bash
        mkdir test_dir
        echo "Exit status of mkdir: $?" # Prints 0 if successful, non-zero if it failed
        ```

Shell Script 
Components
Shell Script - a text file 
containing a series of 
commands that are 
executed sequentially by a 
shell interpreter .
1.Shebang (#!) – 
Specifies the interpreter
•Ideally the first line of a 
shell script
•Without this, the script 
may not execute 
properly
thescript.sh
#!/bin/bash
# COMMENTS
# This script prints "Hello, World!"
echo "Hello, World!"
# COMMENDS
echo "Listing files:"
ls -l
# VARIABLES
name="Jefferson"
echo "Hello, $name!"
# INPUT AND OUTPUTS
echo "Enter your name:"
read user_name
echo "Hello, $user_name!"
# CONTROL STATEMENTS
if [ "$name" == "Jefferson"  ]; then
  echo "Welcome, $name!"
else
  echo "Access Denied!"
fi
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
while [ "$count"  -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
# FUNCTIONS
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "Jefferson"
# EXIT STATUS
mkdir test_dir
echo "Exit status: $?"  # Prints 0 if 
successful
