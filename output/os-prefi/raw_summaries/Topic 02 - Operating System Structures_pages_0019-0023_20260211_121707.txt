## Linux Basics: Essential Commands Learning Guide

This guide covers fundamental Linux commands for user identification, shell management, and file/directory operations.

---

### 1. Checking Your Current User Information

These commands help you identify who you are on the system.

*   **`whoami`**
    *   **Purpose:** Prints the username of the current user.
    *   **Example:**
        ```
        mario@host~$ whoami
        mario
        ```

*   **`id -u`**
    *   **Purpose:** Prints the User ID (UID) of the current user.
    *   **Key Fact:** The **root user** (administrator) always has a UID of `0`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```
        mario@host~$ id -u
        1000
        root@host~# id -u
        0
        ```

### 2. Identifying and Changing Your SHELL

The shell is a command-line interpreter that processes commands.

*   **`which $SHELL`**
    *   **Purpose:** Shows the full path of your current default shell. This is useful for scripting or understanding your environment.
    *   **Example:**
        ```
        $ which $SHELL
        /bin/bash
        ```

*   **Changing Your Shell to Bash**
    *   **Purpose:** If your system uses a different shell, you can switch to `bash` (a common and powerful shell).
    *   **Method 1 (Interactive):**
        ```bash
        $ chsh
        ```
        This command will prompt you to enter the new shell path.
    *   **Method 2 (Direct):**
        ```bash
        $ chsh -s /bin/bash
        ```
        This directly sets `/bin/bash` as your default shell.

### 3. File and Directory Management

These commands are crucial for navigating and manipulating the filesystem.

*   **`pwd`**
    *   **Purpose:** **P**rints **W**orking **D**irectory. Displays the absolute path of your current location in the filesystem.
    *   **Example:**
        ```bash
        $ pwd
        /home/mario/documents
        ```

*   **`ls`**
    *   **Purpose:** **L**i**s**ts files and directories in the current directory (or a specified directory).

    *   **Common Options:**
        *   **`-l` (Long Format):** Shows detailed information including permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification date.
        *   **`-a` (All):** Shows all files, including hidden ones (those that start with a `.`).
        *   **`-h` (Human Readable):** Displays file sizes in an easy-to-understand format (e.g., K for kilobytes, M for megabytes). Best used with `-l`.
        *   **`-R` (Recursive):** Lists the contents of subdirectories as well.

    *   **Combining Options:** You can combine multiple options, e.g., `ls -lah` for long format, all files, and human-readable sizes.

    *   **Understanding `ls -l` Output Example:**
        Consider the output: `-rwxrw-r-- 3 testuser usergroup 11K Feb 14 19:30 file.txt`

        1.  **`-rwxrw-r--` (Permissions String):**
            *   **First Character (File Type):**
                *   `-`: Regular file
                *   `d`: Directory
            *   **Next 9 Characters (Permissions - `rwx` for Read, Write, Execute):** These are divided into three sets of three:
                *   `rwx`: Permissions for the **Owner** of the file/directory.
                *   `rw-`: Permissions for the **Group** that owns the file/directory.
                *   `r--`: Permissions for **Others** (anyone else on the system).
                *   `-`: Indicates that a specific permission (read, write, or execute) is *not* granted.

        2.  **`3` (Hard Links):**
            *   For files, this is the number of hard links pointing to the file.
            *   For directories, it's the number of direct subdirectories, plus the directory itself (`.`) and its parent directory (`..`).

        3.  **`testuser` (Owner):** The username of the owner of the file or directory.

        4.  **`usergroup` (Group):** The group name that owns the file or directory.

        5.  **`11K` (File Size):** The size of the file. (If `-h` is used, it's human-readable, e.g., `11K` for 11 kilobytes).

        6.  **`Feb 14 19:30` (Date Modified):** The last date and time the file or directory was modified.

        7.  **`file.txt` (Name):** The name of the file or directory.

Checking Current User
Checking username:
mario@host~$  
whoami
mario
root@host~#  whoami
root
You can use the whoami  
command to print the 
current user’s usernameChecking username:
mario@host~$  id -u
1000
root@host~#   id -u
0
You can also check the id via 
ud –u. 
Root ID is always 0

Identifying SHELL
$ which $SHELL
Shows the path of the current shell ( Will be used later on scripting ).
Let’s use bash! If your device is not using bash, simply switch 
via:
$ chsh 
or , to specify the path directly:
$ chsh -s /bin/bash

File and Directory Management
These commands help manage files and directories 
efficiently.
•$ pwd - Displays the current directory path.
•$ ls - Displays files and directories. Has the following 
options:
•-l – Long format showing details (permissions, owner , size)
•-a – Show all files, including those hidden (starts with .)
•-h – Human readable format. 
•-R – Recursive, lists contents of subdirectories.
•You can use multiple options, e.g.: -lah
-rwxrw-r-- 3 testuser usergroup 11K Feb 14 19:30 file.txtLong Format:
