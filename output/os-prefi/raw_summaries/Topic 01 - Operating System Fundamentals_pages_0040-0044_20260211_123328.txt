## Learning Guide: Computer System Architecture & Operating Systems

### I. Computer System Architecture: Clustered Systems

**Definition:**
*   A type of **multiprocessor system** that is **loosely coupled**.
*   Composed of two or more interconnected **nodes** (individual computer systems).

**Primary Goals:**
1.  **High-Availability:** Achieved through **redundancy** (having backup components).
    *   Nodes monitor each other.
    *   If a node fails, another monitoring node takes over its tasks and resources (**failover**).
2.  **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Achieved through **parallelization** (distributing tasks to run simultaneously across nodes).
    *   Can offer greater performance than Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) systems for certain workloads.

**How They Work (Monitoring & Failover):**
*   Each node continuously checks the status of other nodes.
*   Upon detecting a failure, a healthy node automatically assumes the responsibilities of the failed node.

**Types of Clustered Systems:**
1.  **Symmetric Clustering:**
    *   All nodes actively run applications.
    *   Each node must be capable of running multiple applications.
    2.  **Asymmetric Clustering:**
    *   One or more nodes are in a **hot-standby** mode.
    *   A hot-standby node is inactive but ready to instantly take over if an active node fails.

### II. Operating System (OS)

**Definition:**
*   Software designed to manage hardware resources and provide services.
*   Enables multiple programs to execute efficiently and safely.

**Core Functions of an Operating System:**
*   **Managing Execution:** Controls processes (running programs) and threads (parts of a program).
*   **Managing Resources:** Allocates and oversees essential hardware resources such as:
    *   CPU (Central Processing Unit)
    *   Memory (RAM)
    *   I/O (Input/Output devices like disks, keyboards, screens)
*   **Coordinating Concurrent Activities:** Ensures multiple programs or users can run simultaneously without interference.
*   **Sharing the System:** Manages access to system resources among multiple users and programs.

Computer System Architecture
Clustered Systems
•A type of multiprocessor system that is loosely coupled .
•Designed for high-availability , achieved through redundancy .
•Composed of two or more nodes (computer system)  joined 
together . 
•Each node can monitor other nodes. If a node fails, a monitoring 
node can take over the task and resources, allowing the former 
node to restart Has two types:
•Symmetric  – all machines are running applications, but requires to be 
able to run more than one application in a system.
•Asymmetric  - one machine is hot-standby mode ready to take cover
•Can provide high-performance computing  (greater than SMP) 
through parallelization .

•structured to manage hardware resources and provide 
services so multiple programs  can execute efficiently and 
safely.
•Managing execution (processes, threads)
•Managing resources (CPU, memory, I/O)
•Coordinating concurrent activities
•Sharing the system among users and programs
