## Learning Guide: Computer System Fundamentals

### 1. What is a Computer System?
A computer system is a collection of interacting components designed to solve computing problems for users.

### 2. Key Components of a Computer System
A computer system is comprised of four essential components:

1.  **Hardware:**
    *   **Function:** Provides the basic physical computing resources.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The "brain" of the computer.
        *   **Memory (RAM):** Stores data and programs currently in use.
        *   **I/O Devices (Input/Output):** Devices for interacting with the computer (e.g., keyboard, monitor, mouse, printer).

2.  **Operating System (OS):**
    *   **Function:** Controls and coordinates how the hardware is used by various application programs and users. It acts as a manager.

3.  **Application Programs:**
    *   **Function:** Define specific ways system resources are used to solve users' computing problems.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Compilers:** Translate programming code into machine-readable instructions.
        *   **Assemblers:** Translate assembly language into machine code.
        *   **Text Editors:** Programs for creating and editing text files.
        *   **Database Systems:** Software for managing data.
        *   **Video Games:** (e.g., Dota2.exe)
        *   **Business Programs:** Software for business operations.

4.  **Users:**
    *   **Function:** The entities interacting with the computer system.
    *   **Examples:** People, other machines, or even other computers.

### 3. How Components Interact (System Hierarchy)
The components of a computer system work together in a layered fashion:

*   **Users** interact with **Application Programs**.
*   **Application Programs** request services from the **Operating System**.
*   The **Operating System** directly manages and controls the **Computer Hardware**.

This can be visualized as a stack:
*   User
*   Application Programs
*   Operating System
*   Computer Hardware

Computer System Components
1. Hardware  – provides basic computing resources (CPU, 
memory, I/O devices).
2. Operating  system  – controls and coordinates the use of the 
hardware among the various application programs for the 
various users.
3. Applications  programs  – define the ways in which the 
system resources are used to solve the computing problems 
of the users (compilers, database systems, video games, 
business programs).
4. Users (people, machines, other computers).
