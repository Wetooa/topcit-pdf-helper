## Operating Systems: A Learning Guide

This guide covers core concepts of Operating Systems, focusing on how they manage processes and different types of OS.

### I. Operating System Basics (Process Management)

*   **Main Function:** An Operating System (OS) manages processes in **Main Memory**.
*   **CPU Activity:** The Central Processing Unit (CPU) executes processes.
*   **Handling Interrupts/I/O:**
    *   When a running process makes an **I/O Request** or an **Interrupt** occurs (e.g., from an I/O device):
        *   The CPU **switches to another job** to prevent it from becoming idle.
        *   An I/O Interrupt requires the CPU to run an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.
        *   The ISR handles the interrupt and marks the original process as ready to run again.
    *   This ensures continuous CPU utilization.

### II. Batch Operating Systems

*   **Process Method:** Executes similar jobs together in **batches**.
*   **User Interaction:** No user interaction is allowed during job execution.
*   **Key Innovation: Multiprogramming**
    *   **Definition:** Keeps multiple processes in main memory simultaneously.
    *   **Purpose:** Organizes jobs (code and data) so that the CPU is always busy, maximizing its use.
*   **Defining Feature:** **Utilization** (maximizing CPU usage).
*   **Interactive Nature:** **NOT interactive**.

### III. Time Sharing Operating Systems

*   **Evolution:** A logical extension of **Multiprogramming**.
*   **Execution Method:** The CPU executes multiple processes by rapidly switching between them.
*   **User Interaction:** Switches happen so frequently that users can interact with each program while it's running.
*   **Multi-User Support:** Allows multiple users to use the system concurrently.
*   **CPU Time Management:**
    *   **Time Slices (Quantum):** CPU time is divided into small, fixed units called time slices.
    *   **Process Allocation:** Each process gets the CPU for one time slice.
    *   **Timer Interrupt:** An interrupt mechanism that enforces time slices, preventing any single process from monopolizing the CPU.
    *   **Input Interrupt:** Allows the system to be responsive to user actions (e.g., keyboard input, mouse clicks).
*   **Defining Feature:** **Responsiveness** (to users and programs).

•What is Time Sharing ?
•a logical extension of 
Multiprogramming
•The CPU executes multiple 
processes by switching among 
them, but the switches occur so 
frequently that the users can
