## Operating System Learning Guide

### 1. Interrupts

*   **Definition:** A signal indicating an event has occurred (from hardware or software).
*   **Purpose:** Requires immediate attention from the CPU.
*   **Process:**
    1.  CPU temporarily pauses its current task.
    2.  Handles the interrupt event.
    3.  Resumes the previously interrupted task.

### 2. Types of Operating Systems

#### A. Batch Operating Systems

*   **Core Concept:** Processes similar jobs in groups (batches).
*   **User Interaction:** No direct user interaction during job execution.
*   **Key Innovation:** Introduced **Multiprogramming**.
    *   **What is Multiprogramming?**
        *   **Goal:** Maximize **CPU Utilization** (keep the CPU busy as much as possible).
        *   **How it Works:**
            *   Multiple processes (jobs, code, and data) are loaded into main memory simultaneously.
            *   When one process needs to wait (e.g., for an I/O request like reading from disk), the OS switches the CPU to another ready process in memory.
        *   **Benefit:** Prevents the CPU from sitting idle while one job waits.

Operating System
•Interrupt
•Signals an occurrence of an event from either hardware  or 
software . 
•Requires immediate attention.
•Temporarily pauses CPU task to handle the event, which will then 
resume the interrupted task after .
