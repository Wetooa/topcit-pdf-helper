Learning Guide: Operating System System Calls

---

### Section 1: Understanding System Calls

*   **What are System Calls?**
    *   A mechanism programs use to request services directly from the **Operating System (OS)**.
    *   They act as a bridge between applications and the OS kernel, allowing applications to perform privileged operations (e.g., accessing hardware, managing processes).

*   **Application Programming Interface (API)**
    *   A set of pre-defined functions that programmers can use to interact with the OS.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Windows API:** For Windows OS.
        *   **POSIX API:** For UNIX, Linux, and macOSX systems.
        *   **Java API:** For programs running on the Java Virtual Machine.

*   **System Call Interface**
    *   Serves as the link between API function calls and the actual system calls provided by the OS.
    *   It intercepts API function calls and then invokes the necessary underlying system calls, which are typically stored in a system call table.

---

### Section 2: How System Calls Work (Execution Flow)

System calls involve a transition from **user mode** to **kernel mode** for security and resource protection.

*   **User Mode:** The environment where application programs execute, with limited access to system resources.
*   **Kernel Mode:** The privileged environment where the OS kernel runs, with full access to all system hardware and resources.

**Simplified Flow:**
1.  A program in **user mode** calls an API function (e.g., `open()`).
2.  The **System Call Interface** intercepts this call.
3.  It then invokes the corresponding system call function within the kernel. This transitions the CPU from user mode to **kernel mode**.
4.  The OS executes the implementation of the system call (e.g., the actual `open()` system call code).
5.  After completion, the OS returns control and data to the program, transitioning the CPU back to **user mode**.

### Section 3: Passing Parameters to the Operating System

When a program makes a system call, it often needs to pass parameters to the OS. Three common methods are:

1.  **Passing via Registers:**
    *   Parameters are stored directly in CPU registers.
    *   **Pros:** Very fast.
    *   **Cons:** Limited number of registers, so this method works best for a small number of parameters.

2.  **Passing via Address (Memory Block):**
    *   Parameters are stored in a contiguous block of memory.
    *   The starting **address** of this memory block is then passed to the OS via a register.
    *   **Pros:** Allows passing many parameters.

3.  **Passing via Stack:**
    *   Parameters are pushed onto the calling process's **stack** by the program.
    *   The operating system then pops these parameters off the stack.
    *   **Pros:** Flexible, allows varying numbers of parameters.

### Section 4: Types of System Calls

System calls are broadly categorized based on the services they provide:

1.  **Process Control:**
    *   Manages the lifecycle and synchronization of processes.
    *   **Examples:** `fork()` (create new process), `exit()` (terminate process).

2.  **File Manipulation:**
    *   Handles operations on files and directories.
    *   **Examples:** `open()` (access a file), `read()` (read from file), `write()` (write to file), `delete()` (remove file).

3.  **Device Manipulation:**
    *   Manages interactions with hardware devices (e.g., printers, disks, network cards).
    *   **Examples:** `ioctl()` (device I/O control), `read()` (read from device), `write()` (write to device).

4.  **Information Maintenance:**
    *   Retrieves and modifies system data and information.
    *   **Examples:** `getpid()` (get process ID), `settimeofday()` (set system time).

5.  **Communication:**
    *   Enables **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**, allowing processes to exchange data.
    *   Methods include message passing and shared memory.
    *   **Examples:** `pipe()` (create a pipe for communication), `socket()` (create a network socket).

6.  **Protection:**
    *   Controls access to system resources and enforces security policies.
    *   **Examples:** `chmod()` (change file permissions), `setuid()` (set user ID for execution).

System Calls
A mechanism used by programs to request services from the 
operating system (OS).
•Application Programming Interface (API)  - specifies a set of 
functions that are available to an application programmer .
•Windows API
•POSIX API (UNIX, Linux, MacOSX)
•Java API (Java Virtual Machine)
•System Call Interface – serves as link to the system calls that 
are made available by the operating systems. Intercepts 
function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system calls 
(stored on a table).

System Calls: Passing Parameters to 
OS?
•Passing via Register  - Parameters 
are stored in registers. However , 
there may be more parameters 
than registers.t
•Passing via Address  - Parameters 
are stored in a block of memory 
and the address is passed via 
Register .
•Passing via Stack  - Parameters 
are pushed in the Process Stack 
by the program and popped off 
by the operating system
