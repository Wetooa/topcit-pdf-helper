## Learning Guide: Operating System Fundamentals

### 1. System Calls

System calls are the interface programs use to request services from the operating system.

**Types of System Calls:**

*   **Process Control:**
    *   **Function:** Manages the creation, termination, and synchronization of processes.
    *   **Examples:** `fork()` (create process), `exit()` (terminate process)
*   **File Manipulation:**
    *   **Function:** Handles operations on files.
    *   **Examples:** `open()` (create/open file), `read()` (read from file), `write()` (write to file), `delete()`
*   **Device Manipulation:**
    *   **Function:** Manages interactions with hardware devices (e.g., printers, disks).
    *   **Examples:** `ioctl()` (device I/O control), `read()`, `write()`
*   **Information Maintenance:**
    *   **Function:** Retrieves and modifies system data.
    *   **Examples:** `getpid()` (get process ID), `settimeofday()` (set system time)
*   **Communication:**
    *   **Function:** Enables Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between different processes.
    *   **Methods:** Message passing or shared memory.
    *   **Examples:** `pipe()` (create a pipe for IPC), `socket()` (create a network socket)
*   **Protection:**
    *   **Function:** Controls access to system resources and enforces security policies.
    *   **Examples:** `chmod()` (change file permissions), `setuid()` (set user ID for execution)

### 2. Linux Systems & Virtualization

To work with Linux commands and scripts, a Linux system is required. It's recommended to use a Virtual Machine to prevent potential damage to your main operating system.

**Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor / VMM):**
*   A program that creates and runs **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.
*   A VM is a virtualized computer system that runs its own operating system (Guest OS) and applications.

**Types of Hypervisors:**

*   **Type I (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):**
    *   **Description:** Runs directly on the host hardware, acting like a lightweight operating system itself.
    *   **Characteristics:** High performance, typically used in server environments.
    *   **Analogy:** "I act like a lightweight OS."
*   **Type II (Hosted Hypervisor):**
    *   **Description:** Runs as a software application on top of an existing operating system (Host OS).
    *   **Characteristics:** Relies on the host OS for hardware access and resource management.
    *   **Analogy:** "I need to borrow resources from the HOST!"
    *   **Examples:** VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop.

### 3. The Shell and Shell Scripts

**Shell:**
*   The **outermost layer** of the Operating System (OS).
*   A special user program that provides an **interface** for users to interact with OS services.
*   Allows users to execute commands (e.g., `cd` for "change directory").

**Shell Scripts:**
*   A way to input multiple commands via a file.
*   Essentially, a text file containing a sequence of commands that the shell can execute.
*   Used to automate tasks.

**Common Linux Shells:**
*   **BASH** (Bourne Again SHell) - The most widely used shell in Linux.
*   **CSH** (C SHell)
*   **KSH** (Korn SHell)

1.Process  Control – Manages process creation, termination, and 
synchronization (e.g., fork(), exit()).
2.File Manipulation  – Handles file operations such as creation, reading, 
writing, and deletion (e.g., open(), read(), write()).
3.Device Manipulation  – Manages interactions with hardware devices like 
printers and disks (e.g., ioctl(), read(), write()).
4.Information  Maintenance  – Retrieves and modifies system data such as 
time, process details, and system configuration (e.g., getpid(), 
settimeofday()).
5.Communication  – Enables inter-process communication (IPC) through 
message passing or shared memory (e.g., pipe(), socket()).

system from this point 
onwards.
Let’s use a Virtual Machine, since we might break some stuff!
