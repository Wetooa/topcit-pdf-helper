### Learning Guide: Computer System Architecture

This guide covers fundamental concepts in fault handling and different computer system architectures.

---

### Section 1: Fault Handling Concepts

These terms describe how systems deal with errors and failures.

*   **Error Isolation:** The process of containing an error to prevent it from spreading and causing further problems within the system.
*   **Failure Hiding:** A system's ability to mask a fault or error from users or other system components, making it appear as if no failure occurred.
*   **Capability Reduction:** When a system continues to operate but with diminished performance or fewer available features due to a fault.
*   **Soft Failure:** A type of failure where a system continues to function, but at a reduced level of performance or functionality, rather than failing completely.
*   **Fault Tolerant:** Describes a system's ability to continue operating correctly even when one or more of its components experience failure.
*   **Graceful Degradation:** A characteristic of fault-tolerant systems, allowing them to continue operating with reduced functionality or performance instead of crashing completely when a part becomes unavailable.

### Section 2: Computer System Architectures

Computer systems are designed in various ways, primarily differing in their use of processors.

#### 1. Single-Processor Systems

*   **Description:** Systems that contain only **one general-purpose Central Processing Unit (CPU)**.
*   **Special-Purpose CPUs:** Can work alongside dedicated microprocessors for specific tasks, such as:
    *   Disk microprocessors
    *   Keyboard microprocessors
    *   Graphics microprocessors

#### 2. Multiprocessor Systems

*   **Also Known As:** Parallel Systems, Multicore Systems.
*   **Description:** Systems featuring **two or more general-purpose CPUs** that communicate closely with each other.
*   **Memory Access Model:**
    *   These systems typically change the memory access model from **Uniform Memory Access (UMA)** to **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)**.
        *   **UMA:** All processors have equal and uniform access times to all memory locations.
        *   **NUMA:** Processors have faster access to their local memory (memory directly attached to them) than to non-local memory (memory attached to other processors).
*   **Key Advantages:**
    *   **Increased Throughput:** More tasks can be completed simultaneously, boosting overall system performance.
    *   **Economy of Scale:** Can be more cost-effective than deploying multiple single-processor systems to achieve similar processing power.
    *   **Increased Reliability:** If one processor fails, the system can often continue operating using the remaining processors, enhancing resilience.
*   **Types of Multiprocessing:**
    *   **Asymmetric Multiprocessing:**
        *   Involves a dedicated "boss" processor that controls the system and assigns tasks to other "worker" processors. This creates a master-slave or boss-worker relationship.
    *   **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):**
        *   The most common type.
        *   All processors are considered peers; any processor can perform any task within the operating system.

#### 3. Clustered Systems

*   **Description:** A specialized type of multiprocessor system where multiple independent computer systems (called nodes) are loosely connected.
*   **Purpose:** Primarily designed to provide **high availability** by allowing other nodes to take over tasks if one node fails, ensuring continuous operation.

Single-Processor Systems
•There is only one general-purpose 
CPU.
•May work with special-purpose 
CPU such as:
•Disk microprocessor
•Keyboard microprocessor
•Graphics microprocessor

Multiprocessor Systems
•Aka Parallel Systems  or Multicore 
Systems
•Has two or more general-purpose CPU.
•Changes memory access model from 
uniform memory access (UMA)  to 
non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
•Three main advantages:
•Increased throughput
•Economy of scale
•Increased reliability

Computer System Architecture
Multiprocessor Systems
• Comes in two types:
•Asymmetric multiprocessing – consists of a Boss processor that 
controls the system. This scheme defines master-slave / boss-
worker relationship. 
•Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) – the most common type. Each 
processor , which are all peers, performs all task within the OS.
