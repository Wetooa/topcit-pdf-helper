## Computer Systems: A Learning Guide

### 1. Early Computer History

*   **Punch Card Programming (c. 1970):**
    *   Early computer programming primarily relied on punch cards.
*   **Early Computers (c. 1950s):**
    *   **Examples:** IBM 704, large computers used by NASA.
    *   **Size:** Often room-sized.
    *   **Operation:** Required manual input by "Computer Operators" who would physically feed programs into the machine.
    *   **Concurrency:** Could only execute one program at a time.
    *   **Bottleneck:** As computers became more powerful, the manual operation process became a significant bottleneck, slowing down overall system usage.

### 2. Understanding the Operating System (OS)

*   **Definition:** An Operating System (OS) is a program that acts as an **intermediary** (a go-between) between a computer user and the computer hardware.
*   **Key Goals of an OS:**
    *   **Execute User Programs:** To run user applications and simplify problem-solving.
    *   **Convenience:** To make the computer system easy and convenient to use.
    *   **Efficiency:** To manage and use the computer hardware in an efficient manner.

### 3. Computer System Components

(used to be a job) that 
will feed the program 
into the computer 
manually .Old Computers , such 
as the IBM 704 , can 
only run one program 
at a time.
But soon, computer 
became too powerful 
that the manual 
operation became the 
bottleneck.

What is an Operating System?
•A program  that acts as an 
intermediary between a user of a 
computer and the computer 
hardware.
•Operating system goals:
•Execute user programs and make solving 
user problems easier .
•Make the computer system convenient to 
use.
•Use the computer hardware in an 
efficient manner .
No, our friend Edgar is no longer 
the Operating System  He
