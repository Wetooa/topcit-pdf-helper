## Operating System: A Learning Guide

This guide summarizes key concepts about Operating Systems (OS) from the provided text, focusing on essential information for effective learning.

---

### 1. Operating System (OS)

**Definition:**
The OS is a fundamental software component that manages hardware resources and provides services.

**Core Functions:**
*   Enables multiple programs to execute efficiently and safely.
*   Manages program execution (Processes, Threads).
*   Manages system resources (CPU, Memory, I/O devices).
*   Coordinates concurrent activities.
*   Facilitates sharing the system among different users and programs.

---

### 2. Process

**Definition:**
A process is a self-contained execution environment.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   Each process has a complete and private set of basic runtime resources.
*   It has its own dedicated memory space, isolating it from other processes.

---

### 3. Thread

**Definition:**
A thread is the smallest unit of CPU execution *within* a process.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   Threads within the same process share basic runtime resources (e.g., memory space, open files) of that process.
*   A single-threaded process has only one thread of execution.
*   A multi-threaded process has multiple threads running concurrently within its single process environment, sharing the process's resources while having their own independent execution paths (like separate stacks, program counters, and registers).

---

### 4. Interrupt

**Definition:**
An interrupt is a signal indicating that an event has occurred.

**Key Information:**
*   **Source:** Can originate from either hardware (e.g., I/O completion, timer expiration) or software (e.g., system calls, errors).
*   **Requirement:** Requires immediate attention from the CPU.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Temporarily pauses the CPU's current task.
    2.  Handles the event associated with the interrupt.
    3.  Resumes the interrupted task afterward.

Operating System
•Interrupt
•Signals an occurrence of an event from either hardware  or 
software . 
•Requires immediate attention.
•Temporarily pauses CPU task to handle the event, which will then 
resume the interrupted task after .
