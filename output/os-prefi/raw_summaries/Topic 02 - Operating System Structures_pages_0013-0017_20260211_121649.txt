Learning Guide:

## 1. Hypervisor

*   **Definition:** Also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), a hypervisor is a program that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).
*   **Function:** It allows multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Type I (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):**
        *   Runs directly on the host hardware.
        *   Acts like a lightweight operating system.
        *   Provides better performance and security.
    *   **Type II (Hosted Hypervisor):**
        *   Runs on top of an existing operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
        *   Relies on the host OS for resource management.

## 2. Shell

*   **Definition:** The outermost layer of an Operating System (OS) and a special user program that provides an interface for the user to interact with OS services.
*   **Function:** Allows users to input commands to the OS (e.g., navigating directories, running applications).
*   **Shell Scripts:** Files containing a sequence of commands that can be executed automatically.
*   **Examples (Common Linux Shells):**
    *   BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
    *   CSH (C SHell)
    *   KSH (Korn SHell)

## 3. Command Line Interface (CLI) Basics

The Command Line Interface (CLI) or Command Interpreter (CI) is a text-based interface used to interact with the operating system.

*   **Prompt Indicators:** These symbols indicate the current user's privilege level at the command prompt.
    *   `$` : Indicates the current user is a **normal user**.
    *   `#` : Indicates the current user is a **root user** (superuser with administrative privileges).
*   **User and Hostname Indicator:**
    *   `username@hostname` : Displays the current logged-in user (`username`) and the name of the device (`hostname`).
*   **Special Directories:**
    *   `~` (Tilde): Represents the current user's **home directory** (e.g., `/home/<username>/` on Linux).
    *   `/` (Forward Slash): Represents the **root directory** of the file system.

Working with CLI/CI
This is how our command line interface will look like.
On prompts, there is always a preceding $ or a # symbol.
$ - indicates the current user is a normal user
# - indicates the current user is a root user (superuser)

There is also the indicator of the current user on which 
device.
username@hostname

There are also some special directory ~ and /
~ - a user’s home directory ( /home/<username>/ )
/ - root directory
