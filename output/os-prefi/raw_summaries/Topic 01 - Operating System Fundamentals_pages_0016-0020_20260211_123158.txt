## Computer System Storage Structures: Learning Guide

This guide explains the different types of computer memory and storage, organized from fastest/most expensive to slowest/least expensive.

### I. Core Storage Principles

*   **Hierarchy:** Higher levels of storage are faster, but more expensive per bit.
*   **Volatility:**
    *   **Volatile:** Requires power to maintain stored information. Data is lost when power is off (e.g., Registers, Cache, RAM).
    *   **Non-volatile:** Retains stored information even without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).

---

### II. Primary Storage (Volatile)

These are faster memory types directly accessible by the CPU, primarily used for active data.

#### 1. Registers

*   **Location:** Inside the CPU core.
*   **Speed:** Fastest possible memory in a computer.
*   **Size:** Extremely small (bits or bytes).
*   **Purpose:** Holds immediate data and instructions actively being processed by the CPU (e.g., numbers for calculations).
*   **Volatility:** Volatile.
*   **Examples:** RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSP, RBP.

#### 2. Cache (CPU Cache)

*   **Purpose:** Stores frequently used instructions and data to reduce access time to main memory. It acts as a buffer.
*   **Function:** When the CPU needs data, it first checks the cache.
    *   **Cache Hit:** Data is found in cache, resulting in fast retrieval.
    *   **Cache Miss:** Data is not in cache, so the CPU retrieves it from Main Memory, which is slower.
*   **Levels & Typical Sizes (from fastest/smallest to slowest/largest):**
    *   **L1 Cache:** Smallest (e.g., Kilobytes - KBs), fastest.
    *   **L2 Cache:** Larger than L1 (e.g., KBs to Megabytes - MBs), slower than L1.
    *   **L3 Cache:** Largest (e.g., MBs), slower than L2. Often shared among CPU cores.
*   **Volatility:** Volatile.

#### 3. Main Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)

*   **Size:** Much larger than cache (e.g., Gigabytes - GBs).
*   **Speed:** Slower than cache, but significantly faster than secondary storage.
*   **Purpose:** Holds all currently running programs, operating system data, and open files.
*   **Volatility:** Volatile.

### III. Secondary Storage (Non-Volatile)

These are slower, larger, and cheaper storage types used for long-term data retention.

#### 1. Solid State Drive (SSD)

*   **Mechanism:** Uses flash memory; has no moving parts.
*   **Speed:** Fast due to electronic data access.
*   **Cost:** More expensive per bit compared to HDDs.
*   **Volatility:** Non-volatile.

#### 2. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

*   **Mechanism:** Uses spinning magnetic platters and read/write heads to store and retrieve data.
*   **Speed:** Slower than SSDs due to mechanical moving parts.
*   **Cost:** Cheaper per bit compared to SSDs.
*   **Volatility:** Non-volatile.
