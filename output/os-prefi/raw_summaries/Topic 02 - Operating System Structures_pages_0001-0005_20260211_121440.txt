## Operating System Structures & Shell Scripting: Learning Guide

This guide summarizes essential concepts about Operating System (OS) structures and shell scripting.

---

### 1. Operating System Fundamentals

The Operating System (OS) is responsible for managing system components, facilitating program execution, and providing various services to users and other system programs.

**Key OS Services:**
*   **Program Execution:** Running user programs and system processes.
*   **File Management:** Creating, deleting, listing, printing, copying, and executing files.
*   **Communication:** Enabling interaction between different processes and users.
*   **Resource Management:** Managing system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

---

### 2. User and OS Interfaces

Almost all OSs provide a User Interface (UI) for interaction. The main types include:

1.  **Command Line Interface (CLI) / Command Interpreter (CI)**
    *   Users input commands directly via text.
    *   **Command Interpreter (CI):** Another name for the CLI, responsible for interpreting and executing commands.

2.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
    *   User-friendly interface using visual elements (icons, windows, menus).
    *   Relies on dedicated I/O devices (e.g., mouse, keyboard) for selections and data input.

3.  **Batch Interface**
    *   Commands are entered into files.
    *   These command files are then executed as a batch.

---

### 3. Shells and Shell Scripting (CLI/CI Focus)

On systems with a CLI, the command interpreters are often known as **Shells**.

*   **Shells:** Specific command interpreters that users can choose from (e.g., Bash, Zsh in Linux). They process user commands.
*   **Shell Scripts:**
    *   A set of command-line steps (commands) saved in a file.
    *   Can be executed like a program to automate tasks.

**Common File Manipulation Commands (Examples):**
Many shell commands are used for managing files:
*   `Create` (e.g., `touch` for new files, `mkdir` for new directories)
*   `Delete` (e.g., `rm` for files, `rmdir` for empty directories)
*   `List` (e.g., `ls` to list contents of directories)
*   `Print` (e.g., `cat` to display file content)
*   `Copy` (e.g., `cp` to copy files or directories)
*   `Execute` (e.g., `./script.sh` to run a script, or simply typing a program's name)

User and OS Interface
•Almost all OS have a user interface (UI), which can be any of 
the ff:
•Command Line Interface (CLI)  – AKA command interpreter (CI) . 
Uses command that are directly inputted.
•Graphical User Interface (GUI)  – user friendly interface with 
dedicated I/O devices to make selections and input data
•Batch – commands are entered into files, then files are run.

Uses command that are directly inputted .
•On systems with multiple Command Interpreters to choose 
from, the interpreters are known as  Shells.
•Shell Scripts  – set of command line steps that can be run like 
a program.
•Many of the commands is for file manipulation:
•Create, Delete, List, Print, Copy, Execute, 
etc.
