## Computer System Storage and Processing Basics

This guide summarizes the essential components and processes involved in computer system storage and computation.

### 1. Program Execution & Memory Hierarchy

When a computer program runs, its data and instructions move through various storage components:

*   **Program Loading:**
    *   A program (application or operating system code) is initially stored on the **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**.
    *   To run, the program is copied from the HDD into **Main Memory (RAM)**. The CPU directly accesses instructions and data from RAM during execution.

*   **Actual Computation:**
    *   The core processing and execution of instructions occur within the **CPU Core**.
    *   The CPU uses small, very fast storage locations called **Registers** (e.g., RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSP, RBP) to temporarily hold data and addresses critical for current operations. This is where active computation takes place.

*   **Cache Memory (Speeding up CPU Access):**
    *   To bridge the speed gap between the CPU and Main Memory (RAM), a faster, smaller memory called **Cache** is used.
    *   When the CPU needs data, it first checks the Cache before going to Main Memory.
    *   Cache acts as an "interceptor," holding frequently used data and instructions close to the CPU for quicker access.
    *   **Cache Hierarchy:** Cache is typically organized into multiple levels, each with different speed and size characteristics:
        *   **L1 Cache:** Smallest and fastest cache, often located directly on the CPU core. (e.g., "smol")
        *   **L2 Cache:** Larger than L1, but slower. (e.g., ~KBs - Kilobytes)
        *   **L3 Cache:** Largest among the cache levels, but slower than L1/L2. Often shared across multiple CPU cores. (e.g., ~MBs - Megabytes)
