### **1. Understanding File Permissions (Long Format `ls -l`)**

The `ls -l` command displays detailed information about files and directories. Here's how to interpret its output, like `-rwxrw-r-- 3 testuser usergroup 11K Feb 14 19:30 file.txt`:

*   **1. File Type & Permissions (`-rwxrw-r--`)**
    *   **First Character (File Type):**
        *   `d`: Directory
        *   `-`: Regular file
    *   **Next 9 Characters (Permissions):** Divided into three sets of three characters (`rwx`).
        *   **Owner Permissions (1st set):** `rwx` (read, write, execute)
        *   **Group Permissions (2nd set):** `rw-` (read, write, no execute)
        *   **Others Permissions (3rd set):** `r--` (read, no write, no execute)
        *   **Key:**
            *   `r`: Read permission
            *   `w`: Write permission
            *   `x`: Execute permission (for files) or permission to enter/list directory contents (for directories)
            *   `-`: No permission

*   **2. Hard Links (`3`)**
    *   Number of direct links to the file's content (includes itself and parent directory for directories).

*   **3. Owner (`testuser`)**
    *   The username of the file or directory's owner.

*   **4. Group (`usergroup`)**
    *   The group that owns the file or directory.

*   **5. File Size (`11K`)**
    *   Size of the file (e.g., `11K` for 11 Kilobytes).

*   **6. Date Modified (`Feb 14 19:30`)**
    *   Date and time the file or directory was last modified.

*   **7. Name (`file.txt`)**
    *   The name of the file or directory.

### **2. Essential File & Directory Commands**

These commands help you navigate, create, delete, copy, and move files and directories.

*   **Change Directory:**
    *   `cd <directory>`: Changes the current working directory to `<directory>`.
    *   `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.
    *   `cd /`: Go to the root directory.

*   **Create Directory:**
    *   `mkdir <directory_name>`: Creates a new directory.
    *   `mkdir -p <parent_dir>/<new_dir>`: Creates parent directories if they don't exist.

*   **Delete Directory:**
    *   `rmdir <empty_directory>`: Deletes an *empty* directory.

*   **Delete File or Directory:**
    *   `rm <file_or_directory>`: Deletes files or directories.
        *   `-r`: (Recursive) Deletes directories and their contents. Required for non-empty directories.
        *   `-f`: (Force) Deletes without prompting for confirmation.
        *   `-i`: (Interactive) Asks for confirmation before each deletion.
        *   `-v`: (Verbose) Shows deleted files.

*   **Copy Files/Directories:**
    *   `cp <source> <destination>`: Copies files or directories.
        *   `-r`: (Recursive) Copies directories and their contents.
        *   `-i`: (Interactive) Prompts before overwriting an existing file.
        *   `-u`: (Update) Copies only if the source is newer than the destination, or if the destination doesn't exist.
        *   `-v`: (Verbose) Shows progress.

*   **Move or Rename Files/Directories:**
    *   `mv <source> <destination>`: Moves or renames files or directories.
        *   `-i`: (Interactive) Asks before overwriting an existing file.
        *   `-u`: (Update) Moves only if the source is newer than the destination, or if the destination doesn't exist.
        *   `-v`: (Verbose) Shows progress.

### **3. File Viewing & Editing**

These commands help you view and modify file contents.

*   **View Entire File:**
    *   `cat <file.txt>`: Displays the entire content of a file directly to the terminal.

*   **View File with Scrolling:**
    *   `less <file.txt>`: Displays file contents page by page, allowing scrolling.
        *   **Navigation:**
            *   `SPACE`: Scroll down one page.
            *   `b`: Scroll up one page.
            *   `/keyword`: Search for a specific `keyword`.
            *   `q`: Quit `less`.

*   **Edit Files (Nano Editor):**
    *   `nano <file.txt>`: Opens a file in the Nano text editor.
        *   **Shortcuts:**
            *   `CTRL-X`: Exit (will prompt to save if changes were made).
            *   `CTRL-O`: Save changes.
            *   `CTRL-W`: Search for text within the file.
