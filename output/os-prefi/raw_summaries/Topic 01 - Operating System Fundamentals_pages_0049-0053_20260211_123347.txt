## Operating Systems: Batch Operating Systems

This guide focuses on **Batch Operating Systems** and the concept of **Multiprogramming**.

### 1. Batch Operating Systems

*   **Definition:** These systems process similar jobs together in groups, called "batches."
*   **Interaction:** No direct user interaction is possible during a job's execution.
*   **Key Innovation:** Introduced **Multiprogramming**.

### 2. Multiprogramming (for CPU Utilization)

*   **Goal:** Maximize CPU (Central Processing Unit) usage and prevent it from sitting idle.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Multiple processes (jobs) are loaded and kept in the main memory simultaneously.
    *   The Operating System organizes these jobs (code and data).
    *   **CPU Switching:**
        *   When a currently executing process needs to perform an I/O (Input/Output) operation (which takes time), the CPU would normally be idle.
        *   With multiprogramming, the CPU quickly switches to another ready process in memory. This keeps the CPU busy.
        *   When the I/O operation for the original process completes, an **I/O Interrupt** occurs.
        *   The CPU runs an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** to handle this interrupt and marks the original process as ready to run again.
*   **Key Feature:** High **CPU Utilization** (keeping the CPU as busy as possible).
