## Operating System Fundamentals (CS348) - Learning Guide

This guide covers the fundamental concepts of Operating Systems, focusing on the meaning, importance, basic operations, structures, and historical context.

---

### 1. Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

*   Define what an Operating System (OS) is and explain its importance.
*   Identify core concepts related to Operating Systems.
*   Compare different types of Operating Systems.
*   Discuss the basic operations of a computer system.
*   Differentiate various computer-system structures.
*   Classify basic hardware components and understand their protection mechanisms.

---

### 2. Historical Context of Computer Systems

Understanding the evolution of computer systems helps to grasp the need for Operating Systems.

#### Early Computer Era (Pre-OS)

*   **Size:** Early computers (e.g., NASA 1957) were often **room-sized**.
*   **Programming Method:** Programming in the 1970s (and earlier) often involved **punch cards**.
*   **Manual Operation:**
    *   **Computer Operators** were a dedicated job role.
    *   Their task was to **manually feed programs** into the computer.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Old computers, such as the **IBM 704**, could only **run one program at a time**.
*   **The Bottleneck Problem:** As computers became more powerful, the **manual operation by humans became the main bottleneck**, significantly slowing down the overall process and wasting valuable computer time.

(used to be a job) that 
will feed the program 
into the computer 
manually .Old Computers , such 
as the IBM 704 , can 
only run one program 
at a time.
But soon, computer 
became too powerful 
that the manual 
operation became the 
bottleneck.
