## Learning Guide: Time Sharing Operating Systems

### 1. What is Time Sharing?

*   A logical extension of **Multiprogramming**.
*   The CPU quickly switches between multiple running programs (processes).
*   Allows multiple users to interact with their programs simultaneously.
*   Users experience this as if they have exclusive use of the CPU, due to the rapid switching.

### 2. How Time Sharing Works

*   **CPU Time Division**: The CPU's time is divided into small, fixed units called **time slices** (or **quantum**).
*   **Process Execution**: Each process gets to use the CPU for one time slice.
*   **Timer Interrupt**: A special signal called a **timer interrupt** occurs at the end of each time slice, forcing the CPU to switch to the next process.
*   **Input Interrupt**: An **input interrupt** allows the system to respond immediately to user actions (like keyboard input or mouse clicks).

### 3. Key Characteristic

*   **Responsiveness**: The defining feature of time-sharing systems is their ability to respond quickly to user interactions.

### 4. Important Note

*   A **scheduling algorithm** is used by the operating system to decide which process gets the CPU next and manage the allocation of time slices.

•What is Time Sharing ?
•a logical extension of 
Multiprogramming
•The CPU executes multiple 
processes by switching among 
them, but the switches occur so 
frequently that the users can 
interact  with each program

Note that this is just a rough example, there 
is going to be some scheduling algorithm 
involved
