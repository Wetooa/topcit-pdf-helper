# Operating System Basics: User Interfaces & System Calls

## 1. User and OS Interface (UI)

The User Interface (UI) is how users interact with the Operating System (OS).
There are three main types:

*   **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
    *   Also known as a **Command Interpreter (CI)**.
    *   Users input text commands directly.
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
    *   User-friendly interface using visual elements (icons, windows, menus).
    *   Requires dedicated input/output devices (like a mouse and monitor) for selections and data input.
*   **Batch Interface**:
    *   Commands are pre-entered into files.
    *   These files are then executed as a whole.

## 2. Command Line Interface (CLI) / Command Interpreter (CI) Details

The CLI takes direct text commands from the user.

*   **Shells**: On systems with multiple Command Interpreters, these interpreters are called Shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell).
*   **Shell Scripts**: A sequence of command-line steps saved in a file that can be run like a program.
*   **Common Commands**: Many CLI commands are for file manipulation, such as:
    *   Create, Delete, List, Print, Copy, Execute files, etc.

### CLI Command Execution Approaches

Commands in a CLI can be handled in two ways:

1.  **Interpreter Implements Commands**:
    *   The code for the command is built directly into the command interpreter.
    *   **Example**: `cd myFolder` (change directory) in Windows Command Prompt. The `cd` logic is part of the interpreter.
2.  **Program Implements Commands**:
    *   The command is a separate executable file (program). The interpreter just runs this program.
    *   **Example**: `rm file.txt` (remove file) in UNIX/Linux. The `rm` command is a separate program that the interpreter executes with `file.txt` as a parameter.

## 3. System Calls

**System Calls** are a mechanism for programs to request services directly from the Operating System (OS). They provide a controlled way for user-level programs to interact with the OS kernel.

*   **Application Programming Interface (API)**:
    *   A set of functions available for application programmers to use.
    *   APIs provide a standardized way for programs to access OS features without needing to know the low-level details of system calls.
    *   **Examples**:
        *   Windows API
        *   POSIX API (for UNIX, Linux, macOS)
        *   Java API (for Java Virtual Machine)

*   **System Call Interface**:
    *   This acts as a bridge between the API calls made by an application and the actual system calls provided by the OS.
    *   It intercepts API function calls (e.g., `open()`) and then invokes the necessary underlying system call from a table of available OS services.

### How System Calls Work (User Mode vs. Kernel Mode)

The OS operates in two main modes:

*   **User Mode**: Where user applications run. They have restricted access to system resources.
*   **Kernel Mode**: Where the OS kernel runs. It has full access to all hardware and system resources.

Here's the typical flow for a system call:

1.  A program in **User Mode** calls a function (e.g., `open()`) from an **API**.
2.  The **System Call Interface** intercepts this API call.
3.  The system transitions from **User Mode** to **Kernel Mode**.
4.  The OS executes its specific **implementation of the system call** (e.g., the `open()` function within the OS kernel).
5.  After the service is completed, the system returns to **User Mode**, and the result is passed back to the program.

User and OS Interface
•Almost all OS have a user interface (UI), which can be any of 
the ff:
•Command Line Interface (CLI)  – AKA command interpreter (CI) . 
Uses command that are directly inputted.
•Graphical User Interface (GUI)  – user friendly interface with 
dedicated I/O devices to make selections and input data
•Batch – commands are entered into files, then files are run.  

--- Page 5 ---
User and OS Interface: CLI / CI
Uses command that are directly inputted .
•On systems with multiple Command Interpreters to choose 
from, the interpreters are known as  Shells.
•Shell Scripts  – set of command line steps that can be run like 
a program.
•Many of the commands is for file manipulation:
•Create, Delete, List, Print, Copy, Execute, 
etc.

Has two approach:
Interpreter implements 
CommandsProgram implements 
Commands
cd myFolder
windows command promptrm file.txt
UNIX
The code for cd (change working 
directory) is stored in the 
interpreter .The code for rm (remove) is stored 
on a separate file, rm. Interpreter 
executes rm with parameter 
file.txt

System Calls
A mechanism used by programs to request services from the 
operating system (OS).
•Application Programming Interface (API)  - specifies a set of 
functions that are available to an application programmer .
•Windows API
•POSIX API (UNIX, Linux, MacOSX)
•Java API (Java Virtual Machine)
•System Call Interface – serves as link to the system calls that 
are made available by the operating systems. Intercepts 
function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system calls 
(stored on a table).
