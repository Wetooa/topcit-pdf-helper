### **Computer System Storage Structures: A Learning Guide**

This guide outlines the main components where a computer stores and processes information.

---

### **1. Main Memory (RAM)**

*   **What it is:** Random Access Memory (RAM) is the primary working memory of a computer.
*   **Purpose:** Holds all currently running programs and open files.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Size:** Much larger than caches (typically measured in Gigabytes - GBs).
    *   **Speed:** Fast, but not as fast as CPU caches.
    *   **Volatility:** **Volatile** – meaning all data is lost when the computer is turned off or loses power.

---

### **2. Secondary Memories**

*   **What it is:** Long-term storage for programs and data.
*   **Purpose:** Stores installed programs and user files permanently.
*   **Key Characteristic:** **Non-Volatile** – meaning data is retained even when the computer is turned off.

**Types of Secondary Memory:**

*   **a. Solid State Drive (SSD)**
    *   **Mechanism:** No moving parts; stores data electronically on flash memory chips.
    *   **Speed:** Very fast.
    *   **Cost:** More expensive than HDDs.

*   **b. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses spinning magnetic platters to store data.
    *   **Speed:** Slower than SSDs.
    *   **Cost:** Cheaper than SSDs.

---

### **3. Program Storage & Execution Flow**

*   **Program Storage:** Installed programs are permanently stored on **Secondary Memories** (e.g., an HDD or SSD).
*   **Program Execution:** When you run a program:
    1.  A copy of the program is loaded from **Secondary Memory** (e.g., HDD/SSD)
    2.  ...into **Main Memory (RAM)**. This allows the CPU to access it quickly.

---

### **4. Where Computation Happens**

*   **CPU Core:** The actual processing (computations, calculations, instructions) is performed by the **CPU Core**.
*   **Registers:** Within the CPU Core, specialized, ultra-fast memory locations called **Registers** (e.g., RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSP, RBP) are used to hold data that the CPU is actively working on at that very moment.
    *   While the program and data reside in RAM, the CPU loads small pieces into its registers for actual manipulation.
