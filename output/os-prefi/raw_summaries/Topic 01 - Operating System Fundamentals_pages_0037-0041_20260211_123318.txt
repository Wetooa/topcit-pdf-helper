## Computer System Architecture: Learning Guide

### I. Multiprocessor Systems

**What they are:**
*   Also known as **Parallel Systems** or **Multicore Systems**.
*   Contain **two or more general-purpose Central Processing Units (CPUs)**.
*   Change the memory access model from Uniform Memory Access (UMA) to **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)**.

**Key Advantages:**
1.  **Increased Throughput:** Can process more tasks simultaneously.
2.  **Economy of Scale:** Often more cost-effective than multiple single-processor systems.
3.  **Increased Reliability:** System can potentially continue operating if one processor fails.

**Types of Multiprocessing:**

1.  **Asymmetric Multiprocessing:**
    *   One designated "Boss processor" controls the system.
    *   Operates on a master-slave or boss-worker relationship.

2.  **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):**
    *   The most common type.
    *   All processors are considered **peers** and can perform any task within the operating system.

**Multicore Chips:**
*   Consist of **multiple computing cores on a single chip**.
*   **Faster** than traditional multiprocessor systems (which might use multiple separate CPU chips).
*   **Use less power** compared to an equivalent number of single-core chips.

### II. Clustered Systems

**What they are:**
*   A type of multiprocessor system that is **loosely coupled** (meaning components are more independent, typically connected over a network, rather than sharing memory directly).
*   Composed of **two or more independent computer systems (nodes)** joined together.

**Primary Goal:**
*   **High-Availability:** Achieved through **redundancy**, ensuring continuous operation even if components fail.

**How they handle failure:**
*   Each node continuously monitors other nodes in the cluster.
*   If a node fails, a monitoring node can automatically **take over its tasks and resources**.
*   This allows the failed node to be restarted without causing significant downtime.

**Types of Clustered Systems:**

1.  **Symmetric Clustering:**
    *   All machines (nodes) are actively running applications.
    *   Requires systems capable of running multiple applications concurrently.

2.  **Asymmetric Clustering:**
    *   One machine (node) is in **hot-standby mode**, meaning it's idle but ready to immediately take over if an active node fails.

**Performance:**
*   Can provide **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** through parallelization.
*   Often achieve **greater performance than SMP systems** for specific workloads.

Computer System Architecture
Multiprocessor Systems
•Aka Parallel Systems  or Multicore 
Systems
•Has two or more general-purpose CPU.
•Changes memory access model from 
uniform memory access (UMA)  to 
non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
•Three main advantages:
•Increased throughput
•Economy of scale
•Increased reliability

Computer System Architecture
Multiprocessor Systems
• Comes in two types:
•Asymmetric multiprocessing – consists of a Boss processor that 
controls the system. This scheme defines master-slave / boss-
worker relationship. 
•Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) – the most common type. Each 
processor , which are all peers, performs all task within the OS.

•Multicore  chips
•Multiple computing 
cores on a single 
chip
•Faster than the usual 
multiprocessor .
•Uses less power than 
similar number of 
single core chips.

•A type of multiprocessor system that is loosely coupled .
•Designed for high-availability , achieved through redundancy .
•Composed of two or more nodes (computer system)  joined 
together . 
•Each node can monitor other nodes. If a node fails, a monitoring 
node can take over the task and resources, allowing the former 
node to restart Has two types:
•Symmetric  – all machines are running applications, but requires to be 
able to run more than one application in a system.
•Asymmetric  - one machine is hot-standby mode ready to take cover
•Can provide high-performance computing  (greater than SMP) 
through parallelization .
