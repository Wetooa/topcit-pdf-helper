## Computer System Architecture: Learning Guide

This guide simplifies key concepts from Pages 31-35 for efficient learning.

### 1. Fault Handling

**Fault handling** refers to how a computer system deals with errors or component failures to maintain operation.

#### 1.1. Graceful Degradation
*   **Definition:** The system continues to provide service, but its performance is reduced proportionally to the level of hardware still working.
*   **Outcome:** System remains usable, but with decreased performance.
*   **Analogy:** A car losing a cylinder can still drive, but slower and with less power.

#### 1.2. Soft Failure
*   **Definition:** The system can detect and isolate errors or faulty components without crashing entirely.
*   **Outcome:** The system continues running, but the problematic component or process is quarantined or shut down.
*   **Analogy:** A building's fire alarm system detecting a fire in one room and sealing off that room while the rest of the building remains operational.

#### 1.3. Fault Tolerant
*   **Definition:** The system can continue operating normally and fully even if a single component fails. It masks the failure from the user.
*   **Outcome:** The system continues normal operation despite the component failure, as if nothing happened.
*   **Analogy:** A plane with multiple engines; if one fails, the others compensate, and the flight continues normally.

#### 1.4. Summary of Fault Handling Types

| Type                  | Outcome                | Description                                         |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Capability is Reduced  | Service continues, but performance drops.           |
| **Soft Failure**      | Error is Isolated      | System runs; faulty part is detected and contained. |
| **Fault Tolerant**    | Failure is Hidden      | System operates normally despite failure.           |

### 2. Processor Architectures

This section outlines different ways processors can be organized within a computer system.

#### 2.1. Single-Processor Systems
*   **Configuration:** Contain one main general-purpose processor.
*   **Support:** May include additional special-purpose processors (e.g., for graphics, networking) but only one central CPU.

#### 2.2. Multiprocessor Systems
*   **Also known as:** Parallel or Multicore systems.
*   **Configuration:** Feature multiple processors (cores) that are in close communication.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Asymmetric Multiprocessing:** Processors have specific roles (e.g., one master CPU, others perform specific tasks).
    *   **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** All processors are identical and can perform any task, sharing resources equally.

#### 2.3. Clustered Systems
*   **Type:** A specific type of multiprocessor system.
*   **Configuration:** Composed of multiple individual computer systems (nodes) that are loosely coupled (less tightly integrated than a single multiprocessor machine).
*   **Purpose:** Primarily designed to provide **high-availability**, meaning they can continue operating even if one or more nodes fail. They achieve this by distributing workloads and having redundant components.
